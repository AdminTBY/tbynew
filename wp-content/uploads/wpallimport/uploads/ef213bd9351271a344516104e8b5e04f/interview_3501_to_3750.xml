		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your vision to provide both the entertainment element and public health element of sport?</h4><p>When I started in the GSA, I asked two main questions: How usable and functional are our sport facilities and how accessible are they to the public? It turns out, we have 40-year-old facilities that are in mint condition, as they were hardly used. Our survey in 2015 found that only 13% of male Saudis over the age of 15 practice sports more than half an hour per week. Saudi Arabia has one of the highest per capita figures in the world for obesity and Stage II diabetes, and the latter is directly correlated with activity. We targeted increasing the sports participation ratio to 20% by 2020 and 40% by 2030. A large part of the journey is raising awareness about the risks and benefits at an early age. We developed a national strategy for sports based on three pillars. The first is getting everyone in Saudi involved in our activities and familiar with our facilities. This means sports at all levels, which brings us to the second pillar of building a feeding ground and a talent development system for sports clubs to nurture future champions. The third pillar is the sports economy; we should make it easier for the private sector to come in. Today, around 80-90% of the contributions to the sports sector come from the government, which is not sustainable. To move our objectives forward, we now have the Mass Participation Federation, headed by Princess Reema. Also, we reconstructed our Olympic committee in line with the requirements of the International Olympic Committee. Finally, we have doubled the number of national sports federations from 32 to 64 to help athletes get accredited.</p><h4>Could you tell us more about the Quality of Life program and the role of GSA?</h4><p>The program has four pillars: culture, entertainment, and two in sports, meaning GSA owns 50% of the initiative. The first program again focuses on increasing mass participation, with the objective of reaching 40% by 2030, while the second program focuses on better positioning the Kingdom in the international sports arena. To develop this as a continuous system, we need more private sector participation. In the Quality of Life program, we look at how the sports economy can affect the GDP, how to build a conducive ecosystem, and how to create jobs out of it. We benchmarked ourselves against Canada, a country with similar demographics, economic characteristics, and climate challenges. With a similar population, we have around 12,500 people working directly in the sport sector, while Canada has around 300,000 employees. The share in the total GDP is not even measured. From our numbers, it is around 0.07%, compared to around 1% in Canada. The Quality of Life program has 21 initiatives structured around our three main pillars. Within mass participation, two key initiatives are Active Cities and Active People. For this, we will collaborate directly with municipalities and development authorities. When we held a two-day event in Riyadh in November, 11,000 people showed up, indicating there is definitely a platform for this. King Abdullah Sport City in Jeddah now opens every Tuesday for various sporting activities, including for families and women. According to our survey, 80% of participants are convinced that sports makes their lives better. Our job is to get them started and educate them on the possibilities. With 70% of our population under the age of 30, this will catch on quickly.</p><h4>How do you envision pulling in or encouraging the private sector to participate?</h4><p>Potential sponsors want exposure and aim to put their budget into something that positively reflects on them. Each year, we have around 3,000 sporting events, which is a great starting point. If demand and visibility of the sports sector increases, the private sector will automatically come in. The private sector wants sustainability and trust, and with our plans we can deliver on these expectations. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the advantages of continuing as an international joint venture?</h4><p>IMEFSCO differs from other corn milling manufacturers through its unique foreign investment, bringing international knowledge and finished products application development and solutions to the region, along with a strong local experience and supply chain infrastructure with its logistical services and bulk solutions. Corn has over 90 product applications and in 2014, we started building our new facility in the same location near Alkharj city (150km from capital Riyadh), investing over SAR600 million to triple corn grind capacity, produce more glucose syrups, and corn sweetener fructose 42, the component that replaces sugar in many food applications. </p><h4>Can you elaborate on your new facility in Al Kharj?</h4><p>After deciding on the investment, both partners and their stakeholders were committed to this major expansion to triple the annual capacity from 120,000 metric tons of corn grind to 350,000 metric tons. As of January 2018, we have successfully started operations, and we aim to serve our existing customers in the region and expand our exports further.</p><h4>What markets and directions does MEFSCO want to focus on?</h4><p>Prior to our expansion, 10% of our sales were exports, mainly to other GCC and Arab countries such as Iraq and Jordan. Our aim now is to grow to 40% exports with a focus on Iraq, Jordan, Yemen, and certain African countries. Being in Saudi Arabia offers us a strong position in terms of using our robust infrastructure. We are close to the ports of Jeddah and Dammam and the cargo flows that go through these port cities. This helps us have a better reach into the MENA region. In our regional markets, we primarily work with distributors or direct sales to manufacturers. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[franchising-done-right]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will you control the quality of the food and brand with this franchise model?</h4><p>Quality is typically the issue for our line of business, and we have a central workshop for recipes where we control the quality. We also have a quality management team that is in charge of the franchise for the first three months. We did this exercise in Egypt when we expanded there, and customers found the same menu, recipe, and taste as in Saudi Arabia. This allows us to relax about going abroad since we have had the experience of doing such a transfer from Saudi.</p><h4>Will you control the specific design of the stores?</h4><p>We will control the design 100% as they will be exact copies of our stores here. No design changes can be made without our approval. We have a corporate manual from a design standpoint that covers everything from electro mechanicals, tiles, standards, the kitchen specs, and everything in terms of the materials required. This will make the job of transferring the design easier.</p><h4>Can you tell us about your store expansions?</h4><p>Our store in Medina opened in 2017, and we have plans in place to open one more in Jeddah, two in Mecca, and another in Khobar, as well as three stores in Riyadh in 2018. We hope to open 11 stores this year, which will increase the total number of Raydan stores to 28, along with seven stores for our sweets catering company.</p><h4>Do you see growth in same-store sales?</h4><p>We are extremely optimistic about the growth of in-store sales and are approaching this through different strategies and tactics to reach double-digit growth during 2018; this is our number-one priority and concern. We have to keep in mind that the takeaway business in Saudi Arabia makes up 75% of the total business, which includes takeaway, drive thru, and home delivery. If we focus on investing on the 25%, that is not the right investment as there is a large CAPEX to bring into stores. Most people focus on the takeaway business because of the changing culture; it is no longer relevant to focus solely on the in-store business.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the rest of 2018?</h4><p>If we increase the number of stores by 50%, revenues will increase by no more than 25% since there is a slowdown in sales in existing stores. In the first quarter, there was a small drop. There will be a recovery in 2H2018 because in the first half the drop came from the imposition of the VAT. Overall, we are continuing our strategy of going ahead to be listed on Tadawul after two years in March 2019. This is a healthy process to prepare the company to go from private to public, especially in such a market that is not as mature as Europe or the US. Overall, we are extremely optimistic about 2018. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us more about your strategic plans for a healthier future?</h4><p>A major part of the medical chapter of Vision 2030 consists of improving public health and preventing disease. Part of this success will be having healthy food, so we want to apply practices from the world's leading countries. We started planning our strategy and came up with a plan to implement it. The WHO has recommended doses of sugar, salt, and saturated and hydrogenated fats for manufacturing, and we want to implement those doses. We want to guide consumers in selecting healthy choices; and to do this, we have aligned ourselves with the Ministry of Education. Furthermore, we have a plan for an initiative for healthy food in public and private corporations. It is our task to support the consumer with the selection of healthy food and with campaigns for healthy lifestyles. For example, we urge restaurants to declare how many calories their items contain. Finally, we are working on lowering the level of pesticides and other contaminants in food to European levels.</p><h4>Under Vision 2030, the government strives for localization in the medical supply industry. How is SFDA working on quality control in this sector?</h4><p>Our target in the drug and medical devices industry is to combine availability, quality, safety, and affordability for consumers and patients alike. We will encourage the increase of local manufacturing to boost the NTP 2020 goal of localizing 40% production. We facilitated and streamlined the process of registration for medications and drugs by 68% in the past year alone. In 2017, the number of registrations increased, and we reduced the time needed to do so. Currently, it is poissble to make an appointment and submit the file within three weeks, and we are committed to give a response within two months, which is much less than the international regulatory authorities. We are also reviewing the quality standards and working with our colleagues in the general authority of aviation in Saudi Arabia and the Ministry of Transport to streamline the introduction of drugs and medical devices in airports and make sure we do not have any hurdles in terms of temperature control in these places. We are also adapting the time we spend on testing in the labs, reducing the number of days from 17 in 2016 to 13. At the same time, the number of staff was reduced by about 20%, and company visitations increased by more than 20%. We are focused on efficiencies and developing our customer service in our business support center, which is located at our headquarters, though we are opening other branches too. It is a layer of customer service not provided by our internal department, but by a department that reports to me directly. We will also have a hotline so people can inquire about anything regarding their file or applications. By establishing centers to help local manufacturers, the latter will also have account managers with whom to follow up with the paperwork. The implementation of VAT in January 2018 exempts drugs and medical devices, which serves manufacturers and consumers well.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[munir-m-al-zu-bi-general-manager-al-wefaq-rent-a-car]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the business advanced in recent years? </h4><p>Al Wefaq Rent a Car was established in 2000 when the market was experiencing significant growth levels; although the car rental market was immature, there were a lot of business opportunities. Some businesses became successful because of their vision and action plans, while others exited the market. In 2010, the owner of Al Wefaq Rent a Car decided to separate the ownership of the company from the management and set KPIs along with short- and long-term goals for the company. The Saudi car rental market is different compared to other countries, especially other GCC countries. In Dubai, more than 90% of the population is made up of expatriates, while here it is the opposite. Most of our clients are locals, and they prefer to deal with local brands, even though there are international companies operating here. The government's introduction of new regulations for the car rental industry has redefined industry practices. The car rental business is not limited to renting cars only; security is another significant concern. Al Wefaq Rent a Car is among the top-five players in the Kingdom and has always focused on providing the best services, offers, and promotions for its valued customers.</p><h4>Al Wefaq Rent a Car has predominantly been a B2C business, are you also increasing your B2B offerings? </h4><p>Al Wefaq corporate leasing and fleet management solutions are renowned in the region. Though Budget and Auto World are big in corporate leasing as they have been in the market for a long time, our quality has enabled us to grab good market share in the B2B market. We operate directly in international cities such as Dubai and Cairo, and we have one franchise in Amman, Jordan. Moreover, we are set to provide franchising rights in Kuwait in the near future. Turkey and Morocco are other potential franchise markets and from there, we might go to Asia Pacific, Europe, and the Americas.</p><h4>What changes are happening to the car rental industry with the new regulations?</h4><p>There are regulations that hit the core of our business and others that affect the surroundings. The regulations that directly affect rental companies force us to integrate our systems with the government systems. For example, we have to authorize and register customers directly through a government platform when we complete the car rental contract with them. Many car rental companies do not have proper processes and IT systems in place. It is expensive, and they do not feel such an investment that adds value to their business. We own a company in Jordan that acts as the in-house development team for our fleet management systems / technologies. Another issue is that the new labor laws that impose fees for foreign employees and require more Saudis on the frontline is an additional costs for businesses, though they help. We were competing with a number of small companies that have significant market share, but due to these regulations they will not be able to survive unless they invest and improve their businesses. This will provide us with an opportunity to capture a greater market share. At the broader level, not just in terms of the transport sector, the government seeks to shift people's approach in Saudi through its reforms. Saudis are traveling and studying abroad more than ever and are gaining a wider experience, which the companies can take benefit from.</p><h4>What are your expectations on the impact of women being allowed to drive on the industry?</h4><p>This offers great potential for us. Saudi women already rent cars from us in places such as Dubai, Cairo, and Oman. They have driving licenses from Bahrain, UAE, the US, and Europe, and we accept all of these. Perhaps for the first few months there might be some challenges, though in time things will change and we will have a new group of clients. Al Wefaq Rent A Car's business is mainly B2C, and we are present in 18 airport locations in Saudi Arabia. Women drivers offer us great potential, though we have to align our products and services that suit women. In other countries, companies would treat male and female clients the same in terms of the service; however, the culture here means companies have to make adjustments to the rental experience. For example, we would have to make sure women do not have to wait in queues or that the car design suits their aesthetic. Certain sectors see this change as a disadvantage because car insurance premiums will go up; however, for us I see it more as an opportunity rather than a problem.</p><h4>Where do you envisage your growth coming from in Saudi over the coming years, and what other plans do you have for Al Wefaq Rent A Car?</h4><p>In previous years, the car rental industry as a whole used to grow with new projects, more employment, local business travelers, and people traveling frequently to visit their families. Things are changing now because people's costs are increasing with new fees, such as VAT, that are coming in. Our prices will increase as well. This means spending behavior is changing. Families used to rent a car for the weekend to drive around, but this may likely change as a result of all the economic changes. Growth within the sector is relatively small. There are several car rental companies that have been operating for 20 or 30 years that are shutting down. This is an opportunity for the companies that are focused and investing wisely to gain a greater share of the existing pie.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the recent trends in the e-commerce market?</h4><p>Traditionally, our express door-to-door business has been there to fulfil the B2B market; however, over the last five years, the introduction of the B2C segment to the Saudi market has resulted in a steady increase in the number of online shoppers. The B2C market has been growing over the last two years and at present it represents 20% of our volume with the growth rate hovering in double digits. DHL is well positioned to fulfill the demands of the Saud market, and the company will continue to adapt its systems according to the market needs. At present, key trade lanes for the B2C market include China, Hong Kong, the US, the UK, Germany, and Italy. The average weight per shipment for the B2C market is around 3kg. An interesting part about this market is that it has created sub industries. For example, there is a growing resellers market in Saudi. From a fulfillment perspective, this has created a number of last-mile companies that are prepared to offer their services to integrators such as DHL, Aramex, FedEx, and UPS. DHL has the biggest international network. We fly twice daily from mainland Asia to Bahrain and have increased the numbers of weekly rotations into Saudi to 22-26 flights. Our couriers are well equipped with smart phones to locate our customers for perfect on time delivery. Equally important, a large number of our couriers are equipped with smart technology to accept credit card payments. One phenomenal achievement by DHL this year is that 80% of its shipments are cleared in the air. It is an achievement that we know leads the express industry in general; so for us to clear over 80% shipments before they actually land in the Kingdom is an achievement that attracts more customers and helps us retain our customers.</p><h4>As a global leader in the sector, how are you implementing smart logistics into the Saudi market?</h4><p>DHL is always the first to invest in the future and new technology to stay ahead of the competition and exceed customer demands. DHL has rolled out mobile apps to provide on-demand delivery, and we are placing special tools to monitor movements through Google maps. We are also working on the development of scanner and optical sources, which increase our productivity. </p><h4>How do you evaluate Saudi Arabia's vision to position itself as the regional logistics hub on the crossroads of three continents?</h4><p>Vision 2030 is one of the most ambiguous visions in the world, and it is very well on track. DHL will continue to invest in Saudi people, driving the Saudization program as well as continue to invest in its infrastructure to support Saudi become a hub for the region. In terms of the bigger picture, the investments that Saudi Arabia is making in infrastructure will provide great connectivity amongst all the major towns and cities; however, more work needs to be done on port as they need to be better equipped to handle larger volumes.</p><h4>What are your primary ambitions for the coming year? </h4><p>Our primary ambitions for the coming years is to continue delivering our customers' needs and drive the Saudization program to ensure that we are training and developing the future of our business. Also, plans are in place to further invest in our fleet, infrastructure, and technology, and continue to grow our B2B. Saudi Arabia is a key market for our network; we have existed here for 40 years and we look forward to the next 40 years and beyond. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the business advanced in recent years? </h4><p>Al Wefaq Rent a Car was established in 2000 when the market was experiencing significant growth levels; although the car rental market was immature, there were a lot of business opportunities. Some businesses became successful because of their vision and action plans, while others exited the market. In 2010, the owner of Al Wefaq Rent a Car decided to separate the ownership of the company from the management and set KPIs along with short- and long-term goals for the company. Due to the high potential in the market, several international players showed interest and approached us to represent them in Saudi; we decided to represent Dollar Rent a Car and continue to hold their franchise. The Saudi car rental market is different compared to other countries, especially other GCC countries. In Dubai, more than 90% of the population is made up of expatriates, while here it is the opposite. Most of our clients are locals, and they prefer to deal with local brands, even though there are international companies operating here. The government's introduction of new regulations for the car rental industry has redefined industry practices. The car rental business is not limited to renting cars only; security is another significant concern. Al Wefaq Rent a Car is among the top-five players in the Kingdom and has always focused on providing the best services, offers, and promotions for its valued customers. </p><h4>Al Wefaq Rent a Car has predominantly been a B2C business. With your arrangement with Dollar, are you also increasing your B2B offerings?</h4><p>Al Wefaq corporate leasing and fleet management solutions are renowned in the region. Though Budget and Auto World are big in corporate leasing as they have been in the market for a long time, our quality has enabled us to grab good market share in the B2B market. We do not have any plans to change the Al Wefaq Rent A Car brand to Dollar as we have already started signing franchise agreement for Al Wefaq Rent a Car trademark. We operate directly in international cities such as Dubai and Cairo, and we have one franchise in Amman, Jordan. Moreover, we are set to provide franchising rights in Kuwait in the near future. Turkey and Morocco are other potential franchise markets and from there, we might go to Asia Pacific, Europe, and the Americas.</p><h4>What are your expectations of the impact of women being allowed to drive on the industry?</h4><p>This offers great potential for us. Saudi women already rent cars from us in places such as Dubai, Cairo, and Oman. They have driving licenses from Bahrain, the UAE, the US, and Europe. Perhaps for the first few months, there will be some challenges, but things will change and we will have a new group of clients. Al Wefaq Rent A Car's business is mainly B2C, and we are present in 18 airport locations in Saudi Arabia. Women drivers offer us great potential, but we have to align our products services to suit women. Certain sectors see this change as a disadvantage because car insurance premiums will go up; however, we see it as an opportunity.</p><h4>Where do you envisage your growth over the coming years, and what are your future plans?</h4><p>In previous years, the car rental industry as a whole used to grow with new projects, more employment, local business travelers, and people traveling frequently to visit their families. Things are changing now because people's costs are increasing with new regulations such as VAT. Therefore, growth within the sector is relatively small. Several car rental companies that have been operating for 20 or 30 years are shutting down, and this is an opportunity for the companies that are focused and investing wisely to gain a greater share of the existing pie. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Where does the Riyadh Metro project stand today?</h4><p>Around the world, there is currently no project of this magnitude and ambition that is performing better from a cost, technology, and integration perspective. Any project of this magnitude will have immense challenges with the public interface, and with changing the culture of travel. There is no established history of bringing six urban metro lines into service on this kind of scale. Challenges for all parties continue to increase, making the milestones more significant. Therefore, it is extremely critical that all parties work together to achieve the best outcome. The project remains a symbol of transformation, an anchor of Vision 2030 that is visible and accessible to millions of people; it will certainly be a recognizable attribute of Riyadh itself. This will be the 19th-largest transport network in the world, and notably, the entire network will be implemented simultaneously. All trains for the BACS package are now manufactured and ready to go. We are testing, running, and maintaining the trains in Europe today as we have full testing facilities in Europe. Moreover, the first trains for BACS have arrived in Riyadh and the testing has started on site.</p><h4>What are the main challenges before the trains start running in 2019?</h4><p>The next period consists of testing and commissioning to see the trains running on the infrastructure. The entire integration requires three consortiums working together with Arriyadh Development Authority (ADA). During first three years all the construction was underground, but now the work is fully visible to the public; ADA should be proud of what has been accomplished. The big iconic stations, bridges, and train depots are all nearing completion. The Riyadh metro iconic station at King Abdullah Financial District (KAFD) is becoming integrated with the revitalization of KAFD, which is envisioned to become an iconic architectural symbol of the metro; the station there would help revitalize that project. Some of the other major existing facilities serviced by the metro also come into play. Government facilities, King Saud University, and King Fahd stadium are ready to reap the benefits of the system. The metro's success has people of Riyadh excited about the next steps and the evolution of the public transport. The integration of the bus feeder system has gone well, which is an integral part of giving people access to the system so they can generally go from their neighborhood to where they need to go without using a private vehicle.</p><h4>What innovative solutions are you implementing?</h4><p>This metro system has a state-of-the-art driverless radio technology-based system. One of the advantages of building this all at the same time is that all trains in the system will operate under the Unattended Train Operation (UTO). Whereas, for other systems that were built over time, it is more complicated to start with such an integrated foundation. By building all the lines at the same time, ADA has created an impressive integrated network of the highest standards. All the consortiums have used leading innovation from a construction and a building technology perspective, whether that is modeling with different laser technologies or the latest in engineering and equipment technologies. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was envisioned with the company's rebranding as BATIC, and how has your service portfolio expanded since then?</h4><p>The rebranding of Mubarrad to BATIC was orchestrated to correctly reflect the expansion of the core assets of the company that now reach beyond logistics and delve into security, while also highlighting the newly found focus of BATIC on investments and acquisitions. Within the logistics domain, BATIC has expanded its offering, and in 2018, the firm closed a transaction pending regulatory approval for two sets of assets. The first set includes warehouses in Dammam and Riyadh and a trucking fleet from Muhaidib Group, and the second set is one of the largest cold chain warehousing networks in the Kingdom from Dar Al Abbar. Combined with the recent minority investment into Trukkin, an innovative trucking platform, BATIC's services will now include 3PL, cold storage, cold transport, warehousing, and trucking marketplaces. In security, the firm is primarily focused on private security for banks, such as cash in transit and ATM management. Our offshoot AMNCO was renowned for exploring and accelerating into facilities management and electronic payments but BATIC has now acquired full ownership of those segments as well.</p><h4>Could you tell us more about your vision for using advanced technology in your sector?</h4><p>We use GPS technology and fleet management systems on all of our trucks. Moreover, BATIC will capitalize on our stake in Trukkin, a company which operates a B2B ground transport platform similar to Uber for the trucking industry. The system matches available truck capacity and drivers with demand from operators.</p><h4>Vision 2030 envisions to capitalize on the Kingdom's strategic location between Europe, Asia, and Africa to develop the country into a logistic hub. As one of the leading Saudi logistics firms, what are your expectations here? </h4><p>BATIC is actively exploring logistics hubs on the Red Sea to support Vision 2030 and to interact with countries on the eastern seaboard of Africa. Also, Iraq, which is accessible via ground transport, presents a growing opportunity for Saudi Arabia, and BATIC is currently pursuing several options focused on this new geographic opportunity.</p><h4>How are you looking to expand your Kingdom-wide network and your activities in the GCC region?</h4><p>Through the acquisition of Dar Al Abbar, BATIC will gain warehousing capabilities in every major city in Saudi Arabia. Combined with the premium warehousing assets of Al Himmah logistics (owned by Muhaidib Group) in Riyadh and Dammam, this transaction will leave BATIC well positioned to gain market share on existing ground transport services and cold chain storage in the coming years.</p><h4>What are your primary ambitions for the years ahead?</h4><p>BATIC's primary initiative is to become the leading logistics consolidator in Saudi Arabia. After closing nearly SAR500-million worth of transactions this year, the current focal point is to successfully integrate all of the recent acquisitions in a cohesive manner while sustaining the drive for expansion in both cold storage and the offerings of AMNCO in cash logistics. The firm's comprehensive approach looks to stay ahead of the prevailing technological trends in logistics and security by identifying long-term growth potential in specialized segments that grow faster than the overall market. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the company performed in 2018 so far, and what have been the major developments?</h4><p>The major development for us in 2018 was our strategy deployment and transformation. We kicked off our transformation journey to become a regional leader by providing world-class services, which is our new redefined vision, and started delivering on the strategy we promised. With a stronger financial situation and clarity in our operational focus, we started the journey of excellence. We have a clear plan and strategic initiatives in place with a key focus on five pillars: safe operations, efficient operations, human capital development, financial effectiveness, and strategic partnership building. In 2018, we are focusing more on safety and reliability and adding the human factor. In addition, our financial situation is solid, and we are focusing on being more effective to support and grow our business. We reach out to our customers and receive feedback on how to improve, because one of our strategic objectives is regarding customer engagement. Airlines have high expectations from us, and we should be able to meet them. We do not just want to operate, but also elevate our operations to a standard that meets our regulatory requirements and satisfies our customers.</p><h4>How will you carry out your new strategy?</h4><p>The new strategy is a three-year plan. In 2018, the first year, the focus was on operational standardization and strengthening the foundations, starting with putting in place a strong safety system and culture. Then we identified our infrastructure requirements, including surveillance and communication systems, that need to be upgraded to the latest technology, followed by ensuring our employees have the best-in-class development and working conditions. We see 2018 as the operations standardization year, while 2019 will be about optimization and control and 2020 is to ensure sustainability and innovation. It is critical that our operation systems are at optimum standards. For this, we signed a SAR100-million contract with INDRA to replace the overall ATM navigation system. Implementation is already in place; the Abha region has been completed, and we plan to have it fully operational by early 2020. In addition, multiple contracts have been signed to upgrade and replace our navigation surveillance and voice communication systems across the country.</p><h4>What investment is needed in Saudi Arabia to ensure the safe and efficient flow of air traffic?</h4><p>We have to define where we are and where we want to be. Second, we need to have a strong and agreed operation plan among the industry stakeholders in order to manage complexity and support growth. In our case, we are investing in technology and people, which are the concrete pillars for operations. We also have a project at SANS under government supervision called Saudi Future Airspace Capacity that will define how the airspace in Saudi Arabia will look in 20 years based on several variables and future requirements, so we have a clear investment and growth plan in place.</p><h4>How can foreign investors contribute to the development of the aviation sector?</h4><p>Saudi Arabia is a great place for future investors thanks to Vision 2030, and specifically in the aviation industry where all key players are transforming to meet our great vision and ambitions. There are big players in the navigation sectors market that are already a partner or will partner with local players for investment. And with our Saudization plan and local added value, these companies are partnering with us and offering the latest technology, all aligned with future plans. We are working with different industry leaders to bring the latest technology and systems to Saudi Arabia. For example, we are partnering with INDRA to support air navigation technical service as well as other potential business areas such as synchronized operation services in airports through collaboration systems. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does Saudi Arabia play for the entire business portfolio of TAV Airports?</h4><p>Medina Airport is the only airport in Saudi Arabia that is currently under operation of TAV Airports. In 2017, we won the tender for three additional airports in the Kingdom—Yanbu, Qassim, and Hail. We have signed the agreements, though we are waiting for the final go-ahead from the General Authority for Civil Aviation (GACA). The Kingdom is extremely important for us; therefore, with our partners, Al Rajhi Group, we have established PAN Airports Holding Group. This is the first private airport operations company in the Kingdom, and it will be handling operations of Medina Airport and the other three airports awaiting government approval. We will also have companies under the holding providing services such as duty free, F&amp;B, and ground handling. Our main aim is to continue to invest in Saudi Arabia and the region in both airports and service companies, though our growth is not just limited to such inorganic growth. Organic growth is also an important part of our growth strategy. For example, when we started our operations in Medina Airport, the number of passengers per annum was 4 million compared to 8 million in recent years. Passenger numbers are extremely important because 1,000 direct jobs at the airport and another 1,000 in the city are created for every 1 million passengers. Our service companies bring high-quality services to Medina Airport, and we hope to do the same at other airports in Saudi Arabia. In addition, our IT support company, TAV Technologies, operates the IT systems for Medina and Dammam airports, which also adds significant value to the aviation industry in the country.</p><h4>How does TAV Airports take advantage of the goals set out in Vision 2030 for the transportation sector?</h4><p>Vision 2030 is extremely important, which is why we have positioned ourselves in line with it and established PAN Airports Holding Group. Privatization and infrastructure implementation are key for Saudi Arabia's further economic growth. The Kingdom's 2030 Vision opens doors for FDI and international trade. The country needs more roads, airports, and ports, and we can participate in this growth as an international airport operator and investor.</p><h4>How does TAV Airports integrate with other airport operators worldwide?</h4><p>It is about knowledge. The airport business is a sophisticated, international industry, and one has to know the business internationally. For example, 46% of TAV Airports holdings in Turkey belong to Aéroports de Paris (ADP), and we are partners with Fraport AG at Antalya Airport. In addition, VINCI Airports, which is another large airport operator in Europe, partners with ADP. In turn, ADP partners with the Schiphol Group. Therefore, when we look at these relationships, we are currently represented in one of the largest airport platforms in the world. With these operators, we handle 500 million passengers per year. TAV itself handles 150 million passengers.</p><h4>What are your main plans and expectations in Saudi Arabia for the coming year?</h4><p>We are extremely optimistic and excited for the future of Saudi Arabia under Vision 2030. Once we receive approval from GACA, we will immediately start to invest USD400 million in the three airports. We have already raised the required financing and are ready to go. Our other investment plans are for the terminal buildings because we want to add more passenger capacity to Saudi Arabia. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are Saudia Cargo's main strengths?</h4><p>Saudia Cargo ranks among the world's leading airfreight carriers, and has left an indelible mark on the Middle East as it was the first to venture into this industry. We are uniquely positioned to provide a bridge between East and West via a wide global network and our three main hubs in Saudi Arabia. This gives us a unique competitive edge with increased flexibility, allowing us to move cargo with minimal handling time. We are currently undergoing an organizational transformation. Our strategy is in support of the Kingdom's Vision 2030 to make Saudi Arabia a leading freight and logistics hub for the region by leveraging its geographical location. In line with that, my aim is to focus on our five strategic pillars: safety and security, service quality, people, customer experience, and profitable growth.</p><h4>The flip side to privatization across the industry has been the loosening of regulations and the introduction of foreign competitors. Is this market disruption healthy for the industry?</h4><p>Competition is inevitable in an open market. We view it as motivation to become better in what we do and provide better service to our customers. According to a Boeing analysis, in the coming 20 years, world air cargo traffic will grow 4.2% annually. Overall, world air cargo traffic will increase from 223 billion revenue ton kilometers (RTK) in 2015 to 509 billion RTK in 2035. As far as Saudia Cargo is concerned, our strategy under 2020 initiative will make us more than ready to take on global competition.</p><h4>Technology has been driving the goals of Vision 2030 across the economy. How is Saudia Cargo adopting technological solutions to further its goals?</h4><p>Technology enables transparency and makes transactions faster in different industries. The airfreight industry benefits significantly from this, as customers are able to track shipments in real time. At the same time, it makes booking easier and faster. This is transparency at its best, and we intend to invest further in our IT infrastructure for the benefit of our customers. Saudia Cargo is digitalizing to enhance its customer experience. The world has become smaller, and it is now heavily dependent on technology. Whether we like it or not, the digital age will catch up with the airfreight industry. The fourth industrial revolution, generally known as Industry 4.0, is already here, and the earlier we embrace technological advancements, the better.</p><h4>What are some of your goals and ambitions for 2018 and in the longer term?</h4><p>My goals include transformation by 2020 that will eventually cater to Vision 2030. I focus on investing in our IT capabilities, people, machinery/equipment, and facilities. Saudia Cargo is heavily investing in infrastructural development. We have signed agreements with three major companies to construct a new cargo handling facility with a total investment of SAR1.4 billion (USD373.5 million) for both Jeddah and Riyadh. The current 35,000-sqm facility at Jeddah's King Abdul Aziz International Airport (KAIA) will be upgraded to a 75,000-sqm, state-of-the-art cargo handling facility with special focus on cold chain, pharmaceutical, and dangerous goods handling. The first phase of the project will start in September 2018 and is expected to end in November 2019, while the second phase will begin in June 2020 and is projected to end by December 2021. Riyadh's King Khalid International Airport facility will be fully refurbished in phases to buid a new 23,600-sqm unit with special focus on e-commerce and special handling. In 2018, we also inaugurated the cold storage facility for medical and pharmaceutical products at KAIA Cargo Terminal to meet the increasing demand for temperature-controlled shipments. The refrigerated warehouse was opened in conjunction with the launch of FlyPharma, a product designed specifically to meet the growing demand for the pharmaceutical and life sciences sector. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[180 Stores Throughout Ecuador]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[gustavo-wray-general-manager-agripac]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Agripac has significantly increased its presence in the country. Could you tell us more about the company's advancement in recent years?</h4><p>Agripac's new strategy is to go directly to end customers—farmers, shrimp producers, growers, and so on. Most of our growth has come from our own store's retail chain. In 2018 we have opened five new stores reaching a total of 180 stores throughout the country at the end of the year. In middle-sized cities like Quevedo and Machala, we are building larger stores and warehouses to provide farmers with our whole range of products like seeds, fertilizers, herbicides, fungicides and insecticides. In addition to our traditional products like shrimp feeds, chicken feeds, and cattle feeds, we have our own brands of dog and cat food: Buen Can and NutraPro which is a Premium brand. Both are produced in Ecuador and compete against imported products of multinationals. Nowadays, we are expanding our capacity with state of the art machinery to assure the quality and growth of our pet food line. In our agricultural division, we have a strong supply line for the production of maize, potatoes, vegetables, and flowers in the Highlands. For maize, especially, we have a program called “Maize Plan," where we provide producers with all their supplies—seeds, fertilizers, and chemicals. They plant and grow their maize, and after five months, they repay us with their harvest. Their production comes back to us as raw material for chicken feed, which consists of 50-60% maize. This way, we encourage a full production cycle.</p><h4>What other products do you produce locally, and which products are imported?</h4><p>Local products make up around 30-40% of our total sales, while the rest is imported. All our animal feeds are produced locally. Our factory for agrochemicals is located in Ecuador, from which we export to Peru and Colombia. Agripac shifted from being an import company 47 years ago to an agro-industrial company with its own factories and distribution channels. Currently, we have stores in the jungle as far as Lago Agrio to support the local maize industry as well as in the Highlands and the Coast—all stocked via our own logistics operations. We have developed a domestic supply chain for farmers and shrimp growers. We are primarily focused on Ecuador, though we predict to export to neighboring countries to grow through natural expansion. Five years ago, we had total annual sales of USD200 million, which has grown to an expected USD300 million for 2018.</p><h4>How have you incorporated sustainability and social responsibility in your company's philosophy?</h4><p>We take different actions in Social Responsibility. One of our programs is “La Escuelita," where we recruit recent graduates in agriculture for on-the-job training. We also provide free technical training to farmers to maximize their harvests. Currently, we are working on a project to develop online training programs for our farmers. Furthermore, we support local governments when they want to develop small farming projects in their regions. In terms of environment sustainability, we have launched a product line of organic products for the banana sector. With AeroAgripac, we are perhaps the only certified company that offers aero fumigation with a certified organic plane for organic plantations. Five years ago, we launched a dedicated committee for CSR, which has evolved into a focus group for sustainability. In coordination with the Ministry of Agriculture, we participated in a program called “Plan Semilla," which supports small farmers to grow their maize, rice, and other crops, providing them with seeds, fertilizers, and training to improve their productivity. The local Association of Agriculture supplies (APCSA) is now approaching the new minister to propose something similar, as collaboration between the public, private sectors and academia is very important for the development of our society. These programs should be transparent and provide real support to farmers.</p><h4>How do you approach product development and innovation?</h4><p>Ecuadorian companies in general do not invest much in research and development. In our case we are increasing our investment on this area through the development of the first Research Center for shrimp supplies in Ecuador; we have scientists from Europe working with us as well as Ecuadorean PHD experts.</p><h4>How do you envision the agro- and aquaculture sector developing, and what does that mean for Agripac?</h4><p>In the agriculture sector, products like maize, rice, palm and cocoa will continue developing; one of our advantages is that we count with the highest international quality standards for these traditional crops. Moreover, I believe that we should continue developing closer relations with international markets in order to know their needs and provide other agriculture products like exotic and tropical fruits. For example the global market for chocolate is demanding higher percentages of cocoa so we should take that opportunity. The aquaculture sector is still growing although its demand slowed down slightly during 2017 after an aggressive growth for seven years. We are permanently innovating and creating solutions for this sector in order to take new opportunities to grow.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[an-empire-built-from-scratch]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the highlights of the past year for SGS?</h4><p>For SGS, 2017 was a special year. We began an extremely ambitious transformation plan to achieve certain KPIs. We have revamped our entire strategy in a process that involved all stakeholders. Today, we are present in 27 airports in the Kingdom and want to have a presence in every new airport. We are working to expand beyond the definition of ground handling to become a services company that provides ground handling, ticketing, passenger services, hotel transfers, and related hospitality services. In the past year, SGS' on-time performance has improved by more than 26% while customer complaints fell by 24%.<br> </p><h4>How has the recent liberalization of the industry affected your business?</h4><p>Living without standards or competitors leads to inefficient operations. Competition brings greater vitality to the sector and gives us the energy to enhance our operations, standards, and perspectives. While prices have fallen across the industry, we are not a price-driven organization, and if someone seeks a service based solely on price, then they will not approach us. We provide an integrated service from A to Z, which includes managing the difficult environment. We offer firms the ability to maximize operations across a wide variety of areas. Our clients require experienced account providers, and, as market leaders, this is the role we play. We are an agent that allows our clients, such as airlines, to maximize the efficiency of their operations. Our competitors, on the other hand, undercut our prices by offering more restricted services.<br> </p><h4>Do you expect to benefit from the new airport in Jeddah, and how do you plan to capitalize on this project?</h4><p>We are eagerly anticipating the airport's impending opening. We did a great deal of work to partner with the airport authority and airlines to make sure we are responsive in this new environment. We want to deliver comparable or even superior levels of service in this new airport. Another element has been determining how we can maximize our own operations and revenue in this new space. There will be fewer buses in the new airport, for example, which is a service that generates significant revenue at the current airport. However, we will expand our special needs services in the new airport, which will tie into the increased number of Hajj and Umrah visitors. On that subject, we have launched a concept called Road to Mecca to assist religious visitors who often get stuck in Jeddah; our aim is to minimize the traffic in Jeddah by transporting passengers directly to Mecca. For example, we are building a luggage center in Mecca so passengers do not have to check in at Jeddah Airport. In combination with the opening of the new Jeddah Airport, all this will make the growth in the number of pilgrim visitors smooth and easy.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the market in 2018?</h4><p>2018 will be defined by a great deal of transformation. Transformation on a company level begins with close analysis of financial statements with an eye on maximizing operations. In many transformations, the first year of change is the worst in terms of financial results. After the first year, the financial results fall in line with expectations. Technology is a vital enabler of this business, and we must work to ensure that we position ourselves in a way that maximizes our current and future prospects. This year, we want to collaborate and share information with the General Authority of Civil Aviation (GACA) and various other stakeholders. Another key pillar is people; we hired our first female employee in December 2017 and aim to have 500 women working by end-2018. This is all part of rebuilding the company in line with our KPIs and objectives, which have been shaped by the larger reform agenda at work in the Kingdom. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you envision the railway project moving forward in 2018?</h4><p>By the end of 2018, our aim is to consolidate all operations in the railway project under one sole entity. This will be possible once a merger between the Saudi Railway Organization, a government organization, and the Saudi Railway Company, a government-owned company, is finalized to ensure all work is completed on time and efficiently. In addition, we will also seek participation from the private sector in key segments of the railway, specifically for links between the Dammam-Riyadh line with the North-South Railway. We will also seek participation for the construction of the Land Bridge, which will connect the west coast of the country with the east coast. </p><h4>How are you bringing about operational changes to the Ministry of Transport?</h4><p>The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is undergoing rapid changes, and already, we have begun making the necessary changes to ensure government operations run smoothly. Take the example of the Saudi Port Authority, which has undergone fundamental paradigm shifts in how the ports operate, the type of equipment that is being used, and most importantly, the introduction of digital tools to aid in workflow processes and procedures. By digitizing most of our processes within ports, customs, and other government agencies, we have been able to reduce processing time from 12 to five days, with the aim of going down to three days by the end of 2018.</p><h4>Vision 2030 has created a transformation agenda for the country to diversify its economy and make it an instrumental logistics hub across Europe, Asia, and Africa. What role do you envision for the Ministry of Transport in directing this process and developing the necessary infrastructure?</h4><p>The Ministry of Transport sees two key projects that will be important in achieving the Kingdom's Vision 2030. The first is to turn Saudi Arabia into a logistics hub that connects three continents. The second one is to reiterate that we are the center of the Islamic world, while also enhancing the Hajj and Umrah experience for pilgrims visiting the two holy sites. This focus has been a core element in the major infrastructure projects that are about to be completed, including the King Abdulaziz Airport in Jeddah and the Haramain High-Speed Railway. These projects are not only aimed at enhancing our country but also welcoming tourists, as well as pilgrims visiting the two Holy Mosques. We have thus achieved a great deal in terms of increasing the efficiencies of our logistics platforms and are looking to the future for new infrastructure projects to ultimately achieve the vision of our nation. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the scope of your operations advanced in recent years? </h4><p>BAE Systems has been working in partnership with Saudi Arabia for over 50 years. Developing Saudi industry, recruiting Saudi Nationals, and transferring technology and capability into Saudi Arabia is the core of our strategy. The recent introduction of Vision 2030 has articulated our strategy clearly and strengthened our resolve. BAES SA is a Saudi company with approximately 7,000 employees in KSA, 72% of which are Saudi nationals. Furthermore, half of BAES SA's board members are Saudi Nationals. We have established comprehensive systems intended to support the transfer of knowledge and technology to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, whilst also supporting the long-term development of our Saudi employees. As part of this, we have a number of in-Kingdom partner companies including BAE Systems Saudi Development and Training, International Systems Engineering, Aircraft Accessories and Components Company, Saudi Maintenance Supply Chain Management Company, and Advance Electronic Company.</p><h4>With the current administration's plans for localization, do you anticipate any changes to BAES SA?</h4><p>We have ambitious plans to continue to expand our presence here. We have just started setting the facilities for the assembly of military fast jets, something that has never been done before in Saudi Arabia. The first major components have been delivered and assembly has commenced. To support this, we have Saudi nationals in training and gaining the experience of working on the production of these aircraft. In addition, much of the equipment that we put onto these facilities has been manufactured in Saudi Arabia, so it will be a proud moment when the first fast jet aircraft made in Saudi Arabia flies out of our facility. We are making a considerable investment, and looking forward we would like to establish joint ventures with the Saudi Government and the Saudi Arabian Military Industries (SAMI). Our activity here supports the strategy articulated by SAMI extremely well in creating jobs, transferring technology, and training Saudi nationals to create innovative and modern products.<br>How can global firms like BAE Systems play a role in Saudi Arabia's goal to become a knowledge-based economy?<br>We are extremely proud of our graduate scheme, which provides focus training and work experience and prepares fresh graduates to become leaders of the future. We also provide many apprenticeships and on-the-job training, which is about giving people craft rather than academic skills. To enable them to physically do work in maintaining aircraft and supporting high-technology equipment is of utmost importance. We have great products and opportunities for people with inquiring minds. For those who are innovative and enjoy engineering and technology, we have the best high technology products to work on across our operations</p><h4>Can the Kingdom also become a center for product development on innovation for BAE Systems?</h4><p>We are already working on this and have joint ventures with a number of KAS research institutes, including King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology. We provide sponsorship and send our engineers and other employees to give lectures to share our work and technology. Under our university collaboration program, we have relationships with a number of universities around the country. Collaboration with the academic world takes place not only in the Kingdom, but also via our strong ties with British and American universities.</p><h4>What would you outline as your main objectives and ambitions?</h4><p>For 50 years, our work carried out in the Kingdom has played a crucial part in supporting the country's national objectives and helping to maintain its security. Today, we look to build upon our proud heritage and enjoy new successes through our partnership with Saudi Arabia. We are focussed on the goals of Vision 2030 and working together with the Saudi Government to create a strong sovereign defence industry. The Vision 2030 goal of Saudi Arabia becoming the hub that connects Europe, Asia, and Africa reflects our ambitions; our goal is for Saudi Arabia to become BAE Systems' regional hub from where we can service our global clientele. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the latest developments at Defense Enterprises?</h4><p>We started building two factories in Al Kharj, which are both almost ready for production. The machines are from Europe and have been installed, so production can start in mid-2018. The setup follows the industrial model, and we are arranging everything with our main clients, the Ministry of Defense, and the Ministry of Interior. Currently, there is no Saudi manufacturer of these products. In addition, the government wants to localize production, and we are well positioned to take this step forward. Defense Enterprises emerged as a private initiative, and we have a technology transfer partnership with a company from the Netherlands. In the first three years of production, we will still develop our production facilities; however, after five years we will be able to cover the entire demand of the Saudi market.</p><h4>Can you source all your material locally?</h4><p>All the materials come from Saudi Arabia. The polyethylene is entirely manufactured here and is then exported to other companies to produce different products. Such production needs large investments, and fortunately we have Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC). The composite material we make here is the main material used on the market. It is sourced locally so we utilize our natural wealth.</p><h4>Are you looking to export eventually?</h4><p>Yes, we are open to the regional market and even have clients in Arab countries, such as Egypt and Libya. In the future, we can start exporting to Europe and the US. We have a contract with a lab in the US that specializes in testing and certifying body armor. Once we receive the certificate, we can sell our products anywhere. When we are ready, the profit margin for production here will allow us to be extremely competitive in the global market. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Saudi administration has set comprehensive targets for localization for the defensive and aviation industries. How do you envision SAMI's role here?</h4><p>Working under the directives outlined in the Vision 2030 blueprint, SAMI plays a key role in localizing the total government military spending in Saudi Arabia, increasing domestic procurement to 50% by 2030 to be among the top 25 military industry companies in the world. We are keen to achieve this by making SAMI a turning point in the development of Saudi military industries, with targets such as a direct contribution of around SAR14 billion (USD3.7 billion) to the Kingdom's GDP, an investment of over SAR6 billion (USD1.6 billion) on R&amp;D to ensure complete alignment with the latest industry trends and advancements, and the creation of 40,000 direct jobs for Saudis.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on your involvement across aeronautics and land systems, including military vehicles and defense electronics?</h4><p>SAMI currently focuses its investment on the development of new technologies and manufacturing of products and provides services across four business divisions. These are aeronautics, which includes aircraft, combat rotorcrafts, transport aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and aerostructures; land systems, which includes wheeled and tracked armored vehicles, logistics vehicles, turret systems, protection systems, and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs); weapons and missiles, which includes missiles and guided weapons, launchers, conventional weapons/guns, and ammunition; and defense electronics, which includes radar and microwave, optoelectronics, communication systems, electronic warfare, C4I, cyber warfare, and naval combat systems. In addition, we are currently leading Saudi Arabia's efforts to develop self-sufficient defense capabilities through the establishment of a sustainable military industries sector, covering the full value chain  across our four business divisions. We will also heavily invest in new technologies in cooperation with local universities and R&amp;D centers.</p><h4>How do you envision fostering relations with multinationals and global knowledge hubs for local capacity building?</h4><p>At SAMI, we pride ourselves on our team, which includes specialized and experienced professionals who work together and put forth their best efforts to ensure the company's success, excellence, and achievement of its vision and objectives. This is coupled with the latest technologies in the field of military industries. At the same time, we have been extremely successful thus far in attracting leading international companies in this sector to transfer their expertise, knowledge, and technologies to the Kingdom to benefit from enriching our operations, achieving our strategic objectives, and reflecting our vision for the future. We combine the latest technologies and the best national talent to develop military products and services on par with international standards and achieve the Kingdom's self-sufficiency in military industries. So far, we have signed MoUs and MoAs with renowned military companies such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing, BAE Systems, Raytheon, General Dynamics, MBDA, Thales, and Navantia to produce world-class weapons systems and support the growth and development of its four business divisions. All these agreements will help SAMI establish itself as a leading military manufacturer in the region. On top of this, SAMI aspires to be an enabler to the local military manufacturing industry, as it will pass on its knowledge and expertise to other military industries in the Kingdom.</p><h4>What are your primary ambitions for the years ahead?</h4><p>In the near future, SAMI will roll out its joint ventures and build up all required manufacturing and service capacities. At the same time, we will set up engineering competence centers and invest in cutting-edge technologies to design our indigenous products. SAMI will provide the Kingdom's main military needs in the future and benefit from existing capabilities within the military industry, which we are going to integrate. This will allow us to build up a robust military industry sector in the Kingdom. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your vision for the recently opened first public cloud data center in the Kingdom?</h4><p>This is part of our commitment to Vision 2030, and the digital hub was an initiative to enable the digital transformation across the public and private sectors. There are four components to the digital hub, and the data center is the core of it. Already, we have connected a government entity, which will help speed up and expedite transformation across different government entities. One of the most important elements of the government's transformation is continuous change, and the government continues to develop its regulation to make the business transformation work. With our support for the digital transformation, the regulatory changes will be implemented more smoothly. For us, it is extremely important to have a solid infrastructure for digital transformation on the ground that is tailored and designed to follow and support the transformation.</p><h4>Have you seen a strong understanding from the government to discuss with the private sector the regulations that are needed?</h4><p>When a ministry wants to privatize part of its operations, it will focus on the regulations and find a private party to outsource its services to. This, then, completely changes the operating model, and it now only regulates, monitors, and supervises, while there are KPIs with the private contractor. With such transformations, a localization partner such as SAP will run the process engineering and ensure a smooth and fair transition. For us, such policy changes are just upgrades to a live system, with the government as main issuer. Great localization is embedded and is part of the investment in a digital partner. For SAP, it is a major investment, and we need tailor-made solutions for our clients.</p><h4>What IT services can be provided to guide the digital transformation in healthcare?</h4><p>Healthcare is among the 25 industries we are focused on, and we are progressing well. Some programs are pure operations, some are on an outsourcing model, and others are quality and analytics focused. Our challenge is to connect all outcomes to one platform. It is great for the healthcare ecosystem to turn digital, especially because there is a great deal of in-house development in the sector. In any industry, if there is a great deal of in-house movement, it lacks the capabilities and strength that helps the industry to transform. In such a context, SAP can develop a common strategy. For healthcare, we have a core system enabling operations and strategy called H.I.S. support hospitals with their patient interactions. We work with the Ministry of Health on this, coordinating the outsourcing of certain operations to the private sector and to meet their KPIs. This is certain among the most interesting and comprehensive industries to work with for us.</p><h4>What expertise does SAP bring to the Kingdom to accelerate IoT services?</h4><p>SAP works with anything related to resources to optimize the actualization of these resources to make them more available. Whether they are natural resources, people, or machines, the entire idea of IoT is using sensors and other tools to improve interaction between humans and machines, react on the basis of the data, and provide better services to citizens. Secondly, these solutions help to improve security, manage traffic, and coordinate city maintenance. In Saudi, we have done a small version with regards to traffic estimation. Such a system can function as a smart hub for city governments, while also providing commercial value to the private sector. Insurance companies can look into road safety and optimize their services. Building a smart city is a process, and one cannot go fully digital overnight. It starts with putting in place the right infrastructure and applications and then implementing the intended solutions. The traffic project has been live for two years, and we now have multiple projects in the pipeline with the city authorities of Riyadh.</p><h4>How are you working with young graduates and getting them excited to work in IT?</h4><p>In 2012, we began building the ecosystem of partners and local talent to work with advanced technology to support customers and government. To date, we have trained more than 400,000 students. With our YP program, we continue to graduate every quarter for the last five years. These graduates have moved on for many different companies and organizations. With SAP Saudi Arabia, we have a 50/50 male-female team, and we employ 40% Saudis. Around 37% of our staff is under the age of 30. We recently appointed the first female Saudi manager, which we were extremely pleased with in a globally male-dominated industry. We work with 28 university partners, and we have two academies ourselves for talent development. In the future, we aim to develop more training centers, especially to deliver short courses.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have your operations advanced throughout the years?</h4><p>Luberef is a joint venture between Saudi Aramco and Jadwa Industrial Investment and started producing and supplying base oil in 1978, celebrating its 40th year in operations in 2018. Since its inception, Luberef has sought to be a company that seeks innovation and growth, produce high-quality products, and be a leader in the market. Thus far, we have grown from one to two refineries—in Jeddah and Yanbu—with a major expansion at the Yanbu refinery in 2018 that doubled the size of the total production of base oil to around 8 million barrels per year. Following the Yanbu expansion, Luberef has become a substantial market player in the industry and supply side influencer, with a production volume that represents about 40% of Middle East production capacity.</p><h4>How do you approach diversification and innovation?</h4><p>The recent Yanbu expansion was not just about volume; it introduced a modern production technology that makes new types of higher performance base oil products—Group II base oils. With the expansion, Luberef is the first producer to offer a full range of Group II base oils within the Middle East region, and as such is taking a leading role in facilitating a change in the market that enables and supports the market drive to provide higher quality lubricants. Luberef has developed into a global company, moving from supplying the GCC to markets in Africa and Asia. This encouraged a new marketing approach with the introduction of branded products. These brands are developed in conjunction with Aramco, aligning the portfolio of the three base oils: Luberef, S-Oil, and Motiva. For the new series of Group II base oils, the aramcoPRIMA brand was launched, in addition to aramcoDURA for the Group I base oils. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[calculated-expansion-plans]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>There is a significant push across the Saudi economy to have more localized production and to use locally produced items. Have these policies had an impact on your business?</h4><p>The impact is not satisfactory. For example, Saudi Chemical used to do a great deal of business with Aramco, though it is no longer at the level it once was. We are currently doing more business with oil companies in Kuwait. We have a contract with Ma'aden, which is our major client in Saudi Arabia. In addition, we have contracts with cement companies to supply them with explosives to excavate raw materials for cement production. Domestic consumption is thus still important for us.</p><h4>How long has the factory in Egypt been in operations, and do you have further international expansion plans?</h4><p>Our factory in Egypt started production in 2010 and produces ammonium nitrate for explosives, which has a high concentration of nitrogen. We sell our Egyptian production to Saudi Chemical in Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Sudan, Kenya, and Oman. This is our only overseas plant. The reasoning behind opening a plant in Egypt was to save cost because producing ammonium nitrate from natural gas is expensive. Our factory is adjacent to a fertilizer factory, and we buy some of our feedstock from it to reduce our costs.</p><h4>Under the Saudi National Transformation Program there is also a localization drive for defense spending. Is Saudi Chemical also looking at possibilities in this area?</h4><p>Yes, we have three products that we are starting to build the factories for. We are in discussions with providers in different countries to help establish our facilities. We have also had discussions with the Ministry of Defense for its support. We only have one client in this sector, the Ministry of Defense, so if we do not secure production it will not be feasible to start these factories.</p><h4>What is the main driver of growth for Saudi Chemical?</h4><p>We have a pharmaceutical factory and are looking to export our expertise. The pharma market in Saudi Arabia is worth SAR21 billion (USD5.6 billion). In comparison, it is worth about USD360 billion in the US and USD200 billion in Europe. Therefore, we are targeting Europe and the US to expand our pharmaceuticals portfolio.</p><h4>What is the extent of your activities in the pharmaceuticals sector?</h4><p>We do both manufacturing and distribution in the pharmaceuticals sector. We have a separate distribution company that saw 20% growth in 2017, and we expect to see similar growth in 2018. Our pharmaceuticals manufacturing company, AJA Pharma, handles the pharma products and registration. We have a total of 40 generic pharmaceutical products under registration, with seven new products that were registered in 2017 and more planned for 2018. We also have manufacturing contracts with international companies. For example, we have a contract with Lundbeck, a Danish company, to manufacture four products. We also have a contract with Gedeon Richter, a Hungarian company. In 2018, we will sign contracts with three other international pharmaceutical firms.</p><h4>What scale will your acquisitions be on and how will they be funded? Are you more interested in acquiring known brands?</h4><p>We are in talks with the government and international banks to provide finance. We are focusing on a feasible portfolio that can generate greater profit, regardless of whether it is based on generics or branded products. We can manufacture these new products in Saudi Arabia and package them in Europe. If we were to register our pharmaceutical products in Europe or the US, it would take forever. It is better to acquire the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and American FDA approvals for our factory in Hail. We are undergoing this process currently through a German consultant company that we contracted to design, build, and get approvals for our Saudi factory. Our aim is to acquire those by end-2018. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[excellence-above-all-else]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What operational changes for YASREF have taken place over the last year?</h4><p>2017 was a thought-provoking year for YASREF, and major improvements took place in regard to maximizing our processing of high-value products. We were limited before in the production of our benzine product, a petrochemical with high margins compared to other products. Since then, YASREF has succeeded in maximizing its production without affecting the blending component of gasoline. Our second achievement is that for a long time most of our downstream units have been running higher than their design capacity; they are capturing the margin with no additional operating costs. This has benefited our annual net income. We are extremely proud of our safety and environmental record, which remain exceptional.</p><h4>How do you measure your environmental compliance?</h4><p>At YASREF, environmental protection has always been our highest business priority, governed by the Royal Commission at Yanbu, which applies strict standards. Nevertheless, our benchmark is to go beyond the expectations of the Royal Commission. As such, we have a strict daily monitoring program through which we constantly analyze water and air flows. From time to time, we receive visits from government officials who look to our facilities as a benchmark. The feedback we receive has been great. Environmental protection, as well as safety, is a continuous process, and we are modifying our systems as we progress.</p><h4>How are higher oil prices impacting the refinery industry?</h4><p>When the prices of crude oil rise, that of the final product also increases. It significantly affects the cash flow side because we pay for the crude first and then sit in the market and cover our cash again. However, the profitability of the refinery is more dependent on product prices rather than crude prices and the time lag in between. When prices of crude go up, not every refinery has the cash flexibility, and refining may thus slow down. This enables companies to improve their market share as well.</p><h4>What are you doing in-house to invest in human capital training?</h4><p>At YASREF, training presents a prime opportunity to expand the knowledge base of all employees to ensure we maintain a high level of competency. We have a head start compared to many other companies in terms of implementing this vital aspect of Vision 2030 because from the start we knew that building human resources was more important than building facilities. We have a dedicated committee that meets on a weekly basis to make sure that localization and Saudization, competence, and experience levels are available at the level that we want. We have succeeded because investment on this front is extremely important, and the outcome is critical to our success in the future. If we have trained competent people, we will manage to compete with others. Our Saudization level is 82%, and more than 95% of YASREF's leadership positions are filled by Saudi nationals.</p><h4>How is opening the economy to foreign investors impacting the local refining industry?</h4><p>YASREF is a joint venture between two leading enterprises in work: Saudi Aramco and Sinopec. Our infrastructure is ready, and from time to time we receive inquiries from foreign and local investors. They want to look into the possibility of building their investment within YASREF to make use of its products. We are always open to that and have an ongoing study with cement factories to look into how to utilize our coke. We also have a proposal from an investor in Saudi Arabia who is interested in utilizing our sulfur product. We plan to go for the chemical side by building a p-Xylene unit. We have almost completed the engineering for that, and both parties are keen to go on with that investment. We welcome all investors and strongly believe that if they succeed, we will too.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have your operations advanced in recent years?</h4><p>MODON is going through a transformation of the approach of supporting the industry here. In the earlier stage, our focus was on covering the country with industrial cities and using the fund to develop as much as we can. We are now moving to more innovative and advanced services in our existing industrial cities, towards smart cities. Following the new government direction, we are now partnering with the private sector to boost the economy. MODON is not just a developer of industrial infrastructure; rather, we are an all-round service provider and industry enabler to empower clean industries with innovative new ideas for the industrial investors. We have been constructing ready-built factories since 2012 and have launched programs to attract entrepreneurs, SMEs, and more women to develop their businesses in our cities. SMEs require different services and we develop the desired ecosystem in dialog with them. For women, we encourage investees to develop by providing them with the necessary amenities, including daycare facilities for children, to be more attractive and comfortable. Currently, there are more than 7,000 women working in the industrial cities. Furthermore, we are working on improving the productivity of our industry partners with programs sponsored by the Ministry of Energy, Industry, and Mineral Resources.</p><h4>How do you utilize technology and digitalization to attract companies to your industrial cities?</h4><p>We are now streamlining and automating the processes within our organization to provide more efficient services to improve the ease of doing business for our partners in order to enhance their contribution to Vision 2030 goals in terms of enabling and developing the industry in Saudi Arabia. Currently, operational licenses for companies that want to settle in our cities can be provided within 24 hours. For land allocation licensing, we have established a 10-day timeframe, which reflects our ambition to target a new type of investments—SMEs cannot wait for months to start their businesses. As part of this transformation, we are empowering the management of the industrial cities, allowing them to deal with most issues on their own. Once our transformation is complete, all licensing, land allocation, and environmental certification can be done in one electronic platform with easy access for investors.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about incentives, packages, and infrastructural development for activities in the more remotely located cities?</h4><p>Every region has its own potential for economic development and employment opportunities, and we want to convey that message. We are currently reviewing our pricing policy to make it more promising and attractive for investors. For the regions, we want to encourage particularly start-ups and SMEs and are working in collaboration with the SME Authority to build incubator centers. We have already constructed one in Dammam, under the Prince Sultan Fund. For other regions, we are coordinating with the Saudi Industrial Development Fund (SIDF) for the provision of loans up to 75%. There is now better alignment between different government authorities, as there is one vision and one objective. In addition, we are studying the unique value propositions of the regions to tailor our approach to their path of industrial development, which we do in partnership with industrial committees via the chamber of commerce. Our cities in the south and north, for example, have a strong agricultural environment, and we can accelerate food-processing industries there. Another example is logistics, which will work well in our coastal areas, and we are working in closer coordination with the Ministry of Transport to execute our master plan. Also in logistics, we see a large role for the private sector, and we strive for partnerships with them. We already have such projects in Jeddah, Riyadh, and Dammam and want to now extend these areas closer to the country's borders, for example ARAR city. As trade has resumed with Iraq, there are many opportunities ahead. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What changes has the Royal Commission at Yanbu seen over the past year?</h4><p>We launched Yanbu as the first smart city in Saudi Arabia and, in the process, have received many awards, including first prize for the application with our partner Huawei and emerging number one amongst 370 global cities in the Smart City Expo World Congress projects 2017. We are both able to increase the appeal for Yanbu as a city and also use some of these smart applications as a source of revenue. Around 300 industrial entities are now connected to our smart city. Yanbu is a vibrant and growing city, with a number of projects being carried out in community areas. This smart city project aims to improve citizens' quality of life via deploying a new fiber network, building a smart lighting control system, improving overall mobility, creating a big data platform, and developing an Integrated Communication Platform (ICP).</p><h4>How is the importance of downstream segments evolving?</h4><p>Yanbu still has the third-largest refining capacity in the world, and as soon as our new refining organizations are commissioned, we will be number one. Other downstream segments, such as the rubber industry, are also developing at a rapid pace in Yanbu. We have two new projects for manufacturing units that will be fully operational by the end of 2018. We are working on the site to prepare for the renewable energy shift, first solar and subsequently wind. Our competitive advantage in this area is that we will not only produce our renewable energy locally, but also produce the cells needed for this onsite. In addition, we conducted a successful project in industrial waste recycling and now have several plants that produce reused oil and lubricants and are exporting them worldwide. All of our water is reused, either in different industrial uses or for our landscape and irrigation needs; we do not have any wastage.</p><h4>What are you doing to support SMEs?</h4><p>We have a number of projects to support SMEs, some independently and others together with the Saudi Industrial Development Fund. The major issue for industrial SMEs is the high CAPEX in this sector. We, therefore, provide ready buildings that SMEs can lease and we support them by training their staff. In this way, they can commission and produce within three months, and it minimizes the time for SMEs to break even. We have gathered all governmental offices in a one-stop-shop business center, whereby we help investors prepare everything they need in terms of certification and paperwork in one place. All procedures can be completed electronically to minimize time and cost. The business center started operations in March 2018.</p><h4>How do the goals of your educational institutions align with Vision 2030?</h4><p>The great thing about our colleges and institutes is that they are all market based. One way to do so is through consulting industrial committees. They evaluate our curriculum to determine if the materials are still relevant and if there are new subjects that should receive more attention. Furthermore, our entire program is internationally accredited and we partner with some of the world's best universities to introduce new programs such as insurance specialties. Some of our subjects, such as our supply chain specialty, are unique in the GCC. In addition, we provide certificates and training for those who are more vocationally inclined. In 2017, 70% of Yanbu Industrial College and Yanbu University College graduates were able to find a job within six months, an impressive figure by international and local standards. Our first batch of female graduates will also enter the labor market in 2019. On an annual basis, 50-70% of the students who join the international competition in science, mathematics, chemistry, and biology are from our schools in Yanbu Industrial City. In mathematics, we achieved a gold medal standard, the first time for Saudi Arabia. In 2018, two of our students received scholarships to MIT and Harvard. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you tell us more about the newly established Wafi and your mandate for the real estate development sector?</h4><p>Wafi was developed to deal with the organization of the sale and rentals of off-plan real estate units, regardless of their purpose or method of development, before or during the construction phase. The program also requires real estate developers to implement approved models and specifications according to the timetable of each project. The program is supervised by a committee set up by a decision of the Council of Ministers, comprising representatives from the Ministry of Housing, the Ministry of Municipal and Rural Affairs, the Ministry of Trade and Investment, the Ministry of Justice, Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA), Saudi Industrial Property Authority (MODON), and two members of the public sector. The committee is also involved with a number of other government agencies, such as the Real Estate Development Fund as well as ETMAM. Wafi seeks to be the leading and distinguished program in the supervision of real estate development projects, serving the country and citizens in the field of real estate development through supervision and follow-ups and the development of effective policies and operational mechanisms. The committee's tasks are focused on granting licenses within a maximum period of 10 days from the completion of the license application for the project and outlining the conditions and requirements necessary for the licensing, sale, marketing, and presenting of off-plan real estate units.</p><h4>What is Wafi's vision for the development of the residential sector in the Kingdom?</h4><p>Wafi works in accordance with the mechanisms and rules that will facilitate the mechanism of citizens' ownership of housing, support supply, enable demand, increase ownership, and facilitate access with various options, high quality, and favorable prices in line with the NTP and Vision 2030. Off-plan sales and rents are tested and proven global concepts. The best way to ensure citizens are able to obtain suitable housing through multiple guarantees provided by the program is to protect them from fraudulent sales and safeguard the rights of buyers and tenants through systems and procedures. These measures are the result of the ministry's vision and dedicated work of Wafi employees. In order to improve the quality of services provided, an online platform was launched to facilitate services for citizens and to follow up on off-plan sales and leasing across the entire country with ease and efficiency.</p><h4>What role can Wafi play to support the ministry's objectives to promote transparency in the real estate sector, encourage competition, and improve the residential sector?</h4><p>The resolution by the Council of Ministers to develop a program to regulate the off-plan sale and leasing sector reflects its interest in boosting the real estate market, organizing it, and encouraging fair competition, which will subsequently benefit the housing sector. The program was based on fulfilling contracts, and the vision is to achieve a transparent real estate environment wherein everyone is on equal footing and the conditions and mechanisms are equally applied to all. Today, Wafi works to apply the highest standards through clear and published requirements. It also enables everyone to engage with the off-plan sale system without differentiation or favoritism in accordance with clear and consistent standards and timeframes. Wafi protects buyers' rights by annotating the title deed of the property, depositing funds in the project's escrow account, requiring an engineering consultant and a legal accountant, as well as field monitoring of the licensed projects and working to qualify and evaluate the developers' assessment. The program also prohibits developers from selling or leasing any off-plan real estate units, whatever their purpose or method of development, advertising in local or foreign media, or presenting them in exhibitions without first obtaining the necessary license from the committee to carry out the activity.</p><h4>How can Wafi drive collaboration in the coming years?</h4><p>Wafi has held a number of joint workshops with real estate developers, specialists in the field, legal accountants, and engineering consultants, with the aim of promoting partnerships and development in order to boost the real estate market. We envision becoming an entity that protects the rights of citizens and an important custodian of the real estate sector investments in the Kingdom, working continually to protect the rights of beneficiaries and ensure their satisfaction. We want to organize the sale and lease of off-plan activities in the real estate market by 2022 to stimulate the supply of real estate and raise productivity, providing housing products at the right price and quality, improving the performance of the real estate sector, and increasing its contribution to gross domestic product.</p><h4>ETMAM was set up as developer services center for the real estate sector and as a governmental central connection point for developers. What are your mandate and activities?</h4><p>ETMAM rules as a connection point for developers and is currently working to raise awareness among real estate developers about the services provided by the center. We participate in exhibitions that publicize the center's role in servicing real estate developers so that citizens will benefit from our services. We held a series of workshops with participation from both public and private sectors to develop ways of cooperation and to identify and analyze the challenges that developers might face.</p><h4>For greater private sector involvement, it is instrumental to have an attractive investment climate. How is ETMAM equipped to pursue this?</h4><p>Like other programs of the Ministry of Housing, ETMAM contributes to creating an attractive investment environment that allows the increment in the domestic and international investments at the real estate sector within the Kingdom. Our common objective is to increase the volume of investments in the real estate sector and to accelerate the pace of work in residential projects. ETMAM works as the connection point through various service-level agreements with different governmental entities. Developers can submit their applications for permits, approvals, and handovers, and ETMAM ensures that these are done quickly and in compliance with the regulations. ETMAM also monitors the real estate development process to develop the necessary system of rules and regulations that facilitate procedures, with the participation of all relevant entities.</p><h4>What are your objectives and expectations for the coming years?</h4><p>For Wafi, we are keen to work on bridging the rapidly growing gap between demand and supply, and to develop a comprehensive and integrated plan to address the problem of both supply and demand through various products. One of our most important achievements is the integrated supervision of the real estate development projects in all regions of the Kingdom led by a Saudi team of distinguished competencies. This reflects the efficiency of the team and the keenness of the committee to conduct business with quality and effectiveness in line with the ambitions of Vision 2030. ETMAM aims to propel the real estate sector in the Kingdom and improve residential development activities with more and better private sector participation. We also aim to improve the performance of the real estate sector and increase its contribution to GDP. Our ultimate objective is to raise home ownership to at least 70% by 2030. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you tell us more about the establishment of NHC and its mandate to engage with the private sector?</h4><p>NHC is the investment arm of the Ministry of Housing as well as the executor of the ministry. Our mandate is to support the ministry to achieve its goals regarding partnerships with the private sector to increase home ownership among Saudi citizens. We also serve as executor for the ministry's initiatives, of which the most important are PPPs; however, there are several others where we will be the operator. Within five years, we aim for the ministry to be entirely self-sustainable.</p><h4>How will these PPPs be structured and tendered to the market?</h4><p>We are working to incentivize the private sector to develop the right number and kind of units for our citizens. We work closely with developers to study relevant data; based on that, we develop the appropriate products and price. We also work on the demand side to enable citizens to buy our products. We play a major role in simplifying developers' financial obligations. Through our subsidiaries, we are creating more services to build an ecosystem that minimizes risk to all parties. This is one of the main incentives for the private sector to get involved: minimizing risk. We work closely with developers to select the product that will be most affordable. We help develop and design the right product at the right price. We know what people here can afford, which is generally in the range of SAR250,000-750,000 (USD66,650-200,000). Our projects are countrywide, though based on our studies and data, we can see that most demand is confined to just eight large cities. We will focus our PPPs on those eight cities; however, there are other programs for smaller cities, and these are not PPPs.</p><h4>Regarding home ownership, are you more involved with buyers or developers?</h4><p>One of our main objectives is to enable suppliers and developers; however, we have several other initiatives that are focused on the lender and the beneficiary. We work to find the right bank for the right developer so that together they can create the right product for the right beneficiaries. We are working to build trust by matching these three aspects perfectly. A successful project is one where everyone is supported, such as providing buyers with solid loans. NHC is, therefore, an intermediary in this tripartite system of developer, lender, and beneficiary.</p><h4>Does that include programs aimed at foreign investors?</h4><p>We are working to bring in and accommodate foreign investors. For the next three years, we aim to provide 480,000 owned units and are in talks with international investors from Turkey, South Korea, China, and others. There is huge demand for housing here, and we seek to increase supply by any means.</p><h4>What ambitions have you set for the coming years?</h4><p>Over the next three years, we will put a great deal of effort into supporting the Ministry of Housing and PPPs. At the same time, we will work on initiatives that increase privatization and even create entities that will be privatized. We will incubate these companies in the next three years until they are capable of sustaining themselves. We have a plan to create six new companies, though the execution will depend on what happens in the market and if the demand changes. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was behind the creation of Education E-Solutions, and what gap in the market did it fill?</h4><p>Education E-Solutions was established four years ago with the main focus of riding the wave of technological transformation since the Saudi economy has been shifting away from oil-based toward knowledge driven. The technology sector is one of the main sectors driving this change. We took the opportunity to create digital solutions and e-platforms to engage the entire community. This includes connecting university, college, and school students through a common platform where ideas are created through their interactions. We provide digital platforms and invite experts, students, and universities to engage in a social community to tackle common challenges and co-create a vision of the future. As part of this, we have been introducing innovative technologies into the market, like VR, AR, and AI.</p><h4>How would you assess the maturity of the digital economy in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>There has been significant improvement in the adoption of e-commerce, e-business, and e-education in both the private and public sectors. We can see several universities adopting and changing their content from physical and paperbased to digital. The goal of Vision 2030 is to have the private sector engage with the public sector to co-share an innovative future. The management of data is essential to reach this goal. All AI technologies and IoT will need data to achieve their potential possibly with the help of neural networks. It is absolutely key and comes from interactions—user-to-user, user-to-machine, and machine-to-machine—as we will see with machine learning or deep learning from AI. Our platform has to be attractive enough for all innovative companies to deploy their technologies and open their data for exchange. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Will the government's Vision 2030 privatization goals impact the medical college's operations?</h4><p>This is an important step for the coming decade because under Vision 2030 the aim is to engage the private sector more in education and healthcare provision. The Ministry of Education is taking steps now to scrutinize the criteria to improve higher education here while at the same time engaging the private sector as much as possible to privatize various activities like hospitals. This will create a great deal of competition between institutions and force them to keep up with the highest standards and prove themselves. In the end, only the best providers will be able to continue in the education and health sectors. We are the first private medical school accredited by the NCAAA both for our institution and our programs. This is an important step by the government because it seeks to create an accreditation body that is independent of the Ministry of Education. This approach is the future for education in Saudi Arabia in terms of training the healthcare providers.</p><h4>What are some of your goals and expectations for Ibn Sina in 2018?</h4><p>In line with Vision 2030, our next target is to participate in post-graduate medical education. Currently, we only award bachelor's degrees, but are now developing master's programs. We also want to meet the benchmark of international schools and have partnerships with other medical colleges abroad. In addition to looking for post-graduate opportunities for our graduates abroad, we are also improving our tools for e-learning. Another important aspect is the use of simulation to augment our medical training. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[boris-van-thiel-general-manager-union-iron-steel]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the key findings of your steel market analysis that led to the restructuring of Union Iron &amp; Steel in the first months of 2018?</h4><p>In order to increase margins, we had to come up with a strategy that was based on a market analysis of the UAE and the GCC, and then Africa, Europe, the US, and Asia. After looking what products of our portfolio the market demanded, we restructured internal supply-chain processes and departments such as finance and procurement. With the addition of new talent, we started our revenue assurance program and determined we were ready to bounce back on the market. The findings revealed that the best market at the moment is the UAE, in terms of both demand and prices, despite dumping practices by Turkish companies. In 2016, we had 75% of our production went to GCC countries and only 25% went to the UAE, which has changed to 75% UAE and 25% GCC in 2017 and 100% UAE in the first half of 2018. Indeed, there is no export market for the Made in UAE steel rebars at the moment, which range from 8-32mm, as other GCC countries have lower prices. This is why we are exploring the production of rebar in coils, for which there is a high demand everywhere, including the UAE, but limited supply. Hopefully in the next 18-24 months, we can increase our export share to 25%, though that depends once again on the demand.</p><h4>How has the UAE market reacted to the steel price increase?</h4><p>Early 2018 saw high local demand projected at 320,000 tons of steel rebars a month by Emirates Steel, which controls the market and sets the price once a month. Emirate Steel can produce up to 180,000 tons, while the remainder will be covered by other mills and imports mainly from Oman at the moment, which has a fairly saturated market and sells over 60,000 tons into a higher-price market like the UAE. Fortunately, since June there has been a 10% import duty effective for steel imports, which protects us from China or Turkey or elsewhere. Compared to the average price of steel rebars last year, prices are around 15-20% higher. This might be positive for manufacturers and traders, but bad for end-users, whose credit lines become strained, which has negative implications for manufacturers and traders, as they are getting 15-20% less material for the same credit. In 2H2018, prices are likely to stabilize and perhaps go down slightly, with demand picking up.</p><h4>How do you expect demand to evolve once prices stabilize, and why do you believe so?</h4><p>The overall demand for steel rebars in the UAE is predicted to be in the range of 4.2 million tons on an annual basis. This is mainly driven by the construction sector in Dubai, more specifically by private developments, with only a limited amount of government projects. In the UAE, there is a strong focus on Dubai and not Abu Dhabi. Some major budgets have been announced recently, though we are currently far away from the realization of these projects. In terms of the local market, 60% of our products is for the local Abu Dhabi market and 40% is for Dubai, Ajman, and Ras Al Khaimah. Since we expect demand to be higher in the future, we seek to increase the market share of our product in the northern Emirates, especially in Dubai. At the same time, high prices for manufacturing make the UAE less competitive than other GCC neighbors, and to maintain competitiveness, as a local manufacturer we require our product to be protected from cheap imports from other GCC countries like Oman, as well from Turkey. In 2017, Emirate Steel reduced prices significantly to compete against Turkish rebars in the market, pushing the idea that it is safer to buy regularly from local manufacturer to mitigate price fluctuations and longer shipment timeframes. The focus should be on buying local products and navigating the misleading information in the market spread by traders.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the Abu Dhabi construction and demand market in the medium term, as oil prices are back in the USD60-70 per barrel?</h4><p>The key drivers of the economies of GCC countries are the oil and gas and petrochemical sectors. After a slowdown in the last few years, the government has sought to diversify its source of income, investing in other areas. Now that the price per barrel has stabilized, ADNOC is investing in further projects, showing there is more capital to be invested in infrastructure upgrading or in lighthouse projects that benefit everyone. This creates a multiplier effect, and the private sector will follow from this development including the steel industry. The oil price in June is a positive signal, and I remain optimistic about the long run. Indeed, until the effect arrives in the steel industry, it takes some lead time, as the project development phase does not need steel.</p><h4>How has the geopolitical tension deriving from the Qatar blockade affected business?</h4><p>There are more people suffering from than benefiting from the blockade; it is challenging and extremely costly. I am personally suffering from the blockade along with many other international companies, many of them headquartered in the UAE. United Iron &amp; Steel has lost an export market, but Qatar's manufacturing must have benefited from the blockade because of less reliance on supplies and imports. At the same time, there are certain countries that are getting closer to Qatar, like Oman and Kuwait, that may have business implications once and if the blockade ends.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Where do you position yourself within the education landscape of Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>UHB is one of the new universities established in the country. We are surrounded by industrial areas, and we can build on this opportunity by providing a well-educated workforce for the industry. Our primary focus is to create graduates in the engineering, computer science, and health tracks. Our university was established around the same time Vision 2030 was announced, and this was the perfect opportunity for us to prove our significance. We are building our capacity and defining our objectives in line with Vision 2030 by providing qualified Saudi graduates to feed the national workforce. Although UHB is a recently established university, we do have a strong and prestigious platform provided by our predecessor universities, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM) and Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University (IAU), to build upon. We hope to continue these achievements and successes by building better programs, expanding on the existing ones, and enrolling more students.</p><h4>What is your vision with regard to the development of soft skills and critical thinking in your graduates and curricula?</h4><p>Between a traditional teaching style (didactic) and a newer-effective teaching style (constructive), we strongly emphasize the latter. The dynamic environment engendered by the new style of teaching is something we are keen to develop here. This is our vision for the future. Our curriculum was designed to enhance critical thinking, and we have embedded all these elements into the curriculum. Soft skills like communication, emotional intelligence, and leadership are built right into it. It is our true intention to provide attention to students at the individual level by allowing a limited number of students in every class, and by doing so we ensure strong interactions between students and instructor. We also manage to send our students to excellent industrial training programs and get regular feedback to know about their learning process and overall performance. Furthermore, English is the communication medium used here, and this applies to most colleges in the university. This gives our graduates an edge over graduates from other universities. Our academic tracks professionalism in our graduates so that they can interact effectively and harmoniously with peers and colleagues.</p><h4>What research agenda do you envision for this university?</h4><p>Our vision for the university is to maintain our status of knowledge hub for the local community. We want to work hand in hand with the community to build our capacity and modify our academic programs. We want to receive feedback from the local community so that we can steer our programs in the right direction. As a new university, we enjoy a great deal of freedom in terms of our future course of action. We have the flexibility to change and grow as new opportunities and challenges present themselves. Additionally, we would like to build strong partnerships and relationships with international universities and organizations in order to focus on both the quality as well as the quantity of graduates. Quality will play a major role moving forward, as the number of graduates is ever increasing. We have strong programs that are fairly unique, and many of our initiatives work to build a knowledge-based society. In this regard, we have a strong and active social media presence that highlights social issues and spreads awareness about cleanliness, plantation, environmental hazards, and so on. The after-effect of our campaign is notably visible in the area around. Moreover, on the technological front, we have acquired our own data center that can provide cloud storage and data mining services to citizens. Finally, an international English testing service will inaugurate a testing center facility in UHB's main campus, providing incessant, accessible, and much-needed service to the people of this region. Similarly, other data managing services will be collaborating with us soon, which will act as a milestone in our journey toward a knowledge-based society. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Where would you position the university within the education landscape, and what are your distinctive strengths?</h4><p>Al-Baha University is a relatively new university, and its initial positioning was to provide a broad range of disciplines to both male and female students. Currently, 14 of our 15 colleges have male and female branches. Al-Baha is a mountainous area, so aside from our main campus, we have four small branches in and around the city where we provide around 60% of our programs to make them more accessible. Furthermore, we have a research, a business, and a medical center. Currently, we serve 26,000 students, mostly from Al-Baha region, but also a batch of international students who come for Arabic language and Islamic studies. All together, we host around 166 international students from 20 different countries.</p><h4>How do you envision better aligning graduation programs with industry requirements?</h4><p>Vision 2030 has given us a wide range of thinking, and the focus on the young generation is the key here. At Al-Baha University, we guide students to build up relevant skills for jobs of the future, specifically in engineering and computer science. The business center plays an important role here as well, where we aim to develop the entrepreneurial skills of our students and teach them how to set up companies. Already, 60 students, male and female, have worked on comprehensive business plans that they pitched in a competition. The top three receive full support to develop their plans as real companies. Apart from this competition, we continue to provide inclusive programs to encourage our students.</p><h4>How do you strive to bring more technology into classrooms?</h4><p>Our computer science college and engineering colleges offer various programs in the field of technology, including ICT and mechanical engineering. The internal IT infrastructure is extremely technologically advanced to stay on par with international practices. The university network allows students to do all their interactions online. To encourage our students, we have a computer science club for both males and females with additional workshops and training programs. On top of this, our staff can follow programs to improve their own skills.</p><h4>What are the main fields of research at the university?</h4><p>Research is an essential part of the university. We have a deanship and a vice president for research, and we encourage our staff to conduct research and apply for funding. In 2018 so far, we have approved funded research for about 90 staff members in different areas. Staff typically apply to that fund, and there is a committee that reviews the ideas and selects the best ideas to support. Also, we work with King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (KACST) to support research projects. We hope to have this funding in the near future to fund specific research for staff members of Al-Baha University.</p><h4>What is the typical mentality of an Al-Baha graduate?</h4><p>A mountainous environment like Al-Baha inspires to think more about nature, ecology, and agriculture. At Al-Baha University, we think about bringing the university and people closer together to think about the natural aspects. Also, we can develop our tourism, as Saudis like to come here during the hot summer months. That includes thinking about a summer program at the university, for example for the youth traveling with their families. There could be training workshops or programs in our business center. We need to think about programs that we need in the future. We need to be able to change our programs going forward to meet the needs of Vision 2030; programs need to be changed to be ready for the new generation of jobs. The majority of the Saudi population is below 30 years old, and this is our advantage. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the university's main strengths, and how have they evolved over the years?</h4><p>One of our major strengths is our location. Tabuk is in the northwest of Saudi Arabia, with a population of 910,000 and close to the new tourism and business hub NEOM. We offer students a chance to get a first-class university education locally. The university currently has 29,000 students and 3,000 staff. We have students from Europe, Asia, America, and Africa, and expanding our international student exchange programs is part of our strategy. We have grown and have been able to build up our structures and programs in various disciplines, including economics. From the outset, we insisted on applying certain local and international benchmarks when building our programs. We have international cooperation contracts with several universities such as University of Louisiana and New York State University. From our inception in 2006, the university's vision has been to develop our own resources and then grow them. The university has 12 million sqm of land at its disposal. We have investment plans and a special unit run by experienced financial experts dedicated to building up our resources. We also have an Institute of Research and Consultation, which is the connection between our colleges and staff and the private sector. Any company looking for consultation services or research regarding specific issues can use our services. The university comprises 11 colleges, 12 deanships, six units, and two centers as well as five university colleges across five satellite campuses. This is in addition to newly establishing another college, two centers, and a unit in line with Vision 2030. A total of 850 scholars have been sent to study abroad covering many fields of science as well as gaining five patents in scientific research.</p><h4>How do you assess the skills that are in demand in the private sector?</h4><p>From the outset, we have worked to establish strong connections with local authorities and companies over time. We also have a great relationship with the local Trade Chamber and the Ministry of Labor, which help us to understand the labor needs in this rapidly changing economy. Each college within the university has its own council with representatives from businesses and local government. We have prepared our latest strategic plan based on Saudi's economic needs and the new projects that are currently ongoing in Tabuk, for example, NEOM and other Red Sea projects. Hence, we have established two new centers and a unit: the Center for Research in Renewable Energy, Center for Industrial Innovations and Robotics, and the Entrepreneurship Unit. They will all help the university be part of what is going on in terms of new projects. We have also established a College of Tourism, since the university is in between the ancient city of Mada'in Saleh and the new tourism and business hub NEOM.</p><h4>What other aspects of Vision 2030 are impacting your operations?</h4><p>IT integration is a vital component of the vision. We are heavily investing in e-learning and distance learning facilities. Most of our resources are available online and most functions are now automated. All our academic registration procedures are online. We have started to run distance-learning courses whereby students do not have to come to the campus at all. Another element is female participation in the labor force. We are among the first local universities to assign a female vice-rector for our female students and encourage the colleges to increase female participation. We have women on the university and college councils as well as committees. Another important element is accreditation; the university encourages its colleges to gain accreditation for their programs. Thus, the mathematics department gained accreditation from ASIIN, CEA accredited the English department, and ABET gave its accreditation for both the mechanical engineering and computing departments. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the institution's main academic strengths, and how have these evolved over the years?</h4><p>KKU has several strengths, such as academic staff, academic programs, learning resources, and infrastructure represented in a new campus. In particular, academic staff at KKU has a great depth of experience and knowledge built into every single subject. Every year, the university recruits the best staff members from different countries all over the world. Additionally, it has excellent visiting professors from Arab countries, the Middle East, as well as Europe. Furthermore, KKU graduates are sent abroad to quality universities for professional development. The university offers a variety of academic programs that are designed to meet the requirements of the labor market. At the same time, KKU has adequate learning resources represented in libraries as well as its participation in Saudi Digital University, which provides 53 databases, covering all scientific fields used by students and academic staff. Moreover, KKU is expanding its operations and hopes that in one year's time, it can begin the gradual move to the new campus while keeping the old ones as well. For research, KKU has an excellent number of researchers who have already published papers in top scientific journals. As far as the strategic plan is concerned, the university has built its academic plan in line with the Kingdom's Vision 2030. Today, it has over 70,000 students, making it one of the largest universities in the region.</p><h4>How important are the international partnerships to the university?</h4><p>Although KKU has signed several partnerships with international educational institutions, they were, nevertheless, not at the level to which KKU aspired for achieving its vision to be one of the top-200 universities in the world by 2030. Therefore, in preparing its strategic plan, the university focused on national, regional, and international partnerships in the three main components of its mission: education, scientific research, and community services. Hence, initiatives have been adopted for three areas within these strategic objectives, the most important of which is an initiative to enhance an academic cooperation, including undergraduate and postgraduate programs. The other initiative is to establish partnerships between KKU and national, regional, and international institutions. Another initiative is concerned with promoting scientific research and activating the partnership with specialized research centers.</p><h4>What are the details about the new requirements for universities to generate their own financial resources under Vision 2030?</h4><p>KKU is a public university and depends on the government's financial support. Privatization is certainly important for the future. However, the university does not think of the education sector as a company. It focuses on its strategic plan to develop its financial resources by establishing an investment financial system of its own, activating university endowments, and developing and activating investment projects. KKU started operational procedures last year to establish its own endowment.</p><h4>How are the technological developments impacting teaching methods?</h4><p>KKU has one of the best deanships in e-learning. It has already developed around 120 online courses that are open to students, as well  as national and international communities. More than 100,000 students have already used these open courses. Additionally, the university has 500 full e-learning courses for students, and 50 training courses for faculty and non-faculty staff. So far, around 4,000 staff members have attended these courses. Not only this, but KKU goes further to have 12 online vocational courses and aims to add more in 2018. Based on the positive feedback received from the public and private sectors on the quality of such courses, KKU intends to develop further courses that meet the needs of various sectors. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Where would you position your university within the Saudi higher education landscape?</h4><p>PSAU is one of the 28 governmental universities in the Kingdom, and it was established nine years ago. Currently, we have around 28,000 students and 2,100 faculty members from different nationalities at six campuses south of Riyadh. In less than a decade, we have grown to be one of the country's top-10 universities in terms of scientific publications—around 400 ISI-published, English-language articles per year. As a comprehensive university, we offer most of the disciplines, mainly sciences, engineering, education, medical studies, business, and humanities. We have five colleges of medical studies—medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, and two applied medical sciences—as well as two engineering colleges, three colleges of education, two business colleges, and five colleges of sciences and humanities in addition to preparatory year college and community college. Aside from our Saudi scholars, we have attracted high-caliber faculty members from all around the world, including Europe, Asia and Africa. We have a competitive selection process as well as an extensive development program for our staff, and we mandate them to pursue their studies abroad at top-ranked universities. In the last three years, we have had an average of 45 faculty members completing their PhDs studies and joining the university annually. We now have more than 550 faculty members studying abroad and all are studying in top-ranked universities.</p><h4>How do you plan to match graduate employability with industry demands in line with Vision 2030?</h4><p>We are keen to have strategic links with all parties, including both industry and the government sector. We have a strategic partnership with the Military Industrial Commission in Al Kharj, which is a great example of this. Furthermore, we have strong relationships with hospitals and other corporations where our students can receive training or follow their fellowship residencies. We have a solid relationship with the strongest universities around the world. We often send our final-year students abroad to spend their summer semesters for training, learning English, and gaining more experience. We strive to offer high-quality programs; in 2017, we received accreditation from Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) for the engineering school in three programs and ASIIN accreditation for mathematics and physics programs. This year, four other programs were visited by ABET team namely, computer engineering, computer science, information systems, and electrical engineering in Wadi Aldawaser. Other programs are scheduled to be visited by accreditation agencies in 2019. With such partnerships and programs that meet international standards, we are confident that we can convince industries that our graduates are knowledgeable, skillful, and competent. University education nowadays is fairly different from 20 years ago, when it was more spoon-fed knowledge transfer. Today, we concentrate more on skills, such as communication, team collaboration, critical thinking, and lifelong learning rather than knowledge only, as these help students meet employer demands.</p><h4>What is your ambition for the coming years?</h4><p>We have ambitious goals, and if we are able to realize them, we can assert PSAU's leading position. Our environment, facilities, and resources, both human and financial, give us a great opportunity for success. My main ambition is for PSAU to be among the top-five or six universities locally and among the top-50 regionally within a few years. Also, we strive to be recognized internationally and to enable  our graduates to create jobs. If 5-10% of our graduates become job creators, that will be a great achievement for PSAU and the country. To promote this, we have established an entrepreneurship and innovation center in the university, which will motivate students and faculty toward creativity, confidence, self-dependence, and self-learning. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of Taif University's main strengths?</h4><p>Our location is one of our key strengths; Taif is one of the historical centers of Arab culture. It hosted the annual Souk Okaz, where poets and merchants came together thousands of years ago. This tradition was revived in 2005 when Taif University—only a few years old—hosted and arranged a cultural program that has been associated with Souk Okaz. We have continued with this tradition, and in 2017, we won an award for best national partner from the National Commission of Tourism and National Heritage. Although we focus on Arab cultures, studies, and history, we also have different colleges, from art, science, computer science, and engineering to medical sciences and pharmacy. Our Colleges of Engineering as well as Computers and Information Technology were accredited by Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology to be included in the international arena. We also recently signed a contract with the National Centre for Evaluation &amp; Accreditation in Saudi Arabia to complete the accreditation cycle for the university. With this, we will be the first of the new universities to be accredited nationally. Though we have 70,000 students and three branches, Taif University is a young institution in terms of its people and faculty. We have almost 600 Saudi faculty and academic staff members and more than 30-35% of them are under 40, making our staff extremely energetic and dynamic. Taif University is unique in its ability to move fast in response to developments around us.</p><h4>What is the university's role in shaping the urban structure of New Taif?</h4><p>The university is central to New Taif, though the new project for Taif University has been on hold due to the economic circumstances. The Ministry of Finance felt the SAR4 billion (USD1.07 billion) expenditure on a University Town was too high. We came up with a new proposal for the government with a SAR2.8 billion (USD747.2 million) budget and subsequently received approval from the Ministry of Finance to start construction. We also actively think about how the university can generate revenue. The entire area of the campus is around 9 million sqm, and we are currently in talks with large real estate and development companies because the new university campus requires entertainment facilities, a mall, and a convention center, which the university will not build. We can allocate the land and work with developers. We also recently established the Taif University Investment Fund, which is close to the investment community, and our land can be marketed accordingly to attract investment for the new campus.</p><h4>What short-term courses do you offer outside of the standard curriculum?</h4><p>We have a project called Taif Summer Academy, an elite program in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) subjects to be held in summer alongside English studies. We decided to partner with Oxford College and ID Tech for this program. Saudi Arabians tend to send their children to summer camps outside the country; however, we wanted to offer the same level of education within the country. We also aim to attract foreign students with our new unit for teaching Arabic and culture for non-Arabic speakers. In Saudi Arabia, there are four centers that teach Arabic as a foreign language; however, they are all purely for academic purposes. We have invested in educational tourism and established this unit not for academic purposes, but rather to combine a short one-month course with exploring Taif. We have started to publicize this and have received over 20 applicants thus far from diplomats and so on to join our first open program in July 2018. We expect great demand for this. The first completed project in the New Taif campus is the dorm, which can host over 2,500 students, so we already have the residence for our international students. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What distinguishes PSU from other public and private institutions in KSA?</h4><p>What distinguishes PSU is primarily our academic structure and flexibility in decision making. As a private university, we are nimble and responsive to the needs of the job market. Additionally, the diversity in our population is a plus; we currently have 34 different nationalities amongst our faculty members and over 25% of our enrollment is international students. Our academic facilities are also equipped with the latest technologies. As the first step in a crafted three-stage curriculum, the focus is on cultivating soft skills as the students go through a one-year preparatory program that aids the transition between high school and higher education. Then, moving onto the second level, they select and do their university programs. The third, and capstone element, level is the co-op program. This is a rigorous seven-month immersion into the workforce that narrows the gap between the theories learned in the classroom and the practices of the workplace.</p><h4>How have you achieved a high level of internationalization in terms of students?</h4><p>International students know very well what they will receive when they come to PSU. PSU has proven the success and value of private higher education through its quality academic programs. Over the years we have developed a reputation for the rigor and thoroughness of our programs and the quality of our graduates. Our programs are designed to bridge the gap between education and employment through on-the-job training cued directly to the job market. Public universities have a great mission to educate and graduate the young adults of our nation. We have a more flexible remit, and the international students enhance the experience for everyone. </p><h4>PSU's graduates are in high demand from the private sector. How do you develop curricula to meet the market's needs?</h4><p>It is extremely important to match the skills university graduates possess with what the job market needs. Three parties have roles to play here: the private sector, universities, and the government through the Ministry of Education. We have an advisory board in each college that meets once a year. These boards are drawn from the business and professional communities. With all of this input, we update our programs frequently with the help of international consultants as well. For example we reviewed and upgraded our law program a few years back. PSU was the first institution to start a law program for female students in 2007. After two waves of graduation, we assembled an international committee to work on updating our law program and had it reviewed by law professors from the University of Richmond, Cambridge, and Harvard Law Schools. Typically, lawyers are either familiar with Islamic law or US or UK law; we want our graduates to have knowledge of both. The fact that our students have moved on to renowned American law schools, such as Harvard, Duke, Columbia, and UC Berkeley for their LLMs and passed the New York Bar Exam demonstrates the quality of our programs.</p><h4>Is the sector witnessing a period of change, and if so, how are your goals impacted?</h4><p>PSU contributed significantly to the National Transformation Program (NTP). The university started on that campaign with its Community Services and Continuing Education Center's Education for Employment (E4E) program in 2009. It is specialized for unemployed local university graduates. Candidates are screened and selected on merit. Participants go through the program for 16 months, first building up proficiency in English and development of practical skills. They then move on to advancing up levels of professional certifications. We want to nationalize our E4E model and see it adopted at other universities across the country with guidance from PSU. Higher education has to deal with the evolving professional needs of the 21st century, and in this sense, we have been part of this reform for nearly a decade.</p><h4>What are your plans for the next 12 months?</h4><p>Our strategic plan is focused on research and NTP initiatives. We have established a Research and Initiatives Center that has three components: PSU Research Review, an international scholarly journal; pursuit of NTP initiatives led by research teams from our five colleges; and lab research and group projects that signal the identity of PSU research work and raise the impact of our published works. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>UBT recently set up UBT Academy, an English training institute franchise. How has this progressed in the last year?</h4><p>The progress throughout the last year included approving the entire curriculum and recruiting the required manpower. In line with the strategy set out, UBT Academy signed an agreement with one of the largest IT consultancy firms to develop an IT policy. UBT Academy has developed a model for master franchises and aims to sign agreements in Bahrain, Kuwait, and the UAE. UBT Academy targets six branches by the end of 2018 and another 12 branches by end-2019. As soon as the model is implemented, replicating that model takes approximately three months, which is the same time required to develop the facility itself. We will either find an investor or simply invest ourselves, develop it for one year, and then sell it. Institutes typically focus on the general public, teachers, or training professionals; however, none focus on the holistic approach of English training for the entire community. UBT Academy offers six different programs and a handful of institutes under one brand. It is an English institute, a training institute for teachers, and a school accreditation institute packaged into one franchise. The beauty of UBT Academy is its partnerships with the top publishers around the globe, creating a unique curriculum based on each country's requirements. The core business of UBT Academy is not to produce the content, but rather to adopt global best practices and leverage them. UBT Academy combines the best of the best together in one curriculum with the most qualified and competent staff and standards for assessment to create a modern learning experience.</p><h4>UBT Company has been developing its own system to measure all aspects of its performance. Can you tell us more about this?</h4><p>UBT developed a model named Quswa. Currently being registered for property rights, Quswa is an effectiveness and efficiency initiative for universities that measures every detail, including water vapor, LED lights, and the cost of various activities. UBT was honored the Digital Excellence Award from Oracle in 2017, which noted that UBT is the only university in the world that applies activity-based costing in its enterprise resource planning (ERP) implementation. UBT developed the ERP structure as a result of its global outreach and growth. Thus, UBT needed to standardize practices and measure both sources and resources that either incur costs or generate profits. Similar to a KPI audit, today we measure it all and are able to quantify a university from A to Z. If the same is done in public universities, quality and efficiency would triple, saving a minimum SAR60 billion (USD16 billion) per year. UBT Company is ready to diagnose any public or private university for free. UBT Company aims to help other institutions—and society at large—become more efficient and deliver better services.</p><h4>The Saudi economy has had a difficult year, and yet you have many new directions and programs. How are you moving forward despite fiscal tightening?</h4><p>The overall market, including that of the private higher education, is shrinking. However, UBT has not seen a drop, but rather an increase its market share. In late 2017, UBT College of Law was launched. UBT has reshaped the programs it provides, while introducing five new graduate programs. In terms of employability rate of our graduates, UBT is the pioneer in meeting the needs of the market, of which we are extremely proud. Based on a recent UBT survey, 78% of our graduates are employed—the highest number in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. UBT graduates receive their first full-time job within six months of graduation on average. Founded in 2011, the fourth batch of our UBT College of Advertising is graduating next term, with 100% of the students already employed. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you fit into the higher education landscape of Saudi Arabia?</h4><p><span></span>DAU has been following a strategic direction to position itself at the cutting edge of higher education in the region, and this was largely through attaining the accreditation of the National Commission for Academic Accreditation and Assessment (NCAAA) in 2017. Achieving accreditation was the culmination of years of hard work and development. DAU has invested heavily in recruiting and retaining high-value faculty who are considered leaders in their fields. This high caliber of faculty allows for groundbreaking research in our colleges. The combination of our faculty members and their research facilitates DAU's partnerships with local and international giants of education and industry to come together and continually ensure DAU provides sustained and valuable services to the local community. DAU is proud to be considered a leader and trendsetter in the higher education landscape of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.</p><h4>Your curriculum is developed in consultation with King Fahd University of Petroleum and Management (KFUPM). How has this collaboration developed, and what is the impact on students? </h4><p>KFUPM is one of our distinguished partners, and we are proud of our mutually beneficial relationship. In recent years, there has been universal acceptance amongst leading universities that teaching soft skills and critical thinking is of paramount importance and needs to be a core component of a student's learning experience. DAU ensures that core soft skills, such as citizenship, innovation, and the development personal values, are clearly embedded into curricula to ensure DAU graduates have the highest value in the market and are fully capable of meeting the demands of the 21st century society and Vision 2030.</p><h4>How do you strive to align graduate employability with industry requirements and Vision 2030?</h4><p>DAU relishes the heavy responsibility that Vision 2030 places on higher education. DAU graduates already enjoy tremendous rates of employability; however, the university is in a continuous process of aligning DAU graduates' skills with workplace requirements through a blend of strategic partnerships and learning communities. DAU strives to fill the gap in the market by constantly developing and creating solutions to market challenges and producing the graduates needed to meet the goal of Saudization and Vision 2030. DAU's consultations with the business world allow direct input from industry on curricula content and projects, and a significant budget is allocated for serving the community through research. For example, in recent years, DAU responded to the market and now operates two new colleges: the state-of-the-art College of Medicine and College of Dentistry. Vision 2030 demands the highest standards from DAU, and we ensure these standards through successfully achieving external validation through accreditation by bodies such as the NCAAA and, for its college of law, the High Council for Evaluation of Research and Higher Education. Furthermore, DAU encourages students to actively participate in learning communities to promote personal development before they graduate. This blend of external and internal strategies makes DAU optimistic in regard to achieving the objectives of Vision 2030.</p><h4>What role does research play in your university, and what are your primary focus areas?</h4><p>Vision 2030 will ensure the Kingdom is a knowledge-based society, and DAU is playing a critical role in this regard. DAU has invested heavily in upgrading the education and skills of its students to enhance the Kingdom's human capital. DAU has always been committed to serving the community and regularly participates in training programs, debate competitions, and other community service programs. Furthermore, DAU also views its partnerships with industry essential to building a knowledge-based community. DAU's dynamic partnerships ensure industry help develop curricula to prepare DAU students for swift employment, and DAU's faculty cultivate student's skills and capabilities through its cutting-edge educational instruction and programs. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you tell us more about the mandate and scope of HEF's operations?</h4><p>Due to the need to ensure multi-generational equity, a Royal Decree was issued in 2001 to restructure the mechanism of stipend dispersion by establishing a higher education fund. HEF has been mandated to invest the remainder of universities' budgets on a long-term basis, whereas a portion of these investments is available to fund universities' projects on an ongoing basis. HEF was established with an ultimate goal of supporting the sustainability of funding of Saudi universities. Universities can utilize HEF's resources and network to fulfill their purpose with activities that range from conducting a research project to constructing new colleges.</p><h4>Does your organization choose how to invest the remainder of the funds on structural strategic projects?</h4><p>HEF's roadmap is outlined by its board of directors, and the implementation of that is monitored by its investment committee. The combined efforts of highly qualified members on the board of directors, investment committee, and HEF staff are directed to generate the highest possible risk-adjusted return to the universities. HEF invests in a multi-asset portfolio that complies with a strategic asset allocation that takes into consideration HEF's special objectives and constraints.</p><h4>What are the most strategic areas that require your funding or are interesting for the Kingdom at the moment?</h4><p>Every funding request received from universities follows a systematic process to ensure that the project is eligible for funding. However, we do not impose any constraints on the nature of the request nor do we require a strategic area for the funding, as we are here to serve universities and we aim to support them to achieve their specific long- and short-term goals. Our focus is to grow our portfolio and deliver the maximum returns on universities' balances.<br>In August 2017, the Ministry of Education concluded an 'Invest Wisely' partnership with Tadawul, aiming to improve financial literary. Could you tell more about this collaboration?<br>Tadawul approached the Ministry of Education to discuss an opportunity to educate and raise awareness of the stock markets. We were the facilitator between the Ministry of Education and Tadawul; we prepared the agreement between them and made sure that all the universities' needs are met in Tadawul.</p><h4>Do you also intend to reach out abroad with your investment portfolio?</h4><p>HEF already has an international portfolio that invests in multiple countries and different asset classes. Moreover, we are increasing the size of this portfolio to achieve greater diversification and minimize concentration risk.</p><h4>What strategic goals have you set?</h4><p>Our vision is to be the investment arm of Saudi universities. We invest part of the universities' assets and make our expertise available to enable their investment in local and international markets. Universities might have new regulations that will allow them to invest directly in the market and achieve greater financial independence, reducing the burden on the government. We assist universities utilize and grow their own resources and work with them to become self reliant. These new regulations will affect all universities, and HEF is responding to this in advance to provide the needed support, especially for those with limited experience and capabilities to set up and manage investment portfolios. HEF is a non-profit organization, and there are no charges for our financial services. In the end, we support the financial sustainability of the education sector by upholding fairness among universities and equity between generations. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In accordance to your mandate, what are your activities to set standards in higher education and quality control?</h4><p>Our main goal is to drive excellence in all higher educational institutes and to help universities to improve their performance continuously up to international levels. To this end, we built a new set of accreditation standards that respond to the immediate and long-term needs, which are outcome-driven rather being process-driven as before. The new accreditation standards are impactful, economic, flexible, and scalable. NCAAA does not work as an inspection agency yet; however, it helps universities and faculties build up their capacities and improve their caliber for continuous development. We provide training, consultations, and a versatile range of support to all types of universities, including those established 50 or more years ago, 20-30 year-old universities, and newly established ones. Our accreditation standards concern two major domains, namely institutional capacity and educational effectiveness.</p><h4>Education is considered a major pillar under Vision 2030. What does that mean for NCAAA?</h4><p>It means a great deal; Vision 2030 requires a skilled, impactful, human capacity, which is directly related to education and training and is the core objective of NCAAA. All educational institutions and their academic activities must be aligned and coordinated in a suitable frame that serves Vision 2030. There is a clear shift in student preparation and evaluation from knowledge to competencies including the soft and future skills necessary for 2030. The economy is rapidly changing; the labor market and needed jobs of the future are completely different from those of today. We must be ready and responsive to serve the vision through effective student preparation.</p><h4>How does the NCAAA meet international benchmarks, and to what extent are you collaborating with foreign partners to do so?</h4><p>We meet the international benchmarking on several levels including the individual level, where we cooperate with international experts in training and  external review of institutions, and on the institutional level, where most of our work such as the accreditation standards are subject to international evaluation. Moreover, there are many MoUs in place with several international bodies such as the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) in the area of accrediting IT and engineering programs, as well as many others in the area of medical education. We are a member of ANQAHEE and the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA), and are working on obtaining a full membership from INQAHEE. This, in turn, will reflect on Saudi universities' ranking on the global stage. At present, there are five Saudi universities among the world's top 500, and we plan to have five in the top 200. Saudi universities are currently the best in the Arab world.</p><h4>How do you envision increasing the amount of research done in the country, and what are some of the ways it will be funded moving forward?</h4><p>The amount of research is one of many concerns. The added value of the produced research—its impact on shifting to a knowledge-based economy—is a serious issue that we are working on. The newly developed accreditation standards include a complete standard on scientific research and innovation, and we are preparing a specific indicator for this standard to be able to calculate the international indicator, to which the performance of each university could be compared. A proposal for ranking the universities based on scientific research regarding productivity, creativity, applicability is under consideration. Having the link between scientific research and its applicability will change the funding map and landscape where the industrial institutions will accelerate funding for excellent research, enhancing the quality of research. All these are supported by restructuring the universities and widening the governing bodies and boards. We are focusing now on new directions such as artificial intelligence and other fields that will increase the citation index of Saudi research. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[an-ever-greater-insight]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has your film expertise and vision for Al Montage developed over the years?</h4><p>Al Montage sought to be a film production company from the beginning. We started an agency and had some artists as well as a small film division with just two staff who did the camera work and editing. We learned from our mistakes, including how different the pricing structure is when running a service business like ours. Two years after our establishment, we recruited an entertainment industry consultant who supported us in our ambition to become the largest production house in the Arab world. We reorganized the company and focused all our resources on production. It took us three months to adopt the new structure and set up, which was a challenging period for our business performance. Subsequently, business skyrocketed because we had the right processes in place, we knew exactly what we wanted, and we had a strong and accurate pricing model, along with the right skills in place. The market needed production houses that could deliver within schedule and this is what Al Montage could offer. We reinvest our profits into the company, for example by buying additional top-end equipment and training our people to advance our pool of skills.</p><h4>Where does Al Montage stand today?</h4><p>We are moving onto a new challenge, namely optimizing our processes and investing in new areas. We are moving from manual to digital processes so we can have advanced reporting, while also gaining a greater insight into even the smallest details of our business. We are developing a CRM system. The entire process will be on a digital platform where we can monitor the timing and issues for each stage. We also see a number of gaps in the market where we intend to invest. It is a challenge in Saudi Arabia today to find the right cast and crew for a film, video, or commercial. We want to create an online platform where one can search for and hire talent. We have already launched a beta version and the feedback from the production houses and customers is that they greatly appreciate this service and want to use it. We are currently in the process of optimizing this platform and building the user experience ready for release in the market by 2Q2018. The platform will also enable people to search for shoot locations and stock footage.</p><h4>Who would be your clients for this platform?</h4><p>Our clients are the production houses in this case. In the case of stock footage, this is built up by the community, and production houses, companies, the private sector, the government, and freelancers all pay to use it in their own productions. There are many stock video websites globally; however, there is none specifically for the Arab world, and this is where Al Montage can offer added value. We decided to invest in this area because of the gap in the market where people struggle to find the right talent, crew, and locations. Furthermore, if a client does not have a big budget, we can mix the production between live shoots and stock footage to reduce the cost for the customer. For example, it would cost a minimum of SAR60,000 (USD16,000) to fly a small crew in to film the mosque at Mecca; however, one can buy stock footage for USD3. By offering this platform, we fill this gap in the market. We rely heavily on the community to make this successful because this library of videos is built up by the community. The community has to share on the platform to make it work. This will be an important milestone for Saudi cinema because now that cinema is opening up here, there should be many productions taking place, with the new sources of funding in the country. Film producers need these resources to make their films, and our platform will help them. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[simplicity-and-trust]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have you positioned Lebara Mobile as mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) in the telecommunication landscape?</h4><p>The Middle Eastern mobile markets have relatively high barriers to entry for MVNOs, though we have succeeded in capturing our market share nonetheless. We found a niche with our offering and have gathered a strong subscriber base. The frequent changes in the regulations in the Saudi telecommunications have not distracted us from our focus; it encouraged us to streamline our operations. Globally, our focus is to target migrant communities and medium- to low-income nationals with pay-as-you-go SIM cards, which is how we started in 2014. Before entering the Saudi market, Lebara had experience in building successful MVNOs in eight countries, and we have the know-how to target the underserved segment of the market that we are in. Simplicity and trust are our core values, and we have built our entire business on these.</p><h4>How do you envision Lebara Mobile being part of the Kingdom's comprehensive transformation trajectory to diversify the economy?</h4><p>Vision 2030 has opened up major opportunities for the technology sector, and we will certainly be a part of this journey. Saudi Arabia is in a unique demographic position, with 50% of the population under 25. The current leadership of the country is young as well, understands technology better, and wants to make a real change. With NEOM and the opening up of the entertainment industry, the Kingdom is set for a major transformation. This also means an influx of FDI into a broad range of sectors, as our economy grows more open and transparent. The total revenue of global telecommunications industry is anticipated to be almost EUR1.2 trillion by 2019, and Saudi Arabia has the highest mobile penetration, which means great opportunities lie ahead. The coming years are all about offering differentiations to our customers, and as the country opens up, we explore new tools and partnerships to provide more products and services. Vision 2030 gives a unique momentum to agile and dynamic companies to grow quickly and to serve customers better, and we want to be part of that wind of change.</p><h4>How do you envision becoming more active in the domain of the Internet of Things (IoT)?</h4><p>The Communications and Information Technology Commission (CITC) issued two public consultations, one related to relaxing regulations and the other on the intention to issue licenses called IoT-VNOs, which is an MVNO that specializes in the IoT business. These regulations will facilitate our IoT positioning as we already have the proper infrastructure and expertise to enter in this market.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the telecommunication market in the coming years, especially with regard to data?</h4><p>The opening up of VOIP communications has had a negative impact on our voice revenue, while it positively attributed to the data demand of our customers. The shift to data is  global, and like our operations in other countries, we are building our projects and offerings around this shift, for example, free minutes with data packages. IoT, along with other data-heavy mobile phone applications like video streaming and online gaming, will boost data demand in the years to come. For gaming, we are working on new partnerships.</p><h4>What are your ambitions for the coming years?</h4><p>We want to diversify and transform our telecoms business to align with Vision 2030 requirements. The telecommunication industry is rapidly developing, and we want to stay ahead of the game. Telecommunications—voice and data—will remain our bread and butter for the time being, though we will explore and materialize all the opportunities to broaden our services. We strive to create new revenue streams and change the way we approach the market. We are an international brand with a national heart. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have Ebttikar's operations advanced in recent years?</h4><p><span></span>We have been in business as a subsidiary of the National Technology Group since 2008, but were launched in 2003 as the result of a merger between three companies. We are a system integrator and an end-to-end IT systems provider. Ebttikar's biggest strength is client relations, providing added value to clients, and guiding the client to choose the best option. Some of our accounts have been with us or our predecessor for 30-40 years now, which is a clear proof of our ability to deliver and maintain customer satisfaction over decades, given all the developments and competition in the market. There has been a massive technology shift globally in the last few years, and companies today no longer require an IT department as they can outsource all these tasks. Our assets are our employees, and they have the highest certificates from companies such as Cisco and Huawei.</p><h4>What role does a technology company like yours play in transforming the country?</h4><p>Vision 2030 provides opportunities for every kind of technology company. They have a chance to guide the direction of the leaders of the country, especially when it comes to transforming the economy. Tech companies should be extremely agile to adopt changes, and we must understand our customers' business drivers and provide technological solutions capable of achieving their business objectives. For the last two years, we have been changing steadily to adopt new technologies and services in order to meet our customers' business objectives. There are high expectations, and everyone has to contribute, including the female workforce. It will be a completely different ballgame, completely centered around achieving customer business objectives rather than selling technology solutions.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Virgin Mobile Saudi primarily targets the youth, which comprises nearly 50% of the Saudi population. What is your positioning in the market?</h4><p><span></span>From a demographic perspective, youth is the primary target in Saudi. The mix is sufficient for Virgin Mobile Saudi to penetrate the market as we are right at the forefront of innovation and are able to see where there is an issue and fix it. It is about making mobile better by providing a better service and delivering our services to the customer at a fair price. In Saudi, there is a particularly strong need for excellent customer experience. The penetration rate for mobile is dropping, but it is still a dynamic market because the demographic mix is changing. Therefore, our focus is shifting slightly, while the values remain consistent. We are still determined to target the youth by tailoring our products and services as per their needs and preferences. Virgin is an active, wild brand, and this is what the youth like to see. Over 50% growth in Virgin Mobile KSA's revenue in 2017 despite the challenging market conditions has not only placed us at the forefront of the industry but has also made our competitors follow our footsteps.</p><h4>Virgin Mobile has found a niche in addressing its customers differently. What did you do?</h4><p>Virgin Mobile has entered new markets multiple times around the world, including the US, Australia, and Europe, where each environment is slightly different. When first addressing the Saudi team in 2016, I told them we were going to change the industry perception of how to do business, and everyone would replicate what we are doing over the next two years. We are already starting to see that now. Our model is slightly more advanced in the way we engage with people and promote best practices. We are a place where well-being and happiness are essential.</p><h4>With the growing demand for data services, what challenges is Virgin facing in retaining customers and acquiring new ones?</h4><p>It is a classical evolution we have seen in mature markets. For example, back in 2014 in the US a mobile package came with unlimited data. That is a mature market, and that is what is happening in Saudi today. We see a huge shift here today from voice to data, and credit goes to the positive changes in the regulatory environment. We place a great deal in favor of our customers at the moment because disruption is not about gaining but giving. Gaining comes afterward. Fair competition is always healthy as it forces telecommunication companies to innovate, invest, and put customers first. At Virgin Mobile, we always try to stay at the forefront of innovation and disruption in order to make mobile better for our customers. This will mean that Saudi Vision 2030 can be achieved due to investments in technology, innovation, disruption and R&amp;D. That said, it is up to those who own the networks and the regulators to develop along with this technological transformation.</p><h4>What are your expectations for growth at Virgin and in the sector in 2018?</h4><p>Where we are going next with technology is something that is on every leader's agenda today. Few truly understand what digitization means, what benefits it will bring to business, and how it will happen. People are slightly reserved on taking this step despite the fact that everyone wants to have digital assets. Businesses are wondering if it is cost saving, streamlining, rationalization, or some other benefit they are trying to achieve. And how is this going to be better and different for the customer? Not everyone is clear where they need to go next, while the Saudi regulator has issued a public consultation process. It is promoting new innovations in the country, mainly IoT, which is great. Virgin Mobile has earned its place in Saudi, therefore, there is a great deal of support to move forward and compete more. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you tell us more about the recent launch of Fasah, the platform to improve cross-border trade with a single window?</h4><p><span></span>One of Vision 2030's main visions is maximizing the value of Saudi Arabia's great location between three continents by creating a unique logistic platform serving the logistic movement between Europe, Africa, and Asia, which means that facilitating trade across the border is a top priority. Our previous portal, SaudiEDI, had been in place since 2004, though it was only focused on customs services. Traders still needed to follow manual paper submission processes and go to multiple government agencies to receive clearance. The Kingdom recognized that it was necessary to have a single national export/import platform serving the traders via a single window, without the need of manual or redundant document submittal to the different government agencies, in a way that provides full cost transparency and tracking visibility. This is what we started working on in 2017, based on the direction set by Saudi Customs and Saudi Ports Authority. We are building a single window electronic platform that aims to have full interaction with all related government agencies. We are just starting, and what we have launched so far is the first step. We will rollout the integration with SFDA and MEWA in four of Saudi's major ports, which represent more than 60% of the country's total import volumes. We already covered the integration with railway operator, air cargo, and express mail companies. We then launched a national import-export platform named Fasah in May 2018, which we plan to integrate with around 27 government agencies. We have support via royal decree to expedite the integration process, which will help fully transforming the clearing of imported and exported shipments. Now we have a custom community system and a port community system that are integrated. By integrating these systems with other government agencies, we are working toward creating a single, fully integrated platform. </p><h4>How does this new system work within the 24-hour customs clearance initiative?</h4><p>The 24-hour initiative is the result of combined effort. One of these was the alignment and cooperation between the Saudi customs and ports authorities on the business process re-engineering. We were part of the IT enablement of the new process. Saudi Customs' acceptance of traders' electronic filing submittal was a major part of the success of this initiative. Previously, shipments required that traders manually submit documentation at the customs office. This process was extremely time consuming and inefficient. Now, the Saudi Customs and Ports accept electronic copies of documents, which makes doing business much easier, greatly improves transparency, and maximizes the time of those looking to import or export goods, which is a major piece of the puzzle. Another piece is the port operator, which is responsible for organizing container movement. We created a service that allows us to have full visibility of containers' location, scheduling, and tracking within the port, which creates vast efficiencies and maximizes transparency. The last piece of the puzzle revolves around changing the businesses processes of the Saudi Ports and Customs. </p><h4>How do you intend to further streamline the ecosystem for imports and exports?</h4><p>Within ports, we have helped to optimize document submission and container movement. In August 2018, we launched electronic payments, which removed the need for cash in settling invoice payments at the port. We strive to provide our clients with full transparency, which includes providing e-invoices that have a full breakdown of charges. Traders currently have no transparency on their bills, since they are handled by customs brokers, which makes them vulnerable. This electronic payment service will change that. As part of our efforts to fully optimize port activities, we are now working with the Port Authority on the truck scheduling to the ports and getting rid of unnecessary congestion. Our current pilot service in Jeddah Islamic Seaport and King Abdulaziz has greatly improved truck movements in and out of the port. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess Dubai's progress toward achieving the target of 20 million visitors by 2020?</h4><p>The image of Dubai is accompanied by the words quality, innovation, and excellence. On the business side there are globally-renowned exhibitions and Dubai has taken a major step by winning the right to host Expo 2020, which is a great achievement for a such a young city. From the millions of visitors to the Expo, 70% is expected to come from outside the UAE, which would be the largest proportion of international visitors in the Expo history. All these visitors will witness infrastructure of the highest quality and enjoy great networking opportunities and ease of doing business. In terms of our property, Address Dubai Mall, I am proud to say we have a 20-25% repeat clientele rate, somewhat significant given the competition in the city. This is exemplary of how people love the city. Transforming from a small village into a great city that is now a global hub, Dubai has a reputation for being a visionary city that does not follow but forms its own destiny through the spirit of possible and the wise foresight of its leaders. The launch of Dubai Future Foundation is a great recent example of the ongoing quest to shape the future of Dubai. There are many people who come to Dubai two or three times a year for various reasons, as it is a world-class business and leisure destination where one can find almost anything.</p><h4>What does Dubai's tourism and hospitality sector need to address to stay ahead of the curve?</h4><p>Dubai is already addressing the main trends and challenges. One of the main hospitality trends at the moment is to support the creation of three- and four-star hotels and residences, and the government and the authorities have taken measures to encourage these hotel segments to expand. This is positive for Dubai as the more diversity on offer, to suit every budget, the likelier it is that the city can secure more visitors.</p><h4>What is your vision for the further development of tourism in Dubai?</h4><p>The authorities have taken positive steps to ease visa procedures for visitors and professionals, as well as expanding Dubai's offering to a wider, more international audience. Dubai is in the process of establishing new source markets attracting visitors from India and China in addition to traditional markets such as the UK, Germany and Russia. Tourism is a central pillar of Dubai's economic growth, and Dubai Corporation for Tourism and Commerce Marketing (DCTCM) follows a strategic roadmap to position Dubai as the first choice for both business and leisure travelers, which has already resulted in many successful initiatives. DCTCM communicates its vision with all relevant stakeholders, such as airlines, hotels, and tour operators, and assists them to achieve their objectives in the UAE.</p><h4>How will Address Dubai Mall's renovation plans harness the hotel's strength?</h4><p>We need to remain up to date and have to reinvest in our product and people. We came up with a renovation plan for Address Dubai Mall. The inventory in Dubai is increasing while the average rate is declining slightly. As competition grows, we have to stay ahead of the game and remain fresh. The renovation will be a great opportunity for us to execute what our customers are looking for. We listen to our guests through different channels and highly value their feedback. I hope to meet the expectations of our guests or even exceed them.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[reaching-the-citizen]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Yesser has been in existence for some time, but has a new mandate for change. Where do you come in?</h4><p>Yesser has an important mandate in the digital transformation. One of the pillars of the digital transformation is digital government, and we are currently moving from e-government to digital government. We are building an entire digital ecosystem that goes beyond the simple electronic access of past years. Instead, we are focusing on three things: increasing the number of digital services delivered by the government to citizens and their integration; pushing, motivating, and enabling government agencies to use shared IT platforms such as data centers of financial platforms; and building standards, measurements, practices, and architecture to deploy IT in the government within the enterprise architecture office. We will set up a national office that governs IT deployment in government entities and provides standards, measurements, practices, and architecture. The value of this is to align each agency with a strategy. In the past IT spending was led by technology, which caused a great deal of waste in spending and parallel implementations, since it was not in line with a strategy. For this last goal, we have three important KPIs. Number one is the UN's e-government ranking, where we scored number 44 in 2016; by 2020, we should be ranked no lower than 30. Number two is open data, which we will focus on significantly. We have a second version of our open data platform coming in 2018 that will be extremely smart and intelligent. We are working with the government to publish no less than 200 data sets on the platform in 2018 to improve our ranking from 74 to 69 in the open data parameter. The third KPI is achieving 20% savings in the government's IT expenditure.</p><h4>What approach will Yesser take, and what authority does it have to impose comprehensive strategies?</h4><p>To be successful, digital government needs to be led by all. In the past, there was no central authority for this effort, so our strategy has been to work with the entire government. We will sit down with all of the ministries and create digital strategies. Additionally, Yesser now reports directly to the National Digitization Committee, a committee headed by the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology that has members from all major ministries. This change and new structure will drive transformation within 2018 and beyond.</p><h4>How does your focus on citizens influence how you carry out operations?</h4><p>A decade ago, we used to do e-government as electronic transactions, which are limited in scope. Digital government is about the human touch and the values this implies. It is about talent, development, and user experience. Our target, for example, is not to go to a paperless government but to a complete digital experience that can truly satisfy citizens' needs. We have an ecosystem called e-Murasalat that is an e-correspondence system. We seek to eliminate paper communication within and between government bodies. The new system is a highly secured, automated, and electronic system that will serve government agencies as well external communication. Our target by 2020 is to have more than 160 agencies using it, leaving us with 85% paperless government. Citizens do not care about letters being sent from ministry to ministry; however, they care about all the ministries working together, as this means faster, better service. The e-services that help citizens today are because of the backend system, and whatever we do has to reach the citizen.</p><h4>What do you hope to achieve within the next 12 months?</h4><p>We are focusing on the KPIs of the UN ranking, open data, and wise spending in IT. In the immediate short-term, our biggest priority is the unified portal saudi.gov. We currently have dozens of platforms, which are not yet citizen-centric. Our target this year is to revamp Saudi.gov.sa and implement the first waves of the 100 most needed government services. The second biggest priority is the e-Murasalat ecosystem.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What model are you using to bring efficiency to government entities?</h4><p>Thiqah brings innovation, agility, and trust, which helps us move together with governmental entities to ensure we have one simple goal. Our relationship with those entities relies on one aspect, success. Their success is ours, and vice versa. Therefore, we make sure that when we bring a product to Saudi society, we bring the best we can. As with any other company, sometimes we need to choose where to go next. We build things from scratch, and sometimes we take advantage of current systems up and running in the market. When we choose the second option, we usually choose the best in the market. With the Ministry of Health, one of our missions has been to make sure everyone in Saudi Arabia has access to primary healthcare. Traditionally, this has required physical locations, such as clinics, and since Saudi Arabia is a large country, clinics need to be everywhere. The Ministry thought of having an alternative with the purpose of providing a better service to the people. Telemedicine is booming in the market, but the actual global adoption rate is still low. Saudi has a large young population, and reports tell us that technology usage has a 90% penetration rate in Saudi. That is why we thought to take advantage of telemedicine services to provide primary healthcare; however, instead of us utilizing the opportunity on our own, we prefer to go back to our core desire and include the private sector and SMEs in every possible opportunity. We looked for platforms that were already built and that deliver the same purpose of telemedicine within Saudi Arabia and found an SME that fit our approach and direction, one with whose founder we could collaborate. In order for us to centralize services, we planned on having one telemedicine helping each and every person by using doctors online through mobile apps to reach out to patients, and vice versa. However, this plan negatively impacted the clinics as opposed to providing them with better services. We did not solve the issue because doctors were still needed to efficiently respond to the patients on the app. Then we came up with an artificial intelligence (AI) option so that patients can provide their medical histories and current symptoms to receive a preliminary report that will help the doctors more quickly identify what is ailing them. </p><h4>How is your e-commerce application developing in partnership with the Ministry of Commerce? </h4><p>This application is called Maroof, and it is a platform on which all e-commerce vendors register and are rated by consumers, guaranteeing a certain level of authentication and liability. People see the products through Maroof and rate what they have received. Those comments and rates are accessible to all on the platform. Another aspect is that Thiqah will not build an e-commerce platform. As a state-owned company, our mission is not to compete with the private sector, but to enable it and cooperate with SMEs. This means that what we did with Maroof was build the infrastructure. We asked the private sector to join us and take advantage of all the data we had, after which they can sell through their platforms. We enabled them to grow faster and further without us intervening in the market. </p><h4>How else are you involving the private sector in Vision 2030? </h4><p>We have a lot of ideas and solutions, one of which is a program called Sharakah, which means partnership. We have built amazing platforms to link the public and private sectors, and since we have accessibility to them, we have leveraged our privilege with the government and commercialized upon these ideas. Yet, instead of Thiqah commercializing every aspect, we allow the private sector to take the credit. We then share that data with the private sector so that anyone can build a platform or application to help the Saudi people. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us about the history of Tamkeen and how you meet the needs of a rapidly changing public sector that is digitalizing to streamline services?</h4><p>Tamkeen Technologies was established at the end of 2013 as a company that offered IT services for three government agencies reporting to the Minister of Labor at that time. However, in the middle of 2016, the board of directors decided to transform the company into a fully-fledged IT service provider for the government sector. To accomplish this goal, Tamkeen executives went through a corporate restructuring exercise that resulted in a new organizational structure being approved by its board of directors in December 2016, and fully implemented in April 2017. Based on the new directions for the company, an aggressive strategic plan was developed for the fiscal years 2018-2020. The basic goal of Tamkeen's new strategy has been to focus on three main areas: implementing Public-Private Partnerships (PPP), supporting the adoption and deployment of open-source technologies within government agencies, and helping government agencies extract value from their data by improving their business processes and commercializing some of them.</p><h4>How does your business model function, and how are you paid?</h4><p>We have four different revenue streams. One is a typical IT outsourcing contract in which government agencies that want to employ IT resources but need help screening, attracting, and retaining talented IT resources come to us, since we have a proven track record in hiring and retaining qualified Saudi IT talent for clients. In the second case, Tamkeen provides its clients with managed services in the areas of IT infrastructure, information security, customer care services, and more. The third is executing projects in response to public tenders or private invitations. However, in such projects, Tamkeen is selective about the projects we bid on, such that we prefer to bid on projects where we can make a significant impact or can outsource large portions of the project to the small and medium Saudi companies; hence, allowing them to participate in projects they otherwise wouldn't. The fourth is where we develop PPP programs, and this is where we concentrate on the most. The principle we adopt is that we help government entities find solutions for the problems they have by customizing one or a combination of our prebuilt products to solve the problem at hand. We do this at no cost to the government entity as long as we are allowed to commercialize and offer an elective premium paid version for the service. The main reason behind this approach is that government agencies can take a long time to build their IT solutions, starting from gathering the requirements. After the project is awarded, the vendor starts to design, build, test, and deploy the solution. This is a lengthy process, during which IT technologies and business policies might change, making the targeted solution obsolete and outdated before it is even completed, which leads to cost overruns and significant delays. At Tamkeen, our approach to PPPs is unique to the government sector but in line with the current trends in the mobile software industry.  </p><h4>Are you growing in terms of revenue?</h4><p>We predict an annual 20% growth in revenue and profit for the coming three years, with an estimated annual increase in headcount of 15%. We met these targets in 2016 and 2017 and expect to meet or exceed them in 2018.</p><h4>Why are government-owned businesses such as Tamkeen booming at the moment?</h4><p>The national Saudi IT industry has several key pillars and cannot fully flourish and blossom unless they are strong. They are: government IT departments, government IT companies, multinational IT companies, and local private IT companies. Government IT departments traditionally suffer from inflexible government pay structures, which impacts their ability to attract and retain top IT talent. As a result, certain government entities have either established their own IT companies or rely on government owned companies such as Tamkeen.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does Bilfinger Tebodin's priorities reflect the trends the region is witnessing from an industrial and energy management point of view?</h4><p>The dynamics around us define and refine our priorities. The Middle East is transforming away from a traditional pure-hydrocarbons-based industry and using that natural wealth to diversify and build a future of efficiency and sustainability. Bilfinger is well positioned within these plans; our century-long focus and expertise in both the worlds of CAPEX and OPEX give us the privilege to serve our clients along the entire value chain and support their efforts not only to build things better, but also to run and manage them more efficiently and sustainably. On the CAPEX side, we begin with an idea to start with detailed value engineering and then move onto the project to ensure that the money being spent results in the highest return of capital. On the other hand, the amount of money spent to maintain and sustain the industry is significant, and that is the OPEX cycle, where Bilfinger enhances efficiency and increases productivity whether per molecule, per ton of production, or even per MW produced. To extract value from every barrel, one needs to have the holistic view starting with what you build (capital allocation), how you build (CAPEX optimization), and how efficiently and sustainably you operate those assets (OPEX). </p><h4>How do you project the recent asset allocation toward natural gas impacting the hydrocarbon industry, and where do you see the greatest potential on the digital front?</h4><p>The natural gas industry and the petrochemical and power sectors in the Middle East have come a long way relatively fast, thanks to competitive production cost. However, as the region grew in population, consumption and export needs also grew, putting the available capacity under pressure to the extent that allocations for petrochemical production growth became a stretch. New exploration, marginal fields, sour and ultra-sour, and even unconventional assets all came into focus, albeit at a higher production cost, thanks in part to energy security considerations and the economic viability of petrochemical industry from a cash cost point of view. However, there is an internal source of productivity and additional capacity that is not fully explored. That is what we call “gas liberation." It starts with basic efficiency measures in power sector to produce more, enhanced desalination solutions to reduce power consumption, integration of refining and Pet-Chem assets to better utilize side streams, and leverage hydrogen, CO, and CO2 as strategic molecules. Also substituting gas with other molecules conducive to recovery such as nitrogen mix, CO2 allows additional capacity to be directed to where the return is higher. On the digital front, the energy and hydrocarbon industry have not really tapped into enormous possibilities.  The role of digital transformation starts in better designs, more efficient processes but stretches on far beyond into the world of data; not just to acquire data but to structure and capitalize on it. That is where the equation “big beats small" is no longer valid: it is more like “fast beats slow," as data is all about speed, agility, and productivity. This is why digitization will have a much bigger impact on enhancing operations. In this sense, sensors and data points (digitization) play a crucial role in collecting data; next is getting the industrial IT and OT to connect and exchange (digitalization); but the journey does not end here, as structuring data leads to identifying patterns and smart algorithms that help optimize the underlying process (digital transformation), where the value is created. We take this and apply it to the OPEX hemisphere, for example in hydrocarbon industry, where billions of dollars are spent to maintain the production. And that is where Bilfinger comes in with BCAP to help customer move from reactive maintenance and transition from a predictive to a prescriptive outlook. This is where we can squeeze the dollar from every barrel, molecule, or mega-watt. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of ETLCO?</h4><p>Our growth started over 33 years ago with RC Holding and followed the major developments in departmental government growth, such as Saudi Aramco. We got our own particular start in 2009, opening offices in Jubail. We started growing while providing our services to RC and Saudi Aramco. After that, we moved to our current head office; in the future we plan to open offices in Riyadh and Jeddah, among others. We cooperate with companies from Spain, the UK, the US, and Switzerland. We are on the right track, though it took some time for the Saudi government to decide to join the environmental international agreements and communities, a move that is accelerating the need for environmental developments. There is a great future ahead for the environmental sector in Saudi Arabia.</p><h4>What have been the major developments of the company?</h4><p>In the beginning, there were only six of us; now we have 120 employees. We have five mobile stations and a major laboratory in Saudi Arabia. We are starting a new business in odor management related to containing the smells and noises in industrial plants. We are the only company in the Middle East with this kind of engineering lab.</p><h4>How are you improving the environmental quality of communities?</h4><p>We share and present ourselves to main clients and attend all exhibitions, as well as listen to all government plans. When we go to a site, we advise our clients on what they must do. In addition, we train workers in environmental safety and educate people in the field in areas such as how to store chemicals or correctly transport them so that they will not affect the environment.</p><h4>What type of companies require your services?</h4><p><span></span>Any company working in an industrial city that requires a license from the government to certify they are qualified in environment protection. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[private-competition-public-gain]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have your operations changed over the last year?</h4><p>Last year was one of survival for Saudi Arabia, a period we have yet to fully emerge from. This means the economic conditions have forced us to focus on our existing services and improve their quality to secure our market share. It was not advisable in 2017 to open new lines, an endeavor which always entails large investments. However, we are optimistic and believe better times are around the corner. This is why we have decided to open a completely new line: oil recycling. One example of how this will be operationalized is by taking the carbon ash from burning oil and reuse it in cement production as fuel derivatives. This reduces the cost of the cement and gives it more strength. At the same time, it is beneficial to the environment, as carbon ash is usually difficult and costly to get rid of; you cannot just put it in a landfill because if it mixes with sand or other materials it becomes a fire hazard. We just secured the partnership for this line and already did a promising study for a local cement factory. The technology has been approved and is already being used on a pilot scale. But we will even go further beyond recycling. We will be generating actual energy from oil sludge, the first time this technology is used in the Kingdom.</p><h4>How would you assess the regulatory framework regarding environmental issues?</h4><p>The brand-new Ministry of Environment, Water, and Agriculture (MEWA) is trying to create regulations and enforce them. The fact that it is a fully fledged ministry and not merely an authority means that it has real power to make an impact. The age of merely doing environmental studies is over; we are now seeing many positive initiatives coming out of the ministry to create regulations and enforce them. That is a welcomed improvement, and although it does not always go as fast as I would like it to, it is certainly moving in the right direction. Part of this is also driven from the bottom up, in terms of raising environmental awareness in the country. This is symbolized by the rise in environmentally focused non-profit organizations, of which we are a member of several. They are working hard in developing public awareness in alignment with the government.</p><h4>How is the growing number of PPPs within the framework of Vision 2030 impacting the environmental sector?</h4><p>The success of these showcases how the vision is making a broad and positive impact. The most obvious dimension of this can be seen in the creation of new cities and islands through this model. That is to say, private involvement comes with efficiency gains, as companies compete with each other to come up with the 'smartest' proposals, those that minimize the impact on the environment in a cost-efficient manner. Equally important is the way in which privatization efforts are making an impact. Since they need a stable and sustainable environment, there is now zero tolerance toward corruption, and those who have abused their power for financial gain are now being held to account. </p><h4>What potential do you see of further expansion outside of Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>We already have an Environmental Consultancy Firm in Qatar and have recently been approached by one of our partners to expand into the UAE. Environmental services in the Gulf are young; there is much room for growth. We are lucky to be one of the early adaptors in the region, and this is a large part of our competitive advantage, as does our experience with the public and private sector. Our shared culture with the rest of the Gulf also translates into similar business practices, making it easy to expand. The global need for environmental services will only grow. The demand is everywhere, and we will supply it. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the operational changes for NESMA Water &amp; Energy over the past year?</h4><p>2017 was not an easy year for the water sector. Most of the projects were put on hold. While there was an announcement of several new PPPs under the build-operate-transfer (BOT) model, few actual tenders came to the market. In that sense, 2017 was a preparatory year for many companies; businesses streamlined and prepared their operations in expectation of release of privatization projects. NESMA held a series of meetings with a number of local and international companies, including potential consultants, in order to be ready with the new National Transformation Program (NTP) 2020 requirements going forward. As the result of these efforts, NESMA has been able to secure a partnership with one of the largest water companies in the world. This partnership was already qualified to participate in the bidding for a number of new privatization projects for seawater desalination and sewage water treatment, such as Dammam ISTP, Rabigh 3 IWP, and several others. This is an encouraging indicator for us, and we are focusing our efforts on securing a competitive position for these opportunities. As far as the local market is concerned, we have been working on several projects with the Ministry of Environment Water and Agriculture (MEWA), the National Water Company, the Saudi Industrial Property Authority and others within the government and private sector. In addition, we have also delivered a number of projects related to operational maintenance and building greenfield infrastructure, which includes full comprehensive infrastructure solutions for water, power, lighting, civil works and asphalting, all resulting in a rapid increase in workload.</p><h4>What is your opinion of the newly implemented VAT?</h4><p>It is a great step forward for the country. VAT brings additional revenue to the government, which will enable the government to plan and provide improved services to the public. One could expect the current VAT rate of 5% to be gradually increased as the country continues to make public investments for the future. It aligns well with Vision 2030 since the country aims to be a pioneering and global model of excellence on all fronts. Those companies who adopt to the new challenging business environment will thrive and growth whilst those who cannot will perish.</p><h4>How has privatization transformed the sector in the last several years?</h4><p>We have started to see many strategies and plans come into action as NTP is being implemented. In the past, investments were from large plants with engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC)-type projects whose procurement was financed by the government. Today, this is not the case. There are announcements of desalination plants and sewage treatment operations with international water companies, and efforts are underway to develop request for proposals (RFP) for the network operations and maintenance. These are management contracts that may be long term. The assets of the network are expected to remain 100% owned by the government within the privatization scheme. Under the NTP 2020, seven executive programs have been launched involving 24 governmental ministries and entities that will have a significant impact on implementing these changes. The entire environment, water, &amp; wastewater sector is reforming, and we have seen new tasks and responsibilities assigned to the MEWA, the Saline Water Conversion Corporation (SWCC), the Water &amp; Electricity L.L.C (WEC), and the National Water Company (NWC). The sector is heading in the right direction, and more privatization efforts are underway. This will facilitate the NTP 2020 objectives to be met in the future.</p><h4>How is localization or Saudization affecting the water sector and broader economy?</h4><p>As envisioned in NTP 2020, the Saudization and localisation policy will help achieve our key objectives of contributing to job creation, strengthen partnerships with the private sector, and boost overall growth. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have you advanced with the implementation of new initiatives and technologies in the Saudi water and wastewater market in recent years?</h4><p>AWPT has grown to become a vital player in this market in the past three decades. In recent years, we managed to assert ourselves as the leading operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) and engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor, and our lead in the market comes from a sustainable operational philosophy with a strong code of ethics, performance-driven management, and deep subject matter expertise. Our clients keep us accountable for the high quality, new technologies, and operational excellence that we deliver, which has catapulted us to becoming the go-to contractor in this field. We are currently the leading water and wastewater operator for the governmental and semi-governmental sector, including the Ministry of Environment, Water and Agriculture, and the National Water Company. AWPT operates over 40% of Saudi water and wastewater infrastructure in 40 towns and cities, serving the critical needs of a large portion of the population. In addition to the O&amp;M arm, we have proven our integrated EPC capabilities by the successful and timely completion of numerous challenging projects throughout the Kingdom. With the current privatization efforts in this sector, we are pursuing public-private partnerships, concessions, BOT, BOO, and other contract schemes to implement our long-term growth strategy. We actively go after the privatization of green and brownfield independent sewage treatment plants (ISTP), desalination plants, utilities concessions and distribution systems.</p><h4>What are the possibilities for more renewables, and how can AWPT contribute to the Kingdom's sustainability agenda?</h4><p>Building on our expertise in the water and wastewater sector, we are leveraging our position as part of a diversified manufacturing and commercial group of companies to further enter the field of renewable energy in the Kingdom. Within our current operations, we implement renewable solutions in the design as well as execution stages. We always adopt a sustainable and environmentally-friendly approach to everything we do. As for the market of renewable energy itself, we mostly strive for international partnerships where we can deliver on EPC and O&amp;M services. We consider the best opportunities to be in solar and wind initiatives, and it is important that Vision 2030 has outlined a comprehensive transformation agenda that calls for participation from all parties involved.</p><h4>How do you achieve local capacity building and innovation within the company?</h4><p>We believe in the interdependency and integration between knowledge transfer stemming from partnering with international firms, and our deep knowledge of the local market has made a substantial contribution to local capacity building. Given the demanding nature of privatization projects, integrated partnerships between local and international firms are the cornerstones of successful projects. All sustainable partnerships should have these complementary components. In this sense, we have implemented strategic partnerships with internationally recognized industry leaders in the water and power sector. We always seek compatible partners where we can combine our local know-how with their international expertise, apply the latest cutting-edge technologies, increase efficiencies, and formulate a competitive financial structure. In terms of local talent development, we strive to recruit more young Saudi talent and invest in providing long-term careers for them. Saudization is integral to our responsibility toward the country and community, especially when it comes to building our engineering capacity and know-how. It is key to the success of the country in the future, and we are doing our best to play our role.</p><h4>What will come of the set privatization agenda in the water sector and ambitions to build more power capacity?</h4><p>Following the rapid growth in population, industrial expansion, and sprawling development, there is an ever-increasing demand to improve efficiency and capacity upgrade of the current water and power infrastructure. In line with NTP 2020's targets, there have been complete restructurings of the governmental infrastructure and new mandates to reducing inefficiencies across the board. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize Solidarity Takaful's position in the market?</h4><p><span></span>Our vision has always been to offer the best takaful products that comply with sharia principles, all the while serving customers in a way they have not been served before. This was not an easy journey, and while the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA) works to help takaful companies, we had to come up with a hybrid model to satisfy the customer and regulator. As a result, the company was established with a unique model—one that would distribute the company's surplus, if there is one, to its customers. Some companies now seek to follow the same model that we created.</p><h4>How do you distribute the surplus to your customer base, and how is it different from what was done previously?</h4><p>The company's role is only to take a percentage of what customers paid in order to provide its services, rather than using the entire premium. The model we use is that everyone contributes to our takaful pool, though at the end the company takes 5% for management fees and a 10% performance incentive for its employees. The remainder goes back to policyholders as long as there is a surplus in our portfolio. No one else has this unique model, and we are extremely pleased with how it is working. Our customers are also pleased by how much they get back from their overall annual contribution. Sometimes they use it to renew their policy, and sometimes they simply take the cash.</p><h4>How have adjustments in the framework by SAMA impacted your operations?</h4><p>SAMA is working on organizing the competition and avoiding the bad practices that previously existed in the market. It is also working on being fair with both companies and customers. In prior years, customers were not aware of their rights. One challenge SAMA is tackling is aligning the insurance market with Vision 2030. New products are needed in the market, and we see international companies that seek to enter the Saudi market and want to have the right insurance plans while they are here. We received news about a few special products that will be introduced in the market. Through our coordination, we came up with new products that will be extremely helpful for newcomers.</p><h4>What products have been growing in demand in recent years?</h4><p>We have 67 products in total. We work to have a great mix in our portfolio, avoiding concentrating on just a few. Some companies do not do this; however, it is key to our success. The market is open, as is competition. We need to use this opportunity to build a balanced portfolio, without depending on anything specific. We have life, marine, engineering, medical, and motor, for example, and some of them are compulsory, while others are commercial.</p><h4>Do you provide packages to your customers?</h4><p>We do have packages, though they are limited; offering too many packages could be complicated. We prefer to let our customers select what is most useful for them. We always try to offer whatever they may need and keep their business within our company, though the competition is challenging. People are now more aware of insurance than they were before. They previously believed it was unacceptable and not compliant with sharia. However, they now better understand what it is and the benefits it can bring. They also know there are specifically sharia-compliant products on the market to which they can contribute and still get the same benefits. The industry has flipped 180 degrees. 2017 saw the market expand to nearly USD9.87 billion, and the growth is ongoing. There are still some challenges, especially during this transformation period, but growth should continue. It all depends on how people understand the market.</p><h4>How well do people understand life insurance?</h4><p>Life insurance is still a huge challenge in Saudi Arabia, and we are working hard to convince our customers how important it is. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was behind the process of setting up this company?</h4><p>The idea of Bayan started in 2014 in response to a lack of data in terms of obtaining credit, especially for SMEs. The Ministry of Commerce and Investment found a gap in commercial, business, financial, credit, and receivables data not only in Saudi Arabia but the entire Middle East. There was a large feasibility study that took us more than 10 months of comprehensive data gathering and research evaluations; we visited many countries, met with several major players in the credit bureau world, and surveyed over 4,000 businesses in Saudi Arabia, including banks and financing houses. Results showed that there was a high exposure of receivables in Saudi Arabia only dedicated to medium- and large-sized companies. Around 75% of large companies refuse to sell on credit to small companies, and even if they do, their credit terms are typically 30 days, which is short compared to the 90 days typical for large companies. SME lending is extremely low in Saudi Arabia, at around 2.4-2.5% of lending portfolios, compared to around 8-10% in other countries in the Middle East and 20% globally. When it comes to data analysis, there are many layers of data that Bayan analyzes; First is the commercial layer, namely the owners, their holdings, the company's registration details, and so on. The second is financial information of SMEs and their secondary data; third is financial data, which previously could only be found on public companies published on Tadawul. We are also creating a new layer that includes trade credit information, the first time a credit and a trade bureau have been integrated in the region. It is a fact that of the 1.2 million registered businesses, around 98-99% are SMEs, though coverage of their credit data is only about 6%. This means there is no data, previous banking relations, or credit records for 94% of SMEs. Regarding risk data, we focus on different risk layers: the supply chain risk, receivables, and payables risk.</p><h4>Where does all that information, long been hard to obtain in Saudi Arabia, originate?</h4><p>Since 2014, the Ministry of Commerce and Investment has done a great job by establishing a new platform called Qawaem Program, which translates into “financial statements program." The ministry has also amended some laws and clauses in the commercial law, and companies now have to submit soft copies of their financial statements for renewal rather than hard ones. The role of Qawaem is to receive data, but it needs front-end commercial platforms to distribute this data to beneficiaries since it is regulated and licensed by SAMA within the Credit Information law. SAMA conservatively sets forth certain guidelines and procedures not to allow data of the subject company to be released to any company before its consent, so that mandate was given to Bayan. This is the first time that a country has an integrated hub starting from registration of information, order confirmation, trade received payables confirmation, and banking and financial information. This will help Saudi Arabia, the SME Authority, Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA), and the Ministry of Commerce and Investment achieve their targets and boost SMEs' contribution to GDP to 35%.</p><h4>Will you still function as a credit bureau in the sense that banks will pay Bayan for the data it has processed?</h4><p>Any bank, wholesaler or individual, selling on credit—no matter if they sell goods or issue debt—will benefit from Bayan's services. Since the government is keen to support the commercial sector toward achieving Vision 2030 and building a transparent business environment in Saudi Arabia, it decided to invest 55% into Bayan, 15% of which will be through the Takamol Holding company and 40% through Thiqah. We have flexible products, so a small store can subscribe to Bayan, provide us with their data, and benefit from our platform. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will PPA participate in the country's sweeping changes?</h4><p>PPA participates by aligning itself with different strategic objectives, targets, outcome-oriented initiatives, and commitments achievable through public-private partnership (PPP) efforts currently underway. It will take advantage of its access to deals and priority privileges to participate in different investment opportunities arising from the privatization efforts of previously government-owned assets and services. To further enhance our ability and readiness to take advantage of new opportunities, PPA has also invested in strengthening its internal institutional and human capabilities, as well as studying new best international models and practices for pension fund investments.</p><h4>How have recent economic and budgetary changes affected PPA's returns, and how has it changed its management to reflect on this new era?</h4><p>Undoubtedly, the recent economic environment has impacted the performance of our pension portfolio. However, PPA's investments are well diversified across asset classes globally, thereby offsetting, to some extent, the impact of underperformance of our local market on the overall portfolio. This strategy will continue to explore new investment opportunities coupled with developing a stronger risk management function.</p><h4>Saudi Arabia has made extensive commitments to green energy. How might PPA participate in this aspect?</h4><p>PPA has already demonstrated its support of initiative in this sector through investment in ACWA Power, a unit of ACWA Holding Company, and we will remain open to investment opportunities that emerge in the renewable energy space.</p><h4>There is a shift in the country from the public sector providing much of the capital for major projects to the private sector playing a leading role. How will this change the PPA's investment strategy? </h4><p>Vision 2030 strongly promotes private sector involvement in both old and new sectors and provides myriad opportunities in social and community-related projects—such as housing, health clubs, and public facilities—and the education, healthcare, municipal services, tourism, energy, environmental, industrial and manufacturing, oil and gas, technology, and transportation sectors. PPA will continue to view and evaluate investment opportunities both from a micro and macro perspective by taking advantage of local and international investment opportunities, identified through our research, that fall within the constructs of PPA's strategic investment objectives.</p><h4>There are reports that the King Abdullah Financial District may be sold to the Public Investment Fund (PIF) in the medium term. What is the future of that project, and does real estate remain a sector of focus for PPA?</h4><p>King Abdullah Financial District is still under negotiation, hence, we cannot really elaborate upon that. However, we have other real estate projects, such as the 7,345-unit development in Jeddah and Digital City in Riyadh. Real estate is an important part of an efficient investment portfolio, which is why we will continue to allocate toward it as long as valuations are attractive.</p><h4>Although pension funds have performed well locally, they are still an emerging industry as a percentage of GDP when compared to countries such as the UK. What changes are key to spurring growth in the sector?</h4><p>Growth in the sector is mainly a function of the size of the participants within each pension scheme, changes in demographic profiles of the contributors and pensioners, and the scheme structure. It also depends on the ability of the scheme to adapt to various local ambitious development plans and global geo-economic developments, and manage its investment portfolio suitably.</p><h4>What are you plans and expectations for the year ahead, as well as your most immediate priorities for that timeframe?</h4><p>Our immediate priority is to implement our goal of creating a new asset management company that will run leaner and be more focused on becoming a trusted leader in investments, and to deliver the services needed by our contributors and pensioners though various channels. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of the decision by MSCI to add the Kingdom to the MSCI Emerging Market Index?</h4><p>Inclusion in preeminent global benchmark indexes, such as MSCI, FTSE Russell, and S&amp;P Dow Jones is a significant milestone for Tadawul and the Kingdom as a whole. This will result in significant foreign investment inflows, which will further support liquidity in the Saudi capital market and diversify opportunities for issuers and investors alike, contributing to greater market maturity and stability. The upgrades indicate a growing investor confidence in the Saudi market, reflecting the rapid and significant progress in the implementation of capital market reforms in line with Vision 2030, and further signifies the accessibility of Tadawul to international investors. It is an important step forward in achieving Tadawul's goals of becoming an active player in global capital markets and of building on its current role as the regional hub, leading capital market development in the GCC and the wider MENA region.</p><h4>What impact have Tadawul's series of reforms and market enhancements had on the market and investors?</h4><p>In 2017 and early 2018, Tadawul introduced an unprecedented array of enhancements and developments to improve market access and efficiency, enhance liquidity, bolster investor security, mitigate risk, reduce price volatility, and further align market practices with global practices. These key reforms and enhancements include the establishment of an independent clearing house to develop clearing services and guarantee all asset classes are traded on Tadawul, paving the way for the launch of a derivatives market in 2020, and the introduction of other new asset classes. Second, we are moving toward a closing price auction and enhancing the opening price auction in line with practices adopted by most other major markets. We are also updating the Independent Custody Model (ICM) to enhance qualified foreign investor access to the market by providing greater flexibility in trading limits while mitigating settlement risk. We have adopted a T+2 settlement cycle, a delivery versus payment (DVP) settlement system, and an independent custody model to bring market practices in line with international best practices and norms, while the Securities Depository Center (Edaa) has been spun out and is now a fully independent company. Furthermore, we are introducing securities lending and covered short selling, the first market in the region to do so. In terms of corporate governance, we are strengthening our rules to enhance both the rights of shareholders and boards, and improve transparency. Lastly, in January 2017, we adopted International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) for all entities listed on Tadawul to strengthen disclosure and comparability. The cumulative impact of these measures is a more efficient, liquid, and secure market for investors and intermediaries that is further aligned with global best practices. These measures also paved the way for fulfillment of MSCI, FTSE Russell, and S&amp;P criteria for classification as an emerging market, which is expected to further boost liquidity and investor confidence in the Saudi market.</p><h4>What is the significance of the Central Counterparty Company (CCP) and what role will it play in the future development of the Saudi capital market?</h4><p>CCP will be responsible for developing future clearing services and guaranteeing all asset classes are traded on Tadawul in accordance with the best international risk management practices and standards. It is expected to be fully operational by 2H2019. The establishment of an independent clearinghouse is significant for the Saudi market. First, it will further strengthen the current market infrastructure, reduce systemic risk, and increase market efficiency by introducing mechanisms to ensure that the settlement is complete, and that all parties meet their obligations when settling trades in the market. By guaranteeing the settlement process, it will enable derivatives trading and the introduction of new asset classes, which will further diversify opportunities for both investors and issuers. Finally, it will further align the Saudi market with international norms and best practices, enhancing the attractiveness of the market to all investors.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you tell us more about the range of services you provide?</h4><p><span></span>Proven SA provides business support solutions to clients in three main areas: immigration and government relations, HR management and advisory, and business process outsourcing and shared services. We provide a full spectrum of solutions that support both local and foreign businesses navigating the Saudi market in the above areas. In the past nine years, we have built an extensive knowledge base, and our team of consultants strives to stay on top of the ever-changing local regulatory environment. We enable our clients to focus on their core competencies, while Proven takes care of non-core functions, including government relations, human resource management, recruitment, payroll, finance and accounting, and IT support. Our staff specializes in their respective areas, ensuring the highest quality levels for all service delivery. Thus, our clients can maintain a lean operational model in a cost-effective manner while ensuring that quality is not compromised in the performance of non-core functions.</p><h4>What are the recent trends in employment, and how has female employment advanced?</h4><p>Vision 2030 has had many organizations looking inward to identify areas for improvement and efficiency gains. Many organizations are now pivoting toward hiring from the local talent pool, especially with the rising costs associated with maintaining an expat workforce. This localization has become more of a strategic necessity for Saudi organizations, as opposed to a simple operational requirement, and more organizations are starting to realize that and taking active steps toward localization. This leads them to rethink their existing operational models, redefine cost structures, and find new efficiencies. They are now investing more in long-term, sustainable HR policies as opposed to short wins, which were possible with expat labor pool. On the supply side, the local labor pool has made immense improvements compared to just five years ago. This is especially prevalent with female candidates, who are highly educated and equally motived to add value to the organizations they join. The potential for female candidates to create value for the local economy is further enhanced with the social and regulatory changes being implemented rapidly. This allows organizations to further adopt new localization strategies, develop long-term HR capabilities, and reduce turnover through active retention.</p><h4>What does Saudization mean for your international sourcing of candidates and overall operations? </h4><p>Proven SA is on the frontline of the local market when it comes to the Saudi human resources industry. We have been observing a significant shift in strategy from the demand side since late 2016. As such, we have adjusted our own service offerings to better meet our clients' needs. We have always invested heavily to develop specific capabilities and resources that cater to the local talent pool and make them accessible for existing and new clients. Our approach has always been to bridge the gap between incoming multinational firms and the local resource pool. However, recently many local organizations have started to avail these service and advisory offerings to streamline their operations and enhance their bandwidth. We hope to continue to add value to the local economy by providing innovative localization solutions while sourcing the best talent from offshore markets as and when necessary.</p><h4>What are your key recommendations for companies interested in setting up operations in the Kingdom?</h4><p>Saudi Arabia is the single-biggest market in the GCC region. There are strong and vibrant sectors opening up that offer immense potential for companies looking to do business here. The recent reforms have made the market more accessible for conducting business. Any company wanting to diversify its income portfolio in the MENA region needs to conduct a serious feasibility exercise into the Saudi market. Having the right information regarding the market, processes, and regulations is critical. Solid local partners and on-the-ground research are essential here. Our advice is to ensure companies filter through the noise and analyze their respective sectors thoroughly. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As a leading investment group in the food and retail sectors, what is the Savola's role in endorsing the national food security and sustainable resource management? </h4><p>The Savola Group has grown and evolved, crossing national borders and affecting millions of lives across the MENA region. It is investing strategically by focusing on the food and retail sectors. The group is leveraging its wide geographical outreach to influence economically and socially responsible behavioral change among its consumers and stakeholders. Therefore, Savola's sustainability efforts are integrated into our business strategy and linked to the group's core business objectives, competencies, and expertise in the food industry. By the same token, it is adopting the strategic objectives of Saudi Arabia's 2030 Vision, thus ensuring sustainable food security and optimizing the use of resources for the Kingdom. In responding to rising global concern over the 1.3 billion tons of food wasted annually, we introduced Negaderha, our own food waste management program. Offered by Savola World, the group's sustainability and CSR platform, we are working passionately to decrease food wastage on a national level by raising awareness about the threats it poses and by adopting internationally proven practices to drive behavioral change toward optimal food resource management. </p><h4>Can you tell us more about the Negaderha framework and objectives?</h4><p>The project works on conducting research to obtain an in-depth understanding of the drivers, actors, and volumes of food waste in Saudi Arabia and to put into action a plan and framework to create sustainable behavioral change with regards to food conservation and management based on the best international practices. Negaderha tackles food waste at different levels. Currently we are targeting two main segments of the society: households and the hotels, restaurants, and cafés (HORECA)  sector.<br>Is Negaderha interested in forming partnerships?<br>To effectively realize its goals, Negaderha is collaborating with several international and local organizations. Speaking of this, I would like to highlight our engagement with the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), through which Savola utilizes their technical expertise and garners the buy-in of regulators and enablers to scale its efforts on a national level. Negaderha has also collaborated with the Waste Resources Action Program (WRAP). Through this partnership, Negaderha aims to acquire a license to use WRAP's know-how, which includes strategic guidelines, frameworks, and specific tools and tips on food waste management. We have also built strategic local partnerships and signed MoUs with nearly 20 national NGOs that specialize in food waste management in the country. </p><h4>How does Negaderha achieve success in reaching its target audience?</h4><p>Regarding the household market, we provide diverse technical tips and tools that cover the full consumption cycle: grocery shopping, storage tips, portion planning, and leftover food tips and recipes. We have also conducted a number of promoted on-ground and digital campaigns to create better engagement and drive behavioral change within our target segments. Negaderha's main communication campaign falls within the month of Ramadan, which is associated with the most wasteful practices. The campaign aims to boost awareness of the cause and encourage the community to embrace and practice the technical methods provided by Negaderha. Our most recent digital Ramadan campaign achieved a stunning success by achieving outstanding social engagement and interaction. Correspondingly, Negaderha is also extending its efforts in the HORECA sector. </p><h4>How does food waste represent a threat to the nation? </h4><p>The staggering amount of food waste not only puts our food security at risk, but also spells out dire social, economic, and environmental consequences.  From an economic perspective, based on Negaderha's research, SAR70 million of food is wasted daily in Saudi Arabia. Furthermore, the country is at the top of world rankings for both importing and wasting food, with nearly 4 million tons thrown away every year, 28% of which is organic. This amounts to USD35 million worth of food every day, or USD13 billion per year. Realizing the amount of economic loss should propel a comprehensive national movement for change. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In what markets will the Jeddah Chamber promote trade in the near future?</h4><p>Most of the commercial markets have come under our attention, especially those serving investments in SMEs, which are considered to be the backbone of the private sector. They have always been keen to take care of the interests of their business and community members in order to improve the overall economy of the Kingdom, based on its vision of supporting the business sector and achieving sustainable economic development. It works to achieve its mission of optimizing investment in development, technology, and services to improve the quality of life through customer service, cooperation, excellence, efficiency, and transparency.</p><h4>How is Jeddah Chamber transforming its strategy to contribute to achieving the goals of Vision 2030?</h4><p>There is no doubt that the Kingdom's Vision 2030 is at the center of its strategic transformation, though the chamber has already witnessed many developments and expansions at the administrative and organizational levels to improve services for participants. One important highlight of the effort was its expansion into different governorates of the region to provide services to business owners in its Rabigh, Al-Laith, and Al-Qunfudah branches. The chamber has also launched the largest electronic project under the name of 'E- attestation,' the first of its kind among Saudi chambers, which allows the chamber's subscribers to ratify editors without the need to refer to the chamber. The chamber also supported the Kingdom's economic position when it launched the annual Jeddah Economic Forum in 2000, which soon became the Makkah Region Economic Forum, one of the most important economic events in the region. </p><h4>What measures does Jeddah Chamber take to encourage the private sector to invest in the region's economy?</h4><p>Jeddah Chamber encourages the private sector to provide quality services to its business owners by pioneering initiatives and development projects that add value to the national economy. At its 21st session, Jeddah Chamber adopted an ambitious strategic plan that represents a future perspective in line with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's vision 2030 and the National Transition Program 2020 by stimulating the performance of the private sector and enhancing its investment capabilities. In view of opportunities for economic and social development with an integrated and sustainable development vision of global standards, it left a strong message promoting quality services and institutional and human development. </p><h4>How can SMEs and entrepreneurs benefit from being part of Jeddah Chamber?</h4><p>SMEs represent an important segment of Jeddah Chamber's interest in supporting and developing its contribution to economic and social development by contributing to the creation of an appropriate and encouraging working environment to cooperate between the concerned parties in supporting and organizing SMEs. In order to spread a culture of entrepreneurship and develop a spirit of initiative and leadership among young people, it is leading a number of international programs directed at developing SMEs with the goal of enhancing competitiveness in the sector. </p><h4>How does Jeddah Chamber cooperate with other chambers to stimulate FDI in the Kingdom?</h4><p>Each year the chamber hosts a large volume of foreign delegations under the umbrella of the Council of Saudi Chambers, which focuses on overcoming difficulties faced by Saudi businesspeople and their counterparts from different countries. This plays a role in promoting mutual investment relations, increasing trade, and opening up prospects for investment that improve the diversity of the global economy.</p><h4>What events are you organizing for 2018-2019?</h4><p>The chamber's role in the Makkah Economic Forum is integral to our mission, though other events related to tourism, such as the Jeddah Summer Festival, are also key.  </p><h4>What changes is Jeddah Chamber proposing in order to further Saudization?</h4><p>The Saudization of jobs is an approach that the Kingdom has succeeded in creating numerous job opportunities for Saudi youth in various fields, and Jeddah Chamber is one of the leading chambers in this field. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[From Practice to Profession]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[from-practice-to-profession]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you envision developing the valuation profession in the country?</h4><p><span></span>Taqeem started three years ago as a regulator for the business valuation profession. Today, the Saudi market has become more transparent and is gaining more public trust. Before the regulation, valuation was a mere practice in Saudi Arabia, so realtors valued real estate and accountants valued businesses. It was mostly based on experience; there was no education and no standards for valuation. We established four goals to shift valuation from a practice to a profession. The first goal was to set valuation standards. Thus, we joined the International Valuation Standard Council (IVSC) and translated the International Valuation Standards (IVS) to be implemented in Saudi Arabia. It is our ambition to be the regional leader for Arab countries for the valuation profession. With one of our staff as a member of the Standard Committee, we have qualified valuation professionals who work with global experts to bring standards up to par. Second, we enforced the regulations for the business valuation profession. As a result, we worked with the government to implement standards across the board, which included requiring valuers to have licensing. This means that asset valuations are based on standards and principles rather than opinions. Furthermore, we have set a code of conduct for valuers. Third, we are committed to educating people about valuations. It is our goal to distribute the knowledge to the community that there is something called valuation, and that you have to go to a valuer, a trusted source, before making your decisions. Our fourth focus point is the standardization of valuation, which is something we are working on thoroughly. Half of the country's business is in real estate, including renting, selling, and investments, so these valuations should be based on standards and actual value rather than expert opinions. Similarly for IPOs, it is good when professionals issue valuation reports before decisions are taken.</p><h4>What fields of valuation are you currently prioritizing? </h4><p>Taqeem has various valuation designations, including accredited real estate valuer (AR Taqeem) and accredited business valuer (AB Taqeem), but currently most of our activities are in real estate. We have around 900 licensed real estate valuers. Our business valuation primarily looks into intangible assets. A lot of companies here do not realize the value of their trademark, name, or goodwill, so we are trying to show them that they have an actual value. Moreover, we have a program with the SME Authority to help companies understand the value of their businesses and tell them whether to raise or lower their expectations. As for automobile damage assessment, our goal now is to provide information on how much the insurance company should pay to repair a car. Valuers can independently establish a value that is fair for all parties involved. Furthermore, we started a new program for valuers to specialize in valuing SMEs. It is actually more challenging to value SMEs than big companies because they lack historical data, and the risk for the business in SMEs is higher than in well-established large companies.</p><h4>What is the purpose of Taqeem Academy in the practice of valuation?</h4><p>Taqeem Academy consulted many international institutions such as the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS), the National Institute of Valuation (INSPEN) in Malaysia, and the International Institute of Business Valuers (iiBV) to localize, translate, and deliver courses in Arabic. We have now graduated 32 Saudi nationals as internationally accredited business valuers. Women are also participating heavily in real estate and business valuation sectors. In automobile damage assessment, we cooperated with KPMG and Thatcham, a UK-based, non-profit research center. Thatcham is currently working with us to build our internationally approved curriculum. A fourth program is in machinery and equipment valuation related to factory product lines. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How can the Saudi labor market best absorb new talent, and what strategies should be put in place to capitalize on the country's demographic bonus?</h4><p>Almost 59% of Saudis are under the age of 30, and 49% are below 25, which means we are an extremely young country. Many are also now entering the labor market. Within  GASTAT, we have two teams working on this issue. The first provides statistics to the relevant entities, such as the Ministry of Civil Services, Ministry of Labor, and the Human Resources Development Fund (HRDF), which drafts our labor market policies. With our work, we can advance decision makers in the labor markets and give guidance on how to absorb the young population into the labor market. Our work has become more advanced: we include new indicators of job seekers such as their qualifications, age, and preferences, in addition to existing work visas and their division into the public and private sector. Furthermore, we classify these job seekers into regions, which, when combined with the other indicators, helps us provide the data for unemployment policy. As our work advances, we are also working to raise greater awareness on how to use our resources. This is not an obstacle unique to Saudi Arabia; every sophisticated institution across the globe is facing this problem. For example, not all ministries use our numbers, and that puts us under pressure to raise awareness of these services. Our counterpart in the Netherlands, for example, has a media program for its institutions, with detailed explanations of its research findings. We seek to launch a similar practice.</p><h4>What trends does your current research show with regards to the growth of non-oil sectors?</h4><p>We have evaluated our statistical products according to the international requirements set out by the World Bank and IMF and are currently developing a program to align our indicators more in line with international practices. For example, we need to make some of our figures quarterly rather than annually—GDP is now measured quarterly. Our job seeker indicator is also new. To measure the impact of Vision 2030 on the national economy, we are looking at 12 programs and developing our indicators accordingly. One of these new products was developed to support the Ministry of Housing to better serve the needs of the population in terms of housing development. In the recent years, and Vision 2030 has catalyzed this, we have tightened our collaboration with ministries and other government entities to better serve the public. Another new element is our focus on SMEs, and we are developing tools and products to serve them with better insights. We listen more to their needs and use their feedback in our research strategies. Since GASTAT became independent in 2016, we have significantly changed our way of working; we are now more proactive and treat government entities as VIP customers to better serve economic development.</p><h4>How can you serve international businesses and investors with your statistics?</h4><p>Within GASTAT, we have a team dealing with foreign investment. It closely collaborates with the Ministry of Commerce and Investment to develop the necessary indicators to measure economic growth and opportunities. It jointly consults with experts from the IMF, World Bank, and other renowned international institutions to satisfy the requirements for international businesses. A better alignment with global standards will make our data more presentable and comparable with the statistics of other countries, bring more transparency to international investors, and ultimately provide better opportunities. We are currently finalizing the new data set of top indicators for international investors.</p><h4>What notable trends in sustainable development goals (SDGs) have you observed?</h4><p><span></span>Certain SDGs are easier to track than othersm, and some indicators are easy to develop from surveying the data with well-known methodologies. For this, we plan to maximize those indicators and publish the progress made. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are Mashroat's primary project management activities and overall mandate? </h4><p>The National Project Management Office (NPMO) was announced by royal decree in September 2015 with the mandate to improve efficiency in the delivery of projects by adopting the best international project management practices, developing a project management approach for implementing the best international practices, setting criteria for the establishment of project management offices within government entities, and preparing a standard contract template for  government entities to engage project management companies. A subsequent royal decree issued in August 2017 extended the scope of the NPMO to include operations and maintenance, which resulted in changing our name to Mashroat. Our approach to realize this mandate is built on four pillars. The first is alignment and ensuring a more consistent and standard approach to the planning and execution of projects that reflects best international practices. These are captured in the Mashroat Projects White Book. The second pillar is enablement, namely supporting the restructuring of entities to be more capable and competent in the delivery of public infrastructure in line with our developed best practices. Third, we strive to provide the necessary support and resources, both people and training materials, to help entities adopt and implement the Mashroat methodology. Our last pillar is evaluation, for which we are developing a national projects dashboard to monitor project performance metrics and facilitate analysis of project performance in ways not currently possible, thereby providing greater transparency at different managerial levels.</p><h4>How is Mashroat equipped to provide the necessary training and consultations to these entities?</h4><p>We have captured our methodology in the Mashroat Projects White Book. This contains a complete and comprehensive set of processes, procedures, and templates for planning and execution of infrastructure projects across the entire project lifecycle. These materials have been informed, refined, and developed to reflect best international practices. We have been supported in these endeavors by Bechtel and are building Mashroat's capacity through a structured knowledge transfer program. All the materials developed by Mashroat to support its approach are available to government entities and their suppliers via a portal on our website. In total, this represents over 800 separate deliverables, which include 28 packs of training materials covering of project management, professional development, leadership development, and leading change. For government entities, our approach involves analyzing their projects portfolio and sitting down with them to understand how they deliver infrastructure projects. With this information, we provide support by advising them on organization and structures that reflect best international practices, and how they will facilitate more efficient and effective delivery of projects. In addition to this organizational support, we place enormous importance on the personal development of Saudi nationals. This will be realized through an entity-specific knowledge transfer program, whose objective is to support the entities to become more competent, capable, and self-sufficient over time.</p><h4>How do you interact with other organizations striving to make public entities more efficient and better equipped to deliver on their projects?</h4><p>There are many other organizations that have national responsibilities that touch on, or impact, Mashroat's activities. To reflect this importance, a key position in the organization is the director of external stakeholder management, who is responsible for engaging with these organizations to understand where we have common interests and how we can work together. Among the most important external organizations are the Ministry of Finance (MoF), the Bureau for Spending Rationalization (BSR), and the National Center for Performance Measurement (Adaa). Mashroat works closely with MoF and BSR to develop project appraisal processes and procedures that will be used to develop robust business cases for infrastructure projects. We have also developed a suite of procedures to support five-year project portfolio planning, and are working with BSR on the execution of an outreach program to support entities employing these methods. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your expectations for the Tayseer program, whose protection of property rights was designed to spur private sector investment?</h4><p>The Executive Committee was formed to improve business performance in the private sector in line with Saudi Vision 2030. The intent was to increase the competencies of relevant government services and place the Kingdom among the top countries in the world in terms of the ease of doing business. The Tayseer committee has been established to pursue four main objectives: increase the efficiency of government services; position Saudi Arabia among the top-20 countries globally for doing business; implement regulations aimed at stimulating private sector growth; and increase private sector engagement with direct involvement in decision making. Moreover, more than 100 additional reforms are on the list for approval and implementation. SAGIA is closely monitoring the challenges and obstacles facing both local and foreign investors and businesspeople. These bodies will study and provide recommendations for solutions and submit them to the Saudi Council of Economic and Development Affairs for discussion and approval.</p><h4>Your organization recently granted innovative licenses to 11 companies that enable young people to participate in the knowledge economy. How will you further drive the innovation economy and prepare young graduates for careers in the field?  </h4><p>Innovation is indispensable to doing business in today's world, and Vision 2030 clearly states that innovation and entrepreneurship are two key factors that will foster healthy economic development in the Kingdom. From food trucks to design firms and tech start-ups, young Saudi entrepreneurs are happily realizing the fruits of forming one's own business. Increased focus on e-commerce in the Kingdom also opens doors for young Saudi techies to create new products aimed at furthering digitization. To ease the transition from idea to marketplace, SAGIA now offers a special entrepreneur's license that makes setting up a company deemed “innovative" far easier than it used to be. A network of incubators and creative hubs also exists to nurture innovative entrepreneurs, and a loan program aimed at funding start-ups and SMEs is fully operational. </p><h4>Focus industries for increasing added-value include mining, renewable energy, manufacturing, automotive, pharmaceuticals, and electronics. How do these attract investments?  </h4><p>Coordinating with Vision 2030, nine sectors for investments have been identified as primary investment targets, many of which have fundamental value underpinned by the size of the Saudi, regional, and global markets. In order to attract high-value investments, we have determined a list of the most promising countries for every sector we are targeting, so as to acquire the best expertise, advanced technologies, and innovations in each field.</p><h4>Increasing FDI is a primary goal of Vision 2030. How will this affect the economy?</h4><p>Our economic objectives include raising FDI to 5.7% of GDP, and private sector contribution from 40% to 65% of GDP. Saudi's Vision 2030 is coming to fruition and has succeeded in placing the Kingdom among the top-10 countries worldwide in terms of the business environment, as indicated by a recent World Bank report on the protection of minority investors. This came as part of the reforms adopted by the government in accordance with the plans and objectives of Vision 2030 to make the Kingdom a unique global model across all levels. The most important thing that distinguishes Vision 2030 is that it has given the local and foreign private sector players special importance as a key partner in accomplishing its objectives. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has allocated billions of dollars to the private sector for its development in accordance with Saudi Vision 2030 and the National Transformation Program 2020. The most important program is the Public Investment Fund (PIF), the engine for diversifying the Kingdom's economy. The Kingdom's privatization programs are a top priority and have already begun in the ministries of Industry and Mineral Resources, Labor and Social Development, Housing, Education, Municipal and Rural Affairs, Telecommunications and Information Technology, and Hajj and Umrah. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are Riyadh's most significant assets as it seeks to become a global economic center?</h4><p>Riyadh is the vibrant capital of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which is the largest economy in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). Its strategic location at the heart of Saudi Arabia offers it considerable advantages including access to markets across MENA, Europe, and rapidly developing Africa and Asia. Riyadh today has a population of 6.5 million people. Most are young, with 35% of the population under 15 years of age. What's more, our new generation is among the most educated and technologically savvy people in the region. Riyadh has a vision to be among the best 100 cities in the world by 2030. Realization of this vision is ongoing through many planning and strategic initiatives across all sectors. This includes an ambitious strategy for the redevelopment of the historic core of the city (1,500ha) in partnership with the Kingdom's Public Investment Fund (PIF). Furthermore, we are developing major parks and environmental projects, such as the prize-winning Wadi Hanifah restoration and the restoration of historic Addiriyah, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. These restorations will help make Riyadh a liveable city that celebrates its rich heritage and history. To enhance our infrastructure, we are working on the King Abdulaziz Public Transport Project, which involves a 176-km metro system with six lines and 85 stations supported by an extensive new bus network. King Khalid International Airport has also been renewed and expanded. To link Riyadh with other regions in the Kingdom, we launched new national railway projects with Riyadh as the hub. This includes the new Saudi Land Bridge project that will provide a rail link between Jeddah and Riyadh and onward to the Arabian Gulf coast, using the existing railway lines. Recently, we inaugurated the 2,750-km railroad linking the capital to Majma'a, Qassim, Hail, Aljawf, and Qurayyat. Riyadh is the headquarters of the country's commercial banks and encompasses the King Abdullah Financial Centre, which will house the headquarters of CMA, financial corporations and banks, offices of legal accountants, lawyers and financial advisory services, the classification authorities, and providers of technological services. The capital academy for financial specializations and courses will also be established here. Riyadh is also being transformed under an ambitious project to build digital connectivity with ITC infrastructure, creating Smart Riyadh. We are now a technology cluster, with leading institutes specializing in nano-technology and energy—including nuclear and renewable energy—as well as the Riyadh Techno-Valley project and the Information and Telecommunications Technology Complex (IITC). There are two industrial cities in Riyadh and a third under construction, with outlying industrial cities being developed elsewhere in Riyadh province. Education and health services are leading parts of Riyadh's assets, where excellent services are available for the city's population and for visitors, making Riyadh a hub for such services in the region. A key goal of Vision 2030 is creating private sector jobs and reducing the economy's dependency on oil through diversification. Riyadh's sophisticated and modern infrastructure, available investment capital, strategic location, and human resources are all propelling investment and industrial growth in new directions. However, Riyadh's major asset remains its people: well educated, well travelled, welcoming, family oriented, and willing to accept and embrace change and modernization in all aspects of life.</p><h4>How do you envision the future of Riyadh city?</h4><p>A city of prosperity by nature of its competitive advantages, it will be a contemporary oasis in harmony with its desert environment, attracting domestic and foreign investment. The vision is also for Riyadh to be a global center of innovation in scientific research and development and a leader in energy, desert environment technologies, health sciences, and education. A driving principle of Riyadh's vision is to achieve sustainability in the future planning of the city within Islamic principles, which include the obligation of citizens to help create a city not just for its current citizens, but also for future generations. </p>]]></richbody0content>

Facilitating and easing practicing business is one of the most important objectives of the Trade and Investment System, whose aim is to make the Kingdom one of the top 10 countries in the Global Competitiveness Index according to the World Economic Forum. It also aims to enhance the Kingdom's economic position by improving the business environment and raising the economic evaluation in accordance with the World Bank's report on the ease of doing business. We are also working to increase SMEs' economic contribution as key drivers of economic development and diversity. The goal is for them to contribute 35% to GDP by 2030, in addition to creating job opportunities, supporting innovation, and boosting exports.</p><h4>What are your primary objectives for the coming years? </h4><p>The Trade and Investment System is working on a number of initiatives that fall within the objectives of the National Transformation Program 2020 and Vision 2030. The most important of these is the facilitation of practicing and starting up a business, improving and developing the retail sector through the improvement of the quality of stores, having automation in their work, and endeavoring to raise SMEs' contribution to GDP, in addition to attracting direct and value-added foreign investments. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How can Saudi Arabia capitalize on its young population regarding economic transformation?</h4><p>As His Royal Highness the Crown Prince mentioned, although we are a resource-rich country, our real wealth is our youth. Being a young nation is a strong enabler for economic growth, but to harness this advantage and reap the benefits of the country's demographic characteristics we must focus on education, job creation and access to employment opportunities and the provision of quality healthcare services.  <br>Regarding education, we are focused on equipping our youth with high-quality education aligned with market needs which will enable the population to be active contributors to economic growth. As for employment opportunities, there are also a number of improvements in this area. Labor market reforms focus on addressing segmentation, improving labor mobility, addressing the wage gap, tackling obstacles to SME development and reducing barriers to female labor force participation. Efforts around female labor force participation include mobility, suitable working environments and equitable investments in women compared to male peers. Regarding SMEs, fostering an entrepreneurial culture will increase employment opportunities and nurture innovation. In essence, a skilled labor force with access to productive jobs will facilitate sustainable economic growth. </p><h4>What role should the government play in further diversifying away from the oil industry?</h4><p>Economic diversification is a top policy priority. The government is developing a framework that identifies areas where our comparative advantages can be best realized. One example is the National Industrial Development and Logistics Program, which aims to transform Saudi Arabia into a regional industrial powerhouse and logistics hub. This strategy is complemented by efforts to strengthen the business environment and increase its attractiveness to local and international entrepreneurs. <br>Achieving these goals entails the implementation of coherent, consistent and transparent policies and regulations that foster economic growth and diversification including removing obstacles to productivity and competitiveness. We aim to improve the structure, depth, and interconnectedness of the economy to better integrate Saudi Arabia into the global economy and attract the right investments.<br>The government continues to build and invest in infrastructure as quality infrastructure facilitates private sector activity and enables growth. Also, the government placed human capital development atop the policy agenda. Evidence shows that human capital investments during one's early years of life lay a strong foundation for adult prosperity and the growth, diversification and competitiveness of economies. Investing in people through nutrition, healthcare, quality education, jobs and skills will help build the human capital needed to realize our goals of economic diversification and sustainability. </p><h4>What are your priorities for the coming years?</h4><p>While the ministry continues to play a significant role in the realization of Vision 2030 and the National Transformation Program, we seek to develop greater topical and analytical expertise to better support the Vision and its Realization Programs. Strengthening policy research and analysis will better position us to support the evolving and complex policy environment. We aim to add greater empiricism and evidence to the policy formulation process in areas the ministry is focused on. <br>A crucial success factor is engagement with key stakeholders within and beyond government including the private sector and NGOs. We are working alongside our partners to innovate policy design and implementation. </p><h4>How do you envision the ministry's planning and coordination roles going forward? </h4><p>Economic planning and policy coordination have been given new meaning in Saudi Arabia. The role of the ministry has grown and evolved beyond its original mandate. Long-term planning is essential, but the policy landscape requires that planning be coupled with support that is dynamic, analytical and grounded in methods that yield an evidence-based approach to policy making. Our envisioned role entails the use of data driven methods and approaches to highlight interdependencies across policy areas to ensure an evidence-based approach to policy design and implementation; the facilitation of a rich and nuanced dialogue alongside key stakeholders to better design and implement policies; better coordinated policy efforts across ministries to prevent duplication of efforts and the use of impact assessment tools to evaluate policy and program efficiency and effectiveness to better inform resource allocation. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Digital Momentum]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[digital-momentum]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is e-commerce changing consumer behavior in the Middle East?</h4><p>The entire digital cycle is changing consumer behavior, and our customers are becoming more and more digitalized. We have to determine how to connect with our customers in the best and most relevant way. E-commerce is moving with momentum, but seeing our customers choose between purchasing online over offline is driving our strategy. E-commerce in the luxury segment grew exponentially in 2016 and accelerated significantly in 2017. We see that acceleration continuing for the next few years. A lot of the issues we are facing online are also being solved online, such as the payments, logistics, and engaging with the customer. By getting over these hurdles, and with the arrival of larger players on the market, there will be greater momentum created in the e-commerce space. We reached 3-4% of the market in 2017, and we hope to go up to 12% of the market in 2020.</p><h4>In what way do you expect the consumer profile to evolve in 2018?</h4><p>Dubai is a fantastic hub formed by local residents as well as regional and international tourists. In 2017, we saw enormous change on the tourist front. The numbers are growing by 7-8%; however, we see less people from the GCC. Instead, we are seeing more people from India with a different consumption pattern; also, there are more Russians and Chinese, who are not buying a lot of luxury items. Another growing source market is Africa. For us, tourists are our key customers in our brick-and-mortar stores. Still, we have to adapt to the changing profile of tourists. Fashion, too, is changing constantly. On the local front, we have witnessed purchasing power being affected by new norms. No matter what the age, consumers are shifting toward a more playful shopping style; shopping for themselves instead of others and inspired by different types of people, not only by the way the brand talks to them, but also how they talk to each other via social media. Part of our job is to adapt to this new mindset.</p><h4>To what extent has Dubai's retail sector reached saturation?</h4><p>There are a few cities in the world that will eventually grab a larger share of the world retail market, and Dubai will continue to be one of them. These cities will be labeled “retail cities" that offer a certain vibrancy or experience. It is our duty as retailers to ensure we remain in the right position and that we provide vibrancy and differentiation. The point of differentiation is especially key because having too much of the same thing can be problematic. Developers, too, need to innovate and offer a different experience. If we can offer something different that makes people genuinely excited about Dubai as a retail city, making it interesting to move and browse around, then it will be a huge plus in making the city even more relevant. We truly need to make sure we offer something special.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the retail sector in 2018?</h4><p>I expect it will be tough and challenging. The arrival of VAT and its psychological effect will impact us. Costs will still be rising while we do not expect a major increase in business. Having said that, when we see the budget of the UAE, and Dubai in particular, we feel that the government is injecting money into the system that will help. We will probably see the effect of it at a later stage during the year. We feel that it is a sensible move because, in order to make the economy dynamic, one has to spend more to turn more revenue. This is what we believe is happening today. I am more optimistic about 2H2018. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main accomplishments and milestones for DDF in the past year?</h4><p>2017 was the highest-selling year in our history, with sales amounting to USD1.93 billion. We sold 73 million pieces of merchandise, with 27 million transactions on our registers. Our penetration rate is the highest in the world, and our sales per capita is near the top of global rankings as well. In 2016, we opened Concourse D, which handles all the airlines that go through Dubai International Airport other than Emirates Airlines. Concourse D accounts for about 20% of our business; it is an attractive area, enticing passengers to come there. We are budgeting higher than 2017 for 2018; our first quarter sales reached over USD523 million, representing an 11% increase over the same period last year. Concourse C is being refurbished at the moment, and we will open new outlets there, with half already completed and the remainder to be done throughout 2018. At Al Maktoum International Airport, we have increased our retail space from 2,500sqm to 4,500sqm. Some new airlines, including Azur Air from Russia, fly there, and we are optimistic about the coming year.</p><h4>How do you assess the importance of your marketing campaigns and sports sponsorships?</h4><p>Our campaigns are unique and give us exposure in different ways. We do not just organize tennis just for tennis fans but as a promotion for DDF, and we assess the value of it. Our tennis tournaments in 2017 were valued at USD920 million in media coverage to Dubai. We spend 2.5% of our top line on advertising, marketing, and promoting DDF, which is considerably more than what any other duty free spends, and it pays dividends. Several years ago Dubai Airport won an award, and the customers who voted for Dubai were surveyed on why they voted for Dubai Airport. 90% responded that it was because of DDF. It is important to market our services and sponsor events locally. For every event that is held in Dubai, people fly in and fly out and they pass by DDF, so we are a big supporter of many events in Dubai. In addition to tennis tournaments, we have been a partner and sponsor of the Omega Dubai Desert Classic Golf since it started 26 years ago; we support the Dubai Duty Free Irish Derby in Ireland and have been sponsoring horse racing in Newbury in the UK for the past 22 years. We also sponsor the DDF Shergar Cup in Ascot every year; this is all about tapping into different markets. Three years ago we took on the title sponsorship of the Dubai Duty Free Irish Open Golf. This event is huge in Ireland, and the value that the European Tour gave us in 2017 was USD161 million in media coverage.</p><h4>How do you see the impact of e-commerce on the retail sector, and what opportunities and challenges does it entail for DDF?<br></h4><p>E-commerce is necessary, though it does not significantly affect travel. It is a special treat for many passengers to go through a retail area at the airport and buy at great value. Still, we have to be aware of e-commerce, and we set up a click-and-collect operation in DDF two years ago. In 2017, our sales were USD19 million, and it is uncertain if these sales are on top of regular sales or merely a replacement. It is a service that we provide that will always be small in comparison to our total business. The main feature will remain people shopping personally at the airport buying gifts at great value. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Is Dubai on track to reach the target of 20 million visitors by 2020?</h4><p>Despite a challenging year for the global travel industry, Dubai has seen significant growth. In fact, in 2017 our growth rate was 6.2%, reaching 15.8 million visitors, and we welcomed 4.7 million tourists in 1Q2018 with a 2% increase in traffic. We are well on our way to achieving our target of 20 million visitors by 2020. We are now present in 41 countries and are actively interacting with people who engage with Dubai content, especially since we own and manage over 100 social media channels and drive engagement in over 20 languages. Our target is to not only increase the number of visitors, but also the length of stays. Lately, we have been focusing on making sure people realize the depth of the options and opportunities to explore the city, looking beyond the most familiar landmarks by highlighting new attractions and experiences across diverse areas including history and heritage, and cultural spots related to arts and fashion. Dubai has always been a trendsetter in the region when it comes to fashion and retail, and we have amplified that in our marketing communications. Another key factor that we are taking advantage of is the easing of visa regulations. Dubai currently offers visas on arrival for citizens of 50 different countries including Russia and China, two of our main source markets. Moreover, the UAE has extended visas-on-arrival to Indian nationals with a valid American visa or Green Card, which should encourage even more visitors from India to choose Dubai.</p><h4>What are the key trends that Dubai's tourism and hospitality sector needs to address to stay ahead of the curve?</h4><p>The quality of hotels, rooms, and facilities in Dubai are second to none. The same goes for the level of service and staff friendliness. The next level would be to have them even more thoroughly trained about what the city has to offer. Dubai Tourism has taken the lead in empowering staff with such knowledge with the “Dubai Way" initiative launched by our Dubai College of Tourism. This is a training program designed to give tourist-facing staff such as those employed at hotels, airlines, airports, malls, transportation systems, and theme parks the opportunity to expand their knowledge of the Emirate and its tourism industry as well as improving their guest relations and service skills. However, the entire city of Dubai has a role to play. We would like everyone who calls Dubai home to be advocates of the city.</p><h4>How do you forecast the impact of Expo 2020 on tourism in Dubai?</h4><p>Expo 2020 is a landmark event for Dubai and especially for its tourism industry as it opens up many opportunities in terms of investment, infrastructure development, and the promotion of the city to thousands of new visitors. The fact that Dubai was awarded Expo 2020 is also a reflection of Dubai's capability to host mega events. Dubai has earned itself an international reputation as a must-visit tourist destination for the diversity of value offerings and experiences that tourists are able to enjoy. The Emirate's strategic geographic location on the crossroads of East and West provides accessibility to two-thirds of the world's population within a flight time of eight hours. On top of this, we have excellent air connectivity from Dubai International Airport and simplified immigration procedures. As the home base of Dubai's international airlines, Emirates and flydubai, Dubai International Airport facilitates a vast network of airlines that together operate flights to over 240 international destinations. Furthermore, as the fourth-most-popular destination in the world on the MasterCard Global Destinations Cities Index, Expo 2020 also helps us highlight Dubai's quality facilities and amenities. </p>]]></richbody0content>

We have more than 25,000 students of 150 nationalities, with 27 international and local universities offering 487 degrees. In 2017, we announced the launch of four leading universities at DIAC: Curtin University (Australia), University of Birmingham (UK), Abu Dhabi University, and United Arab Emirates University. We also began construction on a new campus for University of Wollongong in Dubai, a testament to the growth of the international higher education sector in Dubai. As part of our efforts to ensure our students succeed in an increasingly competitive world, we consistently seek outstanding academic partners to complement our diverse higher education community. We ensure that these universities offer programs suited to the demands of the region and aim to build a community that shares best practices. We also host regular events and activities such as the DIAC Sports Festival, DIAC Career Fair, and our DIAC Open Day. One major initiative that stood out in 2017 was our partnership with BMI Media, an education event management company. We recently partnered with them to launch a market research study, titled, “Transnational Student Mobility and Future Employment Trends in 2017." The objective of the study was to provide a better understanding of international student needs and future employment preferences across a wide selection of developing countries in the GCC, Asia, and South America. This study provided a roadmap for international universities looking to attract international students from developing nations. It is through these types of initiatives that we aim to innovate and best prepare our academic partners for the demands and trends in the higher education sector.</p><h4>What significant synergies are there between the two free zones?</h4><p>Between DIAC and DKP, we cover most of the higher education lifecycle, from higher education through to training, vocational education, and continued learning and development. Education and human resources are often paired together as these two industries share many synergies. DIAC and DKP are part of the larger TECOM Group, which includes various other business parks focused on sectors such as ICT and media, and as such, the most important component for any sector is human resources. DKP was founded to cater to the requirements of these sectors by developing, talent, skills, and capabilities that other sectors need; it is the only HR free zone in the world. Coupled with the integrated entrepreneurial innovation platform in5, as well as legislation that allows students to work part time, the education experience offered by DIAC is highly integrated and applicable, giving students the right exposure and experience to succeed in an increasingly competitive world in the long term. We also explore the synergies between higher education and vocational training. Amongst our partners at DIAC and DKP, I believe we offer the appropriate training and education to fulfill the major training and business requirements needed by the local and regional economy.</p><h4>What trends do you see in your sector?</h4><p>One trend we are seeing worldwide is the rise of and demand for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) subjects. I believe our universities are heading in the right direction by offering programs that meet the demand for qualified graduates especially in the fields of AI, engineering, and automation. Universities also need to look into entrepreneurship. More people are now moving away from working for the government; they want to work in the private or semi-private sectors because they see the potential for growth and to expand their knowledge. Another trend we noticed from our DIAC market research study is that international students are looking for degrees and activities that actively provide the students with employment opportunities. Students recognize that international higher education is a significant investment and expect returns on this investment. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Quality, Access, and Engagement]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[quality-access-and-engagement]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the education landscape in Dubai developing?</h4><p>The development of education in Dubai has been both a social and an economic development agenda for us. KHDA started 10 years ago with a focus on quality, access, and community engagement. In the last five to six years, around 60 schools have opened their doors, with a record of 15 in 2017. As capacity increases, quality improves and the marketplace gives more value to parents. On the engagement level, we have been working with schools to engage them not only with KHDA but also with each other. These are schools with 17 different curriculums and teachers from 120 nations around the world, and Dubai is a great platform for collaboration in education. KHDA meets with schools, universities, training centers, and investors around the world to share Dubai's progress and to encourage them to be a part of that. We discuss the education systems and what Dubai can offer them, and we explain the processes involved in establishing themselves here. We work hand-in-hand with these investors to share market data, trends, and future forecasts, as well as support them to refine their business plans. Then, we proceed with the permission to open. As more schools open up, quality will improve even further.</p><h4>What are the main trends and developments that are further shaping the education sector?</h4><p>Technology has had an enormous impact on almost all industries, and when it comes to the social sectors like health, education, and social services, we are still in the beginning phase. Children are deeply involved in technology and the system is playing catch-up. We do not know yet what role disruptive developments will play, though I expect disruption to come from outside the system and will be mainly driven by the learners themselves.</p><h4>How do you assess the need for investment in the infrastructure of Dubai's education system, both in terms of facilities and human capital?</h4><p>In 2017, 15 schools opened, and we are looking at 12 more schools in 2018. Both local and international universities are also opening here. In 2018, we added two universities to our international list: Curtin University from Australia and the University of Birmingham from the UK. Our system is extremely international, and our teachers come to Dubai from many different places, the usual ones being India, the UK, Arab countries, and Europe. Dubai, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Shanghai are the preferred places for international teachers, with Dubai having the biggest demand and attracting the best teachers. The infrastructure of Dubai's education system, both in terms of facilities and staff, is improving every year. The rapid growth of Dubai's education system is not based on government investment, like in many other places. On the contrary, investors invest in schools and continue to establish new ones. They are looking at what the city is gearing up for: the huge investments in infrastructure and the Emirate's ambitious vision. They see it is attractive to invest in education to keep up with future demand.</p><h4>How can the education system become a better foundation for innovative entrepreneurship?</h4><p>The system of today is a system that trains students for a life full of tests, but we are looking for an approach that prepares students for the tests of life. This is where well-being becomes important; it is great if students are passing science and mathematics exams—but what happens when they start work and university and they come up against failure? What personal resources do they have that they can call upon when they feel lonely or stressed, and how do our children learn to live in harmony with each other? Our current education sector should be able to answer such questions to make sure that we are really giving our children the best start in life. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the most important advantages of having Dubai as a regional base for Medtronic?</h4><p>It has been a great journey for us, the whole process of which was triggered by the talent we were able to acquire within Dubai. Dubai has provided a platform that allows us to easily communicate and engage with the healthcare programs around the region by being a hub that attracts many visitors and innovative solutions. The maturity of thinking about healthcare issues within the public and private sectors is among the best across the region, and we learned a great deal through these interactions. Through its location in the heart of the emerging markets, Dubai helps us in ensuring we connect and contribute to the healthcare trends across the region.</p><h4>How do you partner with governmental health institutions in Dubai?</h4><p>We have been discussing with the healthcare authorities across the UAE and the Ministry of Health on multiple programs. These programs are focused on improving the quality of care for patients, delivering the latest technologies, and awareness programs. Having said that, Medtronic is also shifting from being a company that produces some of the world's best technologies in healthcare to a partner that ensures the delivery of these technologies is meaningful. The idea is that patients get the best technologies in the most efficient environment. Our aim is to improve patient outcome through controlled costs and improved accessibility to therapies without compromising on quality. Penetration rates and accessibility for patients are still at an initial stage, and there is a great deal more to happen. That expansion eventually means more spending and pressure on the budget. Governments and hospitals depend on partners like us to not only produce the technology and the device itself, which has a clinical output value, but also to help them maintain an efficient process around the patient flows, patient recovery times, inventory availability, and so on. In this way, additional budgets can have the largest impact on the public. At the moment, the major challenge is to raise the standards of healthcare and improve accessibility without increasing costs, or rather while reducing the overall costs of care. Medtronic can meaningfully address this challenge, and we are driving toward what is called value-based healthcare in collaboration with the Dubai Health Authority and certain hospital chains.</p><h4>What are the most important trends and developments in the healthcare industry?<br></h4><p>Certain trends in the region have been to make the system more accessible, build more hospitals and increase bed capacity, and attract more talent from outside the country to address some of the clear challenges across the entire region. When we look at bed capacity and the number of patients per physician, these capacities are much lower than what we see in a European or North American system. In addition, the standard of care still lags behind. The scarcity of physicians is one of the challenges this region faces, therefore it is important to see a higher output per physician than we see in a European or North American setting. Medtronic has had some programs in major countries around the region where we work together to improve the patient flow and the number of patients treated per bed or per physician. The region should now relook at its entire healthcare system and learn from the lessons of mature systems in Europe and the US. We need to build infrastructure; however, if we want to treat double the number of patients, we do not necessarily need to double the number of beds and hospitals. The efficiency of the system could be enhanced, for example by establishing centers of excellence, with high expertise in one location that can elevate everyone's skillsets. There will always be a need for certain general hospitals, though by establishing more centers of excellence, for example cardiology, obesity, or diabetes, their impact and efficiency will be higher. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[multiple-products-multiple-geographies]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the company developed in the past year?</h4><p>2017 was a kinder year than 2016, albeit it was still somewhat challenging. Certain products started to reflect a proper takeoff after launching in different markets. Understandably, it is a complex undertaking to launch multiple products in multiple geographies one after the other in a short time span. Overall, our specialty business is doing well in the areas where we compete. NewBridge's business model is to create value for the brands we represent in the region, whose manufacturers do not want to enter the region themselves but want to do it through a competent partner. NewBridge is positioned to be a regional platform that brings innovation to all MENA markets as a one-stop solution and, hence, was chosen as MENA partner of choice by many global pharma companies. We built a company that mimics multinationals, but on a smaller and nimbler scale. We created the structure, assets, and balance sheets, and filled a gap to attract these partners. This quickly created a name for us regionally and internationally. The core of our success is still within the GCC markets, and our focus remains there. However, we are currently expanding to other markets. </p><h4>What would you like to see from regulators to help pharma start-ups succeed in Dubai?</h4><p>The Dubai government has a progressive vision for the future, and as such, the UAE is ahead of the pack among other countries in MENA. Dubai has taken the lead in being creative, innovative, and aggressive in its pursuit of strategic advancement, and the results are obvious. It is the hub of all the major businesses in the Middle East. One of the things that I would like to see is more alignment regarding support for SMEs in the UAE. While there is a strong will and drive by governments, some sectors do not follow suit. Banks, for example, are not fully engaged in supporting SMEs. From a healthcare standpoint, there are certain areas that need to be addressed, such as how regulators look at SMEs compared to large companies in the sector. Innovations do not come only from large global companies; they also come from smaller companies that do not see MENA as a core priority but prefer to partner with a strong partner that can manage new products and innovations. NewBridge Pharmaceuticals is a vehicle to bring key innovations and products that may address serious medical needs in the Middle East. You need compliance, quality and pharmacovigilance systems in place. You need medical, commercial, marketing, and regulatory capabilities. You need a serious company with a clear vision and purpose, as well as serious processes and talents that can be entrusted to cater for these brands and provide the physicians with new modalities of treatments in our specializations. We are doing something positive because we bring important medication to the region.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the upcoming year?</h4><p>I would like to see oil prices stabilizing, which would reflect in more solid and stable economies in the countries where we operate. Moreover, I would like to see us increase access to the medicines we bring, reach more patients in need, and create greater value for our brands and shareholders. We have a great international network to access innovations and will continue to be successful in bringing significant, innovative medicines moving forward. Already, we have started to see interest from larger companies in the service space becoming interested in partnering with us. At some point, NewBridge might become part of a larger group or company in the future. We are also considering smaller acquisitions to provide more value in this space. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How far along is the integration of Al Noor Group into Mediclinic's structure?</h4><p>Approximately 18 months ago we acquired the Al Noor group in Abu Dhabi, making us one of the largest healthcare providers across the UAE, with facilities in Abu Dhabi, Al Ain, the Western Region, and Dubai. We spent most of the year working on that integration. There were many challenges during that phase, most especially the sudden changes within the regulatory framework. The economy across the UAE is not growing as it used to during the boom years of 2011-2014. Despite the challenges of living within the constraints of the new oil price, we have confidence in the future of the UAE and are still growing. In Dubai, we opened our comprehensive cancer center in September 2016, which has been performing ahead of expectations since then.</p><h4>What are the differences between the regulatory framework in Abu Dhabi and Dubai?</h4><p>In Dubai, the regulator, on top of setting policy, also manages the government hospitals. They are not really growing these hospitals, as they want the private sector to invest and take on this responsibility, so they support the private sector and competition through policy. The insurance sector is also competitive. When mandatory health insurance was introduced in Dubai, there were initially seven providers that could provide the basic package to the market, whereas in Abu Dhabi there is just the one provider. This means that this one provider comprises two-thirds of the market. The rest of the companies are fighting for that remaining one-third, so it is not as competitive as Dubai. In Abu Dhabi, the regulator also sets policy but does not operate the public hospitals directly, and thus, the onus is not left to the private sector to take on this responsibility.</p><h4>What effect does medical tourism in the region have on your business?</h4><p>The statistics for medical tourism can be misleading. For example, emergency room visits from a normal tourist could be considered as medical tourism, so statistics need to be read in context. There is a medical tourism visa now available for healthcare specifically, and there is potential for growth in the medium to long term. It is important to understand that medical tourism includes three deciding factors for patients. Firstly, the person does not have access to such services in their home countries. Second, the quality of facilities in the source country is not as required. And third, people are looking for healthcare at a cheaper price. When it comes to price, the UAE cannot compete with lower income countries such as India and Thailand, but we can compete on quality.</p><h4>In what areas do you see the most potential for growth?</h4><p>Whilst the healthcare spend per capita is fairly high at USD2,200 per capita, the UAE is a high-income country. Expenditure on healthcare in the UAE is actually still fairly low as its percentage of GDP sits at around 3.5%. That will inevitably increase over time as quality improves and less people travel abroad for their healthcare needs. Also, there is an ever-ageing population, and the burden of disease is increasing with an increasing prevalence of diabetes, obesity, heart disease, and cancer. All of these factors will hike up the cost of healthcare and required expenditure over time.</p><h4>What are the most important trends you see coming into healthcare?</h4><p>The regulations will increase, and I hope that there will be a larger focus on ethics and the subsequent cost of over-utilization. Improved technology, especially artificial intelligence, will also make a more significant impact on services within healthcare. The patient to doctor relationship will also change; we will have mobile health such as video and telephonic appointments, and wearables will become a more significant part of healthcare monitoring. Healthcare is an exciting and an ever-changing environment, and the UAE is at the forefront of these changes. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What kinds of companies have settled in Dubai Healthcare City?</h4><p>Since its launch in 2002 by HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister, and Ruler of Dubai, Dubai Healthcare City has aspired to achieve its vision of becoming an internationally recognized destination for quality healthcare and wellness. DHCC is home to more than 400 clinical and non-clinical facilities as well as medical education institutions. DHCC Phase I, occupying an area of 4 million sqft, is home to the Mohammed bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences (MBRU), which has become a pioneer in the UAE's medical and higher education fields. Phase I is also home to three general hospitals, including the free zone's first digital hospital, Dr Sulaiman Al Habib Hospital and the Emirates Specialty Hospital. Dubai's most advanced facility for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, Mediclinic City Hospital's Comprehensive Cancer Centre, is also operating out of DHCC Phase I. In addition, the free zone is home to Al Jalila Children's Specialty Hospital, the first dedicated children's hospital in the UAE, and to regional headquarters of multinational companies. In Phase II, a 17-million sqft area is dedicated to wellness and preventive medicine. The masterplan for Phase II incorporates specialized health and wellness facilities, residences, retail, hospitality, and leisure components. To date, we have over 40% of the masterplan dedicated to committed projects. The Swiss International Scientific School in Dubai (SISD), Dubai's first-ever private school to offer multilingual education is already operating out of Phase II.</p><h4>What advantages do you offer to the companies that settle in DHCC Free Zone?</h4><p>The reasons we are able to attract regional and multinational medical and pharmaceutical companies to DHCC Free Zone are that transactions are easy and cost effective. We have 100% freehold benefits here at DHCC. Our one-stop shop gives us a competitive edge. We are able to manage all transactions around setting up a company. You can get your medical and commercial licenses from DHCR, do your medical fitness test for your visa, and get your national ID here. Entities that set up in DHCC do not need to visit any other government body separately to get approvals. This makes the process much faster, easier, and more convenient, which is why it attracts more business.</p><h4>How do you intend to attract more medical tourists to Dubai?</h4><p>There are many approaches to attracting medical tourists. One is a price mix theory, which offers treatment at a low cost, which attracts patients. The second school of thought is to provide the best quality treatment to attract medical tourists. Others go for a niche strategy, targeting patients from specific countries. Another strategy is developing a culture of medical tourism. This makes patients feel welcome and relaxed, and they go home feeling better. All of these different strategies have proved to be successful. The Dubai government has decided to adopt a mixture of these approaches. In DHCC, we are looking to strengthen quality care with a focus on certain specialties. For example, we have Dubai's most advanced facility for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, Mediclinic City Hospital's Comprehensive Cancer Centre and ophthalmology services provided by renowned providers such as Moorfields Eye Hospital. We also have several diabetes and wellness treatments here.</p><h4>What are your plans for 2018?</h4><p>We are focusing on Phase II of DHCC on the concept of wellness and preventive medicine. We are bringing more investors in now to work on developing wellness offerings. We are also focusing on children's and elderly healthcare. To some extent we also want to work on the different elements of rehabilitation. Development in Phase II for its first general hospital—the Clemenceau Medical Center—is underway and will expand our range of specialized care. The upcoming 110-bed hospital will have advances such as robotic surgery and wide-ranging inpatient and outpatient services. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role will innovation and technological advancements such as artificial intelligence (AI) play in the development of Dubai's healthcare sector? </h4><p>Innovation and technological developments will increasingly play a significant role in creating a patient-centered health system. If we look at the role of 3D printing in healthcare, it has revolutionized the industry. Today, as a result of 3D printed prosthetics, amputees have their lives transformed for the better as the prosthetics provide them with the maximum feeling of anatomical function. Similarly, doctors can perform complex surgeries with utmost precision using 3D printed models. Moreover, the technology is cost-effective, which makes it affordable across a wide spectrum of patients who need it. The DHA has seen these developments first-hand since we began using this technology nearly two years ago. We are working closely with the Dubai Future Foundation to bring to life the Emirate's vision of harnessing modern technology to improve lives. In AI, we are working closely with world-class companies that are implementing AI in various fields to see how we can utilize these services in the healthcare landscape of Dubai. We are in the process of building an innovation center and are working with the private sector to establish the most suitable model. Innovation cannot take place in isolation and instead thrives on collaboration; we are keen to work with innovators, healthcare entities, scientists and researchers to improve healthcare outcomes and patient experience. </p><h4>What other healthcare trends do you foresee in the upcoming years?</h4><p>I foresee a rise in the UAE's population and a higher percentage of geriatric population, which means we need to create holistic services for the elderly and ensure sound capacity planning to meet the needs of an increasing population. I reckon there will be automated care at hospital set-ups due to emerging technologies, which will improve efficiency. At the same time, we can already see the emergence of precision medicine and personalized care, especially as technology such as genetic testing becomes cost-effective. Improvements in healthcare fueled by technology will allow more accurate diagnostics, better data collection, and integrated care. Patients will be empowered with knowledge due to smart technologies such as wearable devices that can track their fitness. They will be more engaged and knowledgeable in the management of their own health, enhancing preventive care measures. Employers will focus on wellness programs as health and wellness begins to take center stage. In the coming years, I anticipate a greater focus on outpatient care, preventive care, and precision medicine. A great deal of the care and follow-up currently done in hospitals and healthcare settings will move to home-care settings as a result of the emergence of telehealth. There will also be greater investment in the health sector in the coming years.</p><h4>What big projects are you working on in the immediate future?</h4><p>Some of the projects we are working on involve developing an oncology and cardiovascular center of excellence and establishing an innovation center.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about the investment strategy DHA recently launched? </h4><p>Our aim is to foster and promote investment in areas that lack services or in medical fields where there are opportunities for growth. Several countries have dedicated healthcare investment promotion agencies, and it is a better and more efficient way to operate. An investment strategy helps prevent oversupply, leads to availability of health specialists across various disciplines, and fosters the growth and development of specialized health services. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does RSG position itself in the Dubai real estate market, and what is its growth strategy?</h4><p>After acquiring some property in Dubai in 1996 and making excellent returns, I wrapped up operations in Kuwait in 2006 and moved to Dubai. The philosophy behind RSG is to go against the market trend: when people sell, as was the case in 2008-2009, we like to buy, and vice versa. With the support of all the team members, RSG continues to win new tenders at a time when the market is silent again, as people have stopped building, even if they are just at the initial phase of their construction project. Step by step, we focus on one project at a time. We are currently building a residential tower in Jumeirah Village Circle and were recently awarded a USD126-million contract for a five-star hotel and hotel apartments project on Sheikh Zayed Road; and a four-star hotel is in the pipeline. The level of service is extremely high in Dubai. For example, in the hospitality industry, a three-star hotel in Dubai is equivalent to a five-star hotel in Europe. This is why RSG Group is more focused on the hospitality sector. On the contracting side, we only work with big local names. The level of integration one gets from locals who are familiar with the culture and way of doing business here cannot be matched by overseas contractors. It is also a matter of reputation; a foreign company can always leave if things go bad, while a local one cannot afford to let clients down.</p><h4>What are the key features of the Dubai market that make it an attractive place to develop and invest in new projects?</h4><p>Due to policies being undertaken by the government, major FDI inflows over the coming years will help the private sector grow even more. We are getting ready for the next boom, though it will not be necessarily tied to Expo 2020. Dubai's leadership will always have something in mind to bring investments, so one should look at the economic cycle with optimism. The strength in this city is unmatched; Dubai cannot fall. The government and the construction industry are not taking a pause, more so because Dubai is a safe place to be compared to neighboring countries. In other places, rules and regulations tend to be old style, slowing down approvals; here, everything is digital, and the infrastructure and the ways the local authorities communicate are extremely efficient and well connected. Overall, it is a professional and business-friendly environment, with a great mix and acceptance of other cultures.</p><p>Given your optimistic sentiment toward the Dubai market, is the Emirate almost risk free?<br>An optimistic sentiment does not mean that there are no risks. There are risks, but they come with leverage: playing with banks' money is hardly a safe choice, and developers should adjust accordingly, without overdoing and overextending themselves. As such, one can reason this to be successful in the Dubai real estate market. Equally important is to have experience and an excellent cash flow. One option is to start as an investor and buy and sell units to build up a healthy fund. Starting as a developer in Dubai is extremely risky. Instead of gaining fast returns, the goal should be to have a well-planned, phased, and balanced growth that does not stretch too far in any one direction. This is why it is advisable to go with government entities; although their ROIs are spread across a longer period of time, they will never crash. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Tightening Up]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[tightening-up]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you expect contractors in the UAE to perform in 2018?</h4><p>The market is fairly positive; there is a great deal of work available, and many projects are coming to the market. However, many contractors are bidding fairly low and competition is fierce. In fact, some contractors are still suffering legacy problems from the crisis in the mid-2000s. Generally, to succeed in this market one needs to be specific; one needs to determine which niche in the market suits the company best and not overextend. There are bottlenecks in the market, however, especially in mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP). A number of MEP companies have suffered dramatic financial loss, and this has undeniably affected our performances. We deal with it by finding niche contractors in the MEP space.</p><h4>Where will demand come from for contractors?</h4><p>The large players are interested in Expo 2020, but residential development continues to drive the demand for construction. For example, Emaar is a big player in the market, and it still has requirements for residential projects. Some contractors specialize in high-rise residential; that is what they do best. It is repetitive and fairly labor intensive; however, they have the expertise and are able to compete in that space. Finally, there are niche markets, with projects such as the Museum of the Future.</p><h4>What economic drivers will affect the local construction sector?</h4><p>The major economic driver is that many people want to live in Dubai; that drives this whole sector at the end of the day. The second one is the price of oil and gas, since these underpin the entire economy, one way or another. The outlook for commodities looks positive in 2018, and we expect a further strengthening of the prices of oil and gas. Furthermore, the region is becoming more stable. Therefore, more people are attracted to Dubai. Moving forward in construction, especially in residential segment, we begin to see a great deal of modularization, where toilet or kitchen parts come completely finished from the factory. These are becoming more common, and it speeds up the ability of contractors to deliver.</p><h4>To what extent do you agree with the argument that contractors are still feeling the pinch, not only of 2008, but of lower oil prices?</h4><p>This is absolutely true in the market. However, the stress that contractors are suffering in the Gulf is not confined to this area; this is also the case in Europe. The buildings that are being delivered are much more complicated than they were even 10 years ago; the requirements for building management systems are becoming more complex, and greater commissioning times are required to get a building fully functioning. Many clients still do not recognize this, and it places more pressure on the contractor to deliver in a shorter time span. We would like to see clients coming into the equation and greater collaboration, and it is not in their interest to squeeze contractors to the extent that the quality or delivery of the building suffers. The prequalification process is definitely tightening up. We would like to see a larger advance payment when we start a project. Moreover, for truly sophisticated plans, we would like to get paid for offsite materials.</p><h4>What is your opinion of Dubai's tendering process?</h4><p>The barriers of entry into the market have to be raised. We see companies that are not technically capable or even financially strong to carry out some of the work. The tendering process has changed dramatically in the last several years; before, it was just a long sum fixed price where the lowest price would win. Today, there are more mid-tender reviews, where the consultant and client will see how the tender is progressing. This has definitely helped us because we have to move away from the concept of awarding a contract to the lowest price. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did 2017 turn out for CSCEC?</h4><p>It has been a busy year for us; the company has expanded for the past three years, and we have signed a number of projects in the GCC and Africa. Ensuring projects delivery is of paramount importance to us, as is ensuring safety, quality, and timely delivery. Despite facing all kinds of different challenges, we feel proud to satisfy our clients in all fields. We have reinforced our market share throughout the region and have received great feedback from clients, boosting our confidence and commitment to provide even better products. </p><h4>What are the typical market characteristics that clients can expect from CSCEC?</h4><p>Clients in Dubai are generally demanding and expect top quality. Years ago, at the beginning of our operations in the Middle East, we had to spend hours to convince our clients we could provide the quality they needed. However, now our track record over the years is the best evidence for clients to feel confident they will get the best quality. Moreover, clients expect projects to be delivered on time; delays are a big risk for clients and banks that fund these projects. We try hard to deliver projects on time, despite challenges from heat and humidity in summer to cultural factors like Ramadan and working hour restrictions. We stick to our schedule and program to deliver on schedule.</p><h4>Has there been a shift in the perception of Chinese companies and their products and services in the market?</h4><p>Chinese companies were considered to deliver cheap and low-quality products. Now, that perception has changed. Good quality products and services from China are now considered to be worth their price. We use a lot of local resources in our company. More than 92% of our workforce is from other nationalities and only 8% is Chinese. We purchase our materials in the local market whenever it qualifies, not because it is a Chinese product. Being the number one contractor has given us huge bargaining power, which comes in handy to get a better rate.</p><h4>How is CSCEC staying ahead in terms of innovation in the construction industry?</h4><p>We at CSCEC have built more than 90% of high-rise buildings in China—buildings higher than 300m—and 50% of these buildings are more than 500m tall. We have the expertise, experience, and the latest technology to build such buildings. As one of the world's leading construction companies, we have spent a lot of resources and funds on R&amp;D. Five years ago, our headquarters set up a separate fund to study high-rise buildings taller than 1,000m. In 2018, we are in the running to build such buildings. Every year we open new projects and improve from year to year, and R&amp;D is critical to be able to do this. China is developing rapidly today in terms of new technology development and applications. For example, we use BIM technology and have spent a lot of money on developing this and other new technologies to stay ahead of the competition. Right now, we are building the longest sea bridge in China, linking Hong Kong, Macau, and the mainland.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the AED8-billion Motor City project with Union Property?</h4><p>We are delighted to have signed the MoU for this project with Union Property, an old partner with whom we have worked for years. It wants us to get involved early enough in the master plan to get the most out of our experience and enable it to create the best design for the project. The master plan of Motor City will take a few years and will have a few phases, so we can also help with financing the project if needed by bringing in Chinese or international banks. Also, the Motor City master plan is such a big project that it requires a company that can take on a broad and complex range of tasks and operations, and CSCEC is well-equiped to be that company. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Where does your long-term assurance come from when talking about Dubai's property market?</h4><p>Dubai is the commercial capital for roughly 40% of the global population living across the Indian subcontinent, Africa, and the Middle East. None of the geographies mentioned have been able to create a city like this, which is vibrant, well-connected, safe, and beautiful. Dubai is the most sustainable real estate city in the Middle East. It delivers high quality living and is not expensive compared to its European and western counterparts. With Dubai running a series of mega projects, the Emirate's property sector is projected to see a ramp-up in 2018, thanks to a growing demand for new apartments ahead of Expo 2020. The three-year supply pipeline in Dubai's property sector is growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5% compared to demand CAGR of 5.6%. As a result, we can see a different investment cycle in the Dubai real estate market. With megaprojects planned, the supply will continue to grow; however, there are new trends that have led to changes in the potential buyers' category. There are first-time buyers flooding the market, and there is a greater supply of units targeted at middle-income buyers. There is a change taking place in the market, and the next two years will identify it until 2020. Importantly, the World Expo 2020 may be two years away, but will surely have an impact on Dubai real estate by creating a higher demand for residential housing in the city. We think this can be attributed to several key factors such as Dubai's status as a top commercial and tourism hub, a rising local population, the maturing nature of the market, strong appeal among international investors, and government funding of major infrastructure projects in time for Expo 2020. For residents and end users with stable income and plans of staying long-term in the Emirate, it is an ideal time to buy, as in some areas, rents can often be higher than mortgage payments.</p><h4>Many say that demand is low. How is that affecting Sobha's business model?</h4><p>The real estate business is cyclical, and no one is able to say how long a cycle is going to last and whether it is a positive or negative one. We expect that if not by 2H2018, the market will be back to normal by 1H2019. According to my analysis, the market is experiencing two-plus-two cycles, meaning two years of positive developments followed by two years of negative ones. Yet even during the two-year negative cycle, there are positive factors and opportunities in the market.</p><h4>The Firdaus Sobha project has been signed off, a huge project in one of the smaller Emirates. How will this project add to Umm Al Quwain?</h4><p>Firdaus Sobha is a joint venture between the government of Umm Al Quwain and Sobha Group on a 5sqkm plot. One of the most beautiful parts of the project is that it is a natural island. Moving forward, it is going to be developed as a city where people can live and experience high-quality entertainment. The project is designed to appeal to all ages in the region. Since the majority of people in this part of the region enjoy being close to the water, the company's aim is for the Firdaus Sobha project to be a dream destination. We broke ground in September 2017, and the project will take a total of 10 years to be completed.</p><p>Do you see other areas of the northern Emirates that have potential for city-within-a-city style development?<br>For the time being, the company is not looking for more projects because we are busy with projects like Meydan Sobha, Sobha Hartland, and Umm Al Quwain. These projects alone create plenty of opportunities in this part of the world. However, we never turn down a good opportunity. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess DAMAC's contribution to Dubai's vision of creating a world-class destination for business and tourism? </h4><p>DAMAC Properties has been at the forefront of the region's real estate market since 2002, developing homes, communities, and delivering investment opportunities for its clients across the globe. By combining our understanding of the region and expertise, we have become known for delivering excellent return on investments. As brand awareness around DAMAC increased globally, and because our initial flagship projects were all developed in Dubai, we became synonymous with the Emirate itself. When our teams showcase projects in China or the UK, they are representing not only DAMAC but also Dubai; we are proud of playing a supportive role in Dubai's rise as a global hub for tourism and business. Alongside our industry partners and public-sector players, such as Dubai Land Department, we continue to push for growth, and we are glad that the real estate sector plays a critical part in the Emirate, and effectively, UAE's economic diversification. </p><h4>What is the underlying philosophy of your real estate initiatives? </h4><p>During DAMAC's founding years, our underlying customer-centric philosophy was to develop and provide unrivalled living experiences in Dubai. Fast-forward to today, our philosophy has not changed, only our scope has expanded. DAMAC now aims to create dream homes and unique living concepts in Dubai and beyond, for its global clients.</p><h4>Could you elaborate on the scope of the AKOYA Oxygen project? </h4><p>AKOYA Oxygen is DAMAC's 55 million sqft master community, located off the Umm Suqeim Road extension and approximately 15 minutes from DAMAC Hills. Since its inception, DAMAC has awarded over USD1.5 billion in construction contracts. AKOYA Oxygen is based on a vision of offering families a serene and secluded community, including state-of-the-art amenities, such as luxury shopping arcades and an 18-hole championship golf course designed by Tiger Woods Design, mosques, clinics, and nurseries. </p><h4>What are the other flagship developments in your pipeline? </h4><p>In Dubai, our customer relationship teams have been guiding our customers through the final stages of home delivery at DAMAC Hills, DAMAC Heights, DAMAC Residenze with interiors by Fendi Casa, and DAMAC Towers by Paramount Hotels &amp; Resorts. In Riyadh, we're delivering DAMAC Exclusiva with Interiors by FENDI and DAMAC Tower by Paramount Residences Riyadh. Also, outside of the UAE, we're in the process of welcoming residents to DAMAC Tower Amman. Beyond that, we recently broke ground of our flagship development in the heart of Dubai, named AYKON City. The project has attracted both local and international investors' interest, owning to its prime location which offers convenience and overlooks the new Dubai Canal. Moreover, last year we announced a joint venture project with the government of Oman to transform Port Sultan Qaboos into an integrated, lifestyle destination that could see USD1 billion in investments. </p><h4>How would you like to further grow DAMAC's international footprint? </h4><p>The DAMAC brand now extends across the Middle East with projects in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Jordan, Lebanon, and Oman. In the UK, we are developing AYKON, London's first fashion-branded residential tower. We continue to explore opportunities in North America, Europe, and the Far East, as we look at how we can bring value to buyers and investors in those markets. With the success of AYKON London One, our focus continues to be on development opportunities in gateway cities around the world.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the upcoming year? </h4><p>There is an encouraging trend of increasing demand for ready inventory in Dubai. Some of this demand can be traced to the growing interest coming from China and India. Also, the run-up to Expo 2020 will be a boost to the local economy. Another encouraging step is the cabinet decision to allow 100% foreign ownership of businesses supported by a 10-year residency for investors, professionals, and students. We expect this to place organic demands on the real estate sector, while encouraging more expat residents to consider the UAE as a long-term home. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the most promising industries to deepen commercial ties between Saudi Arabia and Pakistan?</h4><p>Pakistan and Saudi Arabia enjoy close bonds of friendship and brotherhood based on a shared faith, culture, values, and a commonality of perception on regional and international issues. There is huge potential to expand our economic and trade relations to bring them on par with the excellent political relations that already exist between the two countries. For example, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia have a Joint Ministerial Commission to further enhance their bilateral relations. A productive 11th session of the Pak-Saudi JMC was held in Islamabad in January 2018 and was attended by various ministries and departments from both countries. Cooperation in the mining and minerals, agriculture and livestock, dairy, petrochemical, labor, and tourism sectors can be further enhanced to the mutual benefit of both countries.</p><h4>What economic effects would an FTA with the GCC have on the Pakistani economy, and where do talks stand on the issue?</h4><p>The GCC holds a great importance for Pakistan due to our close fraternal tries, religious and cultural affinity, and the presence of our large community in the region. Pakistan has signed a Framework Agreement (FA) for economic cooperation with GCC countries. Negotiations for an FTA have also been initiated and are still in process. We look forward to an early conclusion of the FTA in a bid to step-up trade between the two sides. It will bring great opportunities of trade and investment to Pakistani businessmen and their GCC counterparts. The former hope that the country will have better opportunities to export rice, meat, and fruit, while GCC countries will have opportunities in the tourism, manufacturing, and services sector of Pakistan. Therefore, an FTA would not only have a positive impact on the Pakistani economy but also on the economies of GCC countries.</p><h4>Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman envisions strengthening the role of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). What role will Pakistan-Saudi Arabia relations play in this process, and what would its economic component be?</h4><p>Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, being important founding members of the OIC who share a common vision for the issues facing the Islamic ummah, have always played a pivotal role in forging unity and cooperation amongst member states. We are fully supportive of the Standing Committee for Economic and Commercial Cooperation of the Organization of the Islamic Cooperation (COMCEC), the main multilateral economic and commercial cooperation platform of the Islamic world. COMCEC addresses the common development problems of the Islamic ummah and provides solutions to them. Together with leading OIC members like Saudi Arabia, Pakistan has been providing support to the causes of the Islamic world in order to enhance intra-OIC socio-economic ties. Pakistan has also signed the Protocol on the Preferential Tariff Scheme for TPS-OIC, along with the Rules of Origin. This protocol promises a developed future of intra-OIC trade exploiting the potentials at all levels. Pakistan is also trying to highlight the importance of RTAs among the OIC member countries, which would enhance intra-OIC trade.</p><h4>What are your hopes and expectations for Saudi Arabian-Pakistani relations in the near future, and what initiatives are pushing those forward today?</h4><p>Pakistanis have a special place and reverence in their hearts for the Saudi leadership, the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, His Majesty King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, and His Highness Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense. The relationship is also based on deep mutual trust and common aspirations of the people of the two countries, which is evident from a similarity of views on many regional and international issues. The two countries also support each other at various international organizations, including the UN and the OIC. Our relations are all encompassing, including strong security ties and robust economic relations. Both countries have much to gain from this relationship, as Saudi Arabia embarks on the implementation of Vision 2030. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the integration of DDW and DP World gone thus far, and how does DDW strengthen DP World's maritime services business?</h4><p>We integrated DDW, P&amp;O Maritime, P&amp;O Ports, P&amp;O Marinas, and Dubai Maritime City into one group, the Maritime Services Division (MSD) of DP World. Consolidating these companies improved efficiency and effectiveness through beneficial synergies across the group in enhanced specialized services, refined business strategies that maximize the skills of each entity, and streamlined processes to achieve significant improvements. Being associated with the DP World Group provides massive potential. In Dubai, we have the largest single-company operated port, and there are 25,000 different vessels coming through the port. Together, MSD has around 320 vessels of all kinds. These vessels require maintenance and rebuilds that can benefit from services within the group. At DDW, the yard benefits from an excellent location in the center of Dubai—a city that aims to be the cleanest in the world, and we would like to follow this excellent environmental objective. We want to bring added value through the testing services available in our marine section and restructure DDW to utilize solar for our energy needs. DDW is skilled in producing specialized vessels, including high-quality tugs, and we have a number of projects globally that are focused on creating innovative vessels. The yard can do many other specialized work, such as construction of crane frames, since we have the most sophisticated and diversified engineering welding team. We were recently approached by the UK's Atomic Energy Authority to produce special cylinders for a nuclear station, and we are also working with international banks and oil firms to clean the unused and derelict rigs polluting the North Sea. DDW is an open-minded company that is always looking for ways to grow and expand; under the MSD group, the yard can draw on synergies to strengthen performance.</p><h4>What new businesses do you plan to capture?</h4><p>We are negotiating with clients from various sectors, including the navy and passenger vessel owners, to create tailored innovative solutions to meet their specific needs. We also hope to capture more business overhauling the large LNG vessels. At the moment, our YoY market share has increased by 23%. The yard is currently working at 100% capacity, and improvements are being made to this capacity by sharpening our focus to ensure all business processes are more efficient. New specialists are being hired, and additional capital expenditures are being evaluated to integrate robotic technology in the yard. Our diverse services and facilities are capable of handling any type of vessel, are situated near to the largest port and economic free zone, as well as in close proximity to the Dubai city center and marinas.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>DDW is fortunate to have a visionary chairman; we are now properly restructuring the company and aligning ourselves with projects of every type and size. DDW has over 240 clients, which is significant but not satisfactory. We are looking to create value-added services that will attract new clients. We have worked to outfit and repair some of the most high-profile and expensive yachts in the world. This is a niche market that requires highly skilled workers and is an area in which I foresee growth. The yard is positioned to offer excellent services to many areas of our operations, including yachts, navy vessels, and advanced specialized ships. Innovation and technology play a central theme in our outlook and strategy going forward. 2018 is full of opportunities and growth for DDW, as well as the MSD group; by thinking ahead, innovating, and adapting to change, we will generate significant growth in our global services. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main trends shaping the maritime industry? </h4><p>Constant adoption of necessary technology and infrastructure capable of handling advancements is imperative to ensure competitiveness. Futuristic solutions, smart applications, and maritime licensing procedures are our key focus areas, with innovation and smart transformation at the core of our efforts. The sector plays a crucial role in Dubai's transformation into a leading global economic hub, in line with the Dubai Plan 2021. DMCA has recently adopted the "Dubai Maritime Innovation Quattro Helix Partnerships" model, which is intended to strengthen the collaboration between the government, academicians, private sector, and research and development institutions. Implementation of smart applications and e-licensing mechanisms remain our key focus areas to further build on our vision to make innovation and smart transformation the cornerstones for exploring and redefining the future of the maritime sector. We have launched a wide range of applications and services by DMCA to facilitate online inquiries and payments including application status; crew license validity; craft license validity; penalty search; application for penalty objection; penalty payment; and service payment. Dubai has been immensely successful in capitalizing on its strong reputation in the maritime sector to attract major international shipping companies. According to a Menon Group survey, the Emirate was rated 10th among the top-15 maritime cities worldwide by industry leaders. </p><h4>How do you assess the success of the Dubai Maritime Sector Strategy (DMSS)? </h4><p>DMSS is a major stride toward achieving a fundamental change across the local maritime industry to ultimately position Dubai as a foremost international maritime hub. The strategy was launched to drive investment opportunities in Dubai. World-class infrastructure and business-friendly regulations are key focus areas of the strategy. We continuously invest in more advanced infrastructure, the development of policies and integrated regulatory frameworks, and further enhancement of our maritime capabilities, all of which will secure Dubai's leading position on the global maritime map. According to a report released by Menon Group for Business Economics, the Emirate ranked fifth in the most competitive and attractive maritime clusters in the world. Through the successful implementation of the strategy, we aim to increase the sector's contributions to economy, which accounted for AED26.9 billion, or 7%, of total GDP in 2017. The latest numbers are indicative of the growth of maritime sector's contributions, which grew at an unprecedented rate of 25%. </p><h4>How does Innovation Quay enhance innovation and the use of advanced technologies in Dubai's maritime sector?</h4><p>Innovation Quay is an ambitious venture designed to take advantage of technological innovations in support of the efforts to drive development across all aspects of the maritime sector, thereby accelerating the country's economic diversification. It complements the successes of DMCA's "Maritime Creativity and Innovation Lab" in nurturing a culture of creativity and expanding the maritime clustering in line with the needs of the 21st century. Innovation Quay encourages leading manufacturers and research institutions to carry out field studies to create new experiences using the latest innovative technologies such as drones, 3D technology, and smart and self-driving ships. </p><h4>To what extent has Dubai Maritime Virtual Cluster (DMVC) harnessed cooperation and engagement? </h4><p>The establishment of DMVC is in line with our efforts to add to the competitiveness and attractiveness of the local maritime sector. It builds on four main pillars of developing maritime clusters, empowering the sector, spreading awareness, and encouraging participation. The initiative has immense potential to enhance the sector's competitiveness, inclusiveness, and excellence. In addition, it seeks to boost investor confidence in Dubai at the regional and global levels, as well as strengthen the maritime sector's role as a vital economic contributor to the Emirate's economic diversification as it prepares for a post-oil era. By enabling investors and stakeholders to gain reliable information on services, initiatives and competitive advantages offered by Dubai, DMVC's informative and interactive platform supports the national efforts aimed at making Dubai the world's smartest and happiest city by 2021. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What do you identify to be the key drivers that will boost maritime trade in Dubai in the coming years?</h4><p>Economic diversification in line with the Dubai Plan 2021 and preparation for Expo 2020 will be major drivers. Dubai's 2018 general budget unveiled an AED56.6-billion yearly budget with a focus on infrastructure projects led by Expo 2020 and social development programs to create more than 3,100 jobs. The budget also features a rise in infrastructure spending, which makes up 21% of total government expenditure. Construction material, electronics, new tech, and goods for the growth of industry sectors will come through our flagship Jebel Ali Port. Maritime trade will continue to be fueled by such growth plans in the coming years. </p><h4>What new and innovative technology is being adopted in Dubai's ports to ease trade flows?</h4><p>Technologies such as drones for maintenance and security, blockchain, artificial intelligence (AI), big data, robotics, and driverless vehicles will all contribute to making supply chains faster and more productive. Dubai Trade's one-stop electronic trade portal is another example that offers integrated electronic services from trade and logistics service providers in Dubai under a single window, including the online services of DP World and Dubai Customs.<br></p><h4>To what extent to do you agree with the argument that due to the uncertainty in the global market conditions, volumes are decreasing and demand is shifting away from Dubai?</h4><p>Drewry has in fact upgraded its demand forecast for 2018 to 4.3%, while the creation of bigger alliances and increase in M&amp;A activity have boosted the bottom line for most lines. Improvements in the way we manage our capacities owing to tech innovation has maximized our trade potential. Our flagship Jebel Ali Port has been performing better each year, so we have not witnessed a shift away from Dubai—if anything, we have seen it improve. Globally, we handled 70.1 million TEUs across our global portfolio of container terminals in 2017, with gross container volumes growing by 10.1% YoY, above Drewry Maritime's global container throughput growth estimate of 6.0% for 2017. Overall, the UAE handled 15.4 million TEUs in 2017, a YoY increase of 4%.  </p><h4>How is cruise tourism incentivized in Dubai, and what is DP World's role in its development?</h4><p>Dubai has a vision to attract 20 million tourists a year by 2020, and the Department of Tourism &amp; Commerce Marketing (DTCM) anticipates cruise tourist numbers to reach 1 million by that time.  Aligned with this vision, we inaugurated the Hamdan bin Mohammed Cruise Terminal in January 2017, an ultra-modern third cruise terminal in Dubai, which is the world's largest single, covered cruise facility. The new building increased the handling capacity from 2 million tourists to 7 million. Mina Rashid can now serve up to seven cruise vessels at one time and more than 25,000 passengers in its three cruise terminals. It has also made Dubai a base for cruise tours visiting other ports in the UAE and the Gulf, and beyond. In November 2017, we also inaugurated the Marinas at the Mina Rashid Marina, a new world-class maritime and entertainment attraction that will accommodate 20,000 yachts and boats in the next few years. Carried out by P&amp;O, DP World's maritime solutions arm, the Marina stretches across 13sqkm and features a number of facilities including an integrated entertainment city, Marina Cube. Dubai welcomed more than 625,000 cruise tourists via a total of 157 ship calls during the last cruise season compared to 133 ship calls in the 2015-2016 season, reflecting a 15% increase.</p><h4>What are DP World's expansion plans for 2018?</h4><p>As a global trade enabler, we will grow complementary sectors in the global supply chain such as industrial parks, free zones, and logistics. Successfully setting up these new streams across our portfolio and in new locations around the world will be a major focus. We will continue to assess new opportunities. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-hub-in-the-making]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>2017 was an important year for AES. How do you evaluate the company's progress?</h4><p>The operations were positive in Panama. We had USD73 million in dividends, of which USD35.3 million was given to the Panamanian state. On the other hand, in 2016 we started with the construction of the first gas-fired power plant of Panama and Central America. We plan to inaugurate it in August 2018 so that it enters into full operation on September 1, 2018.<br>Can you elaborate on AES' experience in the Dominican Republic?<br>In the Dominican Republic, we have AES Andres, which is a plant similar to the one we are building here, close to the international airport. That plant has a 160,000-cbm tank. To date, we have had over 100 natural gas discharges without any incident. We have an open terminal where ships and trucks can enter and exit for deliveries to any point in the Caribbean. A decade on, AES has positioned itself well in the Dominican Republic. </p><h4>Over 50 companies from different countries have already expressed interested in receiving natural gas from Panama. What is your strategy to attract them?</h4><p>These are cruise companies, industries, hotels, tourism, and power companies that use bunker or diesel and would like to convert to LNG, which is cleaner and more efficient. Cement companies that use LNG in their production process and vehicles are also interested. In the last few years, we focused on assembling the plant, though few people believed we would be able to do it on time. There have been many challenges in this project, such as the transmission line, but we must deliver by September 1. In 2017, AES agreed to enter into a joint venture with Engie Total, our gas supplier, to market and sell LNG to third parties in Central America. Since mid-2017, we have worked with business leaders and public authorities in Honduras, for example, to encourage them to build something on a smaller scale using LNG from Panama, benefitting both countries. </p><h4>How do you foresee Panama becoming an energy hub in the region?</h4><p>I foresee Panama becoming a hub of natural gas by distributing it to Central America and parts of the Caribbean. Our plant uses 25% of our 180,000cbm tank, and the rest can be marketed mainly to four segments. The first is power generation, and the second is bunkering LNG tankers that pass through the Canal. There are significant restrictions on environmental matters that will urge future ships to use natural gas as fuel. Third is the industrial segment, namely the refrigeration industry, food, paints, glass, vehicles, ketones, and in general any type of industry that uses boilers. These industries are migrating to natural gas because it is more efficient, cheaper, and the machinery is more durable due to the use of a cleaner fuel. Fourth is transportation; in Madrid and much of northern Europe, the US, as well as Cartagena and Medellí­n, natural gas is used for transportation. These segments may receive LNG through different systems such as trains, pipes, trucks, ships, and ISO containers. Through its LNG project, AES has opened an interesting opportunity for Panama to position itself as an LNG distribution hub and for other companies to take advantage of our LNG storage tank and terminal. </p><h4>How else has AES contributed to the socio-economic development of the region?</h4><p>Our project has directly injected USD1.15 billion into the economy. Regarding employment, about 87% of the 2,500 people that worked during the project's construction peak were Panamanians, 69% of which were from Colón. Seeking to benefit local communities as much as possible, when we had a shortage of specialized welders for the LNG storage tank, we decided to make an agreement with the Colón regional branch of the Universidad Tecnológica de Panamá to train a  number of young people in mechanics, electro-mechanics, electronics, and welding. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How was 2017 for ABB's operations in Panama?</h4><p><span></span><strong>BLAS GONZALEZ R</strong> We are responsible for the entire Central American and Caribbean region for ABB. As Country Manager for the entire region, I have an overview of all the areas. In Panama's case, the country is experiencing a slowdown, which is not what we were expecting. There are new players here, such as Chinese companies. ABB has more competitors, which makes business tougher. Nevertheless, we still expect a return on next year. </p><p><strong>NICANOR RIVERA</strong> The window is open right now with major projects underway, such as the fourth transmission line, which also includes two big substations and 500 KB. This is USD500 million worth of power equipment and is a great new opportunity for us that we did not expect to get even two years ago.</p><h4>Will ABB bid for this kind of project?</h4><p><span></span><strong>BGR</strong> No, in these countries we are equipment suppliers. We have to wait for an engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) company to bid, and then we come in behind it and give a quote for our equipment. We try to provide quotes to as many EPCs as possible that are participating in such bids. The problem is that, for example, a Chinese company will always buy its equipment from China. Locally, we do not have many opportunities with Chinese companies, just for after-sales service. However, the real business for us is selling equipment. </p><h4>In 2017, ABB expressed its intention to expand in solar energy. How is this progressing?</h4><p><span></span><strong>BGR</strong> Cirsa is one of our customers and has several projects in Honduras and Panama. We are currently waiting for a decision about these projects, which are somewhere in the region of 50MW. One of ABB's main interests is renewables—solar, wind, and geothermal. However, today solar power still only makes up 2% of Panama's power generation. There are many hydropower generation plants in the country, which prevented many from thinking about solar in the past. Now, the country has started to consider it, though the existing legal framework is not clear. For example, there is a law that prioritizes the generation capacity of existing plants, so big companies are not interested in new projects. Second, there is a great deal of debate about the new solar tax the government wants to introduce. In a small market such as Panama, tariffs will discourage people. We are still a suitable country for renewables, but the government has to clarify its laws to encourage renewable projects here.</p><h4>In 2017 there were more than 25 competitors in the market. What competitive advantages does ABB have in Panama?</h4><p>BGR Our name and brand are an advantage. One of our strengths that few other companies have is that ABB invests a large amount in R&amp;D. This means our equipment is truly at the cutting edge of technology. We also offer many devices that relate to IoT and digital technology, and have over 100 ABB products for our customers in the fields of IoT and digital communications and solutions. Added to this, we are locals.</p><h4>What are your main objectives and priorities at ABB for the year ahead?</h4><p><span></span><strong>NR </strong>In the next year, we hope to be involved in the new transmission line and substation project. These substations will be huge, so it is important for us to try to be involved. ABB previously worked closely on a major part of the Panama Canal expansion project, an important project for us on which we were involved for eight months. </p><p><span></span><strong>BGR</strong> We are also developing more capabilities and services because we want to grow in this segment, especially in transformers and digital solutions. For this, we will hire more people, mostly in Panama but also elsewhere in the region. We are keen to expand our capabilities in terms of projects. We are mainly equipment suppliers, though we are developing a couple of units locally to approach small power solution projects in the USD1.5-3 million range. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you evaluate 2017?</h4><p><span></span>I am extremely satisfied with the progress of our plans and the important role we have played in defining the country's energy policy. Several years ago, we issued the National Energy Plan 2015-2050. We reviewed that plan in 2017 and held meetings with civil society groups and the broad participation of the entire country to review and update it. The development plans are guides; they are not fixed. The most important result is the emphasis on energy efficiency, and to that effect the secretariat has made significant efforts and has had much success in creating standards of efficiency and a technical regulation for equipment entering the country. Not only were technical regulations published last year; minimum indexes of consumption will come into force during a trial period. This allows providers to adapt to these new conditions.</p><h4>What are the highlights of the 2015-2050 plan?</h4><p>The main highlight is the approach of energy efficiency. We talk about coverage and the participation of renewable energy, though one of the things we had to control was demand. We want demand to grow in a more reasonable way and are making progress there. We have also advanced in construction regulations. A plan was drafted; now we are working on the implementation. It will come into force in the short term, likely in 2018. This will reduce energy consumption on the baseline in new constructions by 15%, which will result in a better use of energy. We have managed to create opportunities for the private sector in investments. This is going well, though the state must intervene in efficiency, for example. The regulation for energy transportation was drafted with the help of engineers and the Green Building Council. On the other hand, energy coverage is going fairly well. When we started, we had tenders to overcome the deficit in previous years, which is no longer the case. We also held some tenders for long-term investments. As a result, there are several projects based on natural gas.</p><h4>What can you share with us about the ETESA project?</h4><p>The ETESA project is finished, and the network is more optimal. There are still some limitations of the system of transport. Because of our geography, most hydroelectric generation projects are in the west of the country and far away. We have other projects in addition to the third line, such as the fourth line. It will be a higher voltage line compared to the previous ones. It is a 500kW line and will have a larger capacity than previous ones. The system will be more robust and allow for easier maintenance. The electrical systems tend to be delicate; when there is a shortage, the system collapses. The third line was built between 2014 and 2017, and we are fairly pleased with the advances in energy efficiency. We will also start a hiring process that will give more participation to renewable energies. In the long run, the entry of natural gas into the system will result in greater flexibility and reliability in operations. In renewables there is an intermittency problem. International interconnections are also extremely important, like the one with Central America, which people have been working on for a few years, though the market has yet to be perfected. We are working to implement an interconnection project with Colombia that would also allow a connection to the rest of South America.</p><h4>What is the strategy of the secretariat when cooperating with other ministries?</h4><p>We work closely with the Ministry of Economy and Finance and the Ministry of Commerce. We also have a relationship with the Ministry of Environment in our current projects, because many of the energy efficiency programs and development for renewables are part of its objectives. Finally, we work a lot on social programs with the government. There is a great level of interaction and collaboration within the government. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[A Common Value Proposition]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[a-common-value-proposition]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the financial performance of the terminal in 2017, and what are your expectations for 2018?</h4><p>In terms of volume, we did about 3% more containers in 2017 than 2016, and the forecast for this year is to be 5% over 2017 volumes. We face an interesting and challenging maritime sector and container market, as there are many mergers and acquisitions. Of the top 20 container lines from three years ago, only nine remain; more than half have disappeared through mergers, acquisitions, or bankruptcy. Shipping lines, therefore, have more bargaining power, and we also face more competition, which is great for Latin America's economies and consumers, though not so much for the port sector's incumbents. We have seen a great deal of FDI directed to ports, especially in Costa Rica and Colombia. However, Panama has been on an upward trajectory of developing the port sector for almost 25 years now, and it should, therefore, come as no surprise that more countries are taking a look at what Panama did and trying to replicate the model. Latin America in general is rebounding after a few years of economic slowdown. We have been in talks with the Canal and other ports to determine how we can streamline the value proposition for Panama. We would like all the ports and the Canal to present a common value proposition to shipping lines.</p><h4>How do you foresee Panama becoming a major center of distribution of e-commerce similar to Miami?</h4><p>The first thing we have to do is provide certainty to the user of the system, whether that is e-commerce, distribution centers, or multinational companies. The system must behave the same way every day, as consistency is key. Many hate having one set of rules one day and another the next day; therefore, we have to ensure the procedures are in place and applied consistently. The second thing is that once all that is in place, we need to have a united value proposition. We are only thinking about the Canal and ports; however, we should not stop there and should go out as Panama. I disagree with the opinion that Panama's best asset is its geographical position; the world is round, and if we were to put a pin in any part of the world it would be the center of the world. We have the Canal, and we invested in ports and warehouses, so we have assets. We have invested a way to make us more competitive and take advantage. If the Canal had been built in Nicaragua, there would not have been a geographical position, as it was about investment and infrastructure. We have to make sure this infrastructure works together. We cannot have one container take two or three days to go from a port to a warehouse because of certain processes; we have to make these assets work together as one and make it work in three ways. We have to unify the infrastructure, processes, and commercial approach in order to continue doing this. Panama is already a major player and there is know-how. We need to make sure all the parts play even better together.</p><h4>What are your goals and priorities for the year ahead?</h4><p>We are extremely hopeful about the future. We had the opportunity to travel extensively and realized that Panamanians like to punish themselves, and many times see only the bad things happening in the country. We have had many chances to realize that people from the outside are talking about the many opportunities there are in Panama to be successful. We have been working on Panahub 2.0 and are working on initiatives to streamline the value proposition and make it more competitive. We are extremely hopeful about the future for 2019 and the coming years, as we are on the right track and just have to continue applying ourselves to look ahead. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has your portfolio of services evolved, how does consumer demand and trends affect your overall group strategy?</h4>The global logistics industry is fast-paced with ever changing dynamics. We believe that a customer centric approach is key to being successful within this industry. We consider it crucial to remain flexible, while also having a portfolio of services that reflect the needs of the market. Therefore, our current operational approach combines a number of key elements, including a full spectrum of domestic cargo, parcel services, storage facilities and regional transportation. Additionally, our tracking system with real-time communication provides a more convenient logistics experience. In a competitive market we strive to provide customers with value for money while also leveraging promotions. Building and maintaining relationships with clients while offering tailored solutions will ensure that we continue to grow.<h4>How and where do you expect automation to impact the logistics sector and what will be the major challenges of new technology?</h4><p>The evolution of technology is pushing boundaries and changing how we do business. From a logistics perspective, being able to do business online allows for greater control over certain variables. The fact that it is now possible to receive a package in less than an hour demonstrates the positive role that technology has had in our industry. However, technology has increased competition to maintain a leading business position within the market we readily implement the latest technological processes into our operation. Improved technology has also increased productivity in the supply chain and minimized the costs and errors. These advances benefit important areas of the logistics industry, such as international transportation, fleet management, enhancing GPS accuracy and even social media.</p><h4>How would you assess the regulatory environment that establishes customs and control of the transit of goods in the UAE and what else should the authorities do to enhance the role of the private sector?</h4><p>The UAE has made compelling efforts to build the logistic industry, this is evident with investment that has taken place to build world class infrastructure. Additionally, there has been great effort to ensure transparency and equality within the industry, this has provided opportunities for logistics providers and ensured equilibrium in the market. Authorities are receptive to implementing innovative solutions and by continuing to build knowledge on best practices. We believe that the private sector stands to benefit immeasurably from newer and more simplified regulations.</p><h4>What is the key for the UAE to maintain its competitiveness, given that the Asia Pacific is expected to remain the strongest region?</h4><p>Dubai is well-established as the Middle East's prime destination for the regional headquarters of multinational corporations. Its global reputation as a wealth generator and investment stronghold continues to drive the city's growth. Continued diversification and building the knowledge-based and services driven economy will be key to maintaining this position. Additionally, maintaining a business environment that values innovation will ensure that the UAE remains a gateway for business in the region. A continued recognition and drive by the government to grow strategic industries, develop technology, pioneer new innovation and foster thought leadership will be vital. World class leaders in trade, logistics, financial services, hospitality and tourism, real estate, construction and manufacturing will add further value to the economy through expertise. This diversification, along with its strategic location, world class infrastructure and ease of business philosophy continue to make Dubai globally relevant. Moreover, Dubai has strategically added up to 20 free zones while also having the most developed financial services in the region. Significant advances have been made in the protection of Intellectual Property Rights with more robust copyright, trademark and patent laws.</p><h4>The shipping industry has come under increased pressure to curb emissions, how will this impact the logistics industry?</h4><p>We all have a responsibility to limit our negative impact on the environment, at Extreme Express we are fully supportive any regulation, action or initiative that minimizes this negative impact. New technology has allowed for increased efficiencies across our operation and this has helped drastically reduce our environmental footprint. Interestingly, increased pressure to curb emissions has increased competition within the logistics industry, as most companies are applying new methods and technologies. It is an additional challenge for logistics service providers to continuously improve, therefore we welcome further technological advances.</p><h4>What are the prospects of cross-border e-commerce in the UAE and GCC region and what will be the implications of a stronger presence of giants like Amazon and Alibaba?</h4><p>A significant percentage of UAE online shoppers buy from other countries, we foresee that there will be future demand for the cross-border e-commerce in UAE and therefore this will lead to opportunities for logistics providers. Having the highest download speed in the region coupled with favorable costs and the ease of shipping gives the UAE an additional advantage in e-commerce. E-commerce is a thriving industry, it is complemented by a wider digital transformation trend. Our daily activities are shaped by our online experiences, new platforms have changed the way we relate to business, this has increased competition and created challenges for traditional business.  The giants of e-commerce will benefit from the increased online demand, at the same time, there will be challenges for newly established local platforms. We foresee an increase in competition due to these companies having extensive industry expertise and the latest technology.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How are customers' expectations shaping the further development of the local e-commerce market?</h4><p>DHL's longstanding B2B customers are our main network, and our business is built on them. E-commerce is a massive phenomenon and has grown quickly. Logistics companies such as DHL play an important role in how quickly local businesses grow. We can open the world to local companies by giving them access to the 220 countries in our global network. Inbound shipping is popular these days, and the customers purchasing habits have gone mobile. Simultaneously, we recognized that our couriers and customer service employees are the face of the company and instrumental in how we are perceived, particularly in the B2B segment. The most important customer interaction with online shopping is often the final mile and delivery. Therefore, we invest heavily in our people and place great value on our employees. We want to ensure that customers have the best experience possible from start to finish. Around 12-15% of the global retail market is based on e-commerce, while in the Middle East it is only 2-3%, illustrating how much room there is for growth. The three largest markets are Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Kuwait, and we focus on expanding our presence in these three markets. From a logistics point of view, the biggest inbound lanes are the US, Asia, and Europe. Intra-Middle East is still a modest market, though it will continue to grow. International firms have acquired large local companies, and the local entrepreneurial spirit is highly dynamic. We have customers who started small but now ship outbound to Europe and the US. </p><h4>How is the Internet of Things (IoT) contributing to the e-commerce and logistics industry?</h4><p>IoT will create extraordinary connectivity, which will lead to greater efficiency across the industry. Currently, there are nearly 15 billion connections, and by 2030, this will grow to 50 billion. Such connectivity maximizes many different aspects of our business, from low-cost sensors to efficient modeling and delivery. Today, we have B2C shipping, allowing us to create more complex and efficient variations of classic logistics movements. Connectivity will change the way we do business, and this is the power of the IoT. DHL has an innovation center in Bonn, Germany, which is experimenting with driverless vehicles, drones, and other technologies. We have designed and built electric vehicles and are now providing these technologies to even our rivals. As a global company, we are truly on the cutting edge of innovation and connectivity solutions. Drone technologies are a little more complex; we have used drones to deliver medication, but we will not have drones buzzing around Dubai in the foreseeable future.</p><h4>How will your investment in the Cargo Terminal at DXB bolster your position in MENA?</h4><p>We are in a constant process of building a jigsaw of solutions, and Dubai is a key part of that puzzle. We can now process more than 5,000 shipments per hour through that one facility. We have great security, allowing us to safely manage everything that moves through the facility, and we work closely with  police and customs to ensure smooth transactions and no delays. In addition to the DXB investments, we have invested considerable amounts across the Middle East. We want to ensure that the UAE has great connectivity to the rest of the world so our customers can have the best possible solutions. This maximizes our local, regional, and global networks.</p><h4>What is the impetus behind DHL's shift to more environmentally conscious delivery services?</h4><p>Environmentally conscious delivery services are part of our mission to improve the world. The larger the company, the larger its responsibility not only to its customers and employees, but to the global citizenry. We are committed to having zero emissions by 2050. DHL's Got Heart is focused on recognizing and supporting individuals in our organization who use their own free time to give back to the community. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main accomplishments of RTA over the last year?</h4><p>RTA is leading the transformation of the transport sector into the future. The ongoing expansion of roads and infrastructure projects in Dubai include landmark developments such as the Airport Roads Project, which caters to around 92 million travelers expected to be served by Dubai International Airport by 2020; the Parallel Roads Project that will ease traffic in the area parallel to Sheikh Zayed Road to the east; and the construction of Route 2020 worth AED10.6 billion which is a 15-km extension of the existing Red Line route. In addition, RTA has set strategies to shape the future of transport with the Dubai Self-Driving Strategy, which aims to achieve at least 25% of all trips in Dubai through self-driving transport by 2030. The Dubai Self-Driving Strategy is the most comprehensive of its kind in the world, as it does not only focus on private vehicles, but also targets seven public transport modes. RTA is currently studying and piloting several futuristic modes with global firms, such as the hyperloop, self-driving bus rapid transit (BRT), self-driving transport pods, and automated aerial taxis. Another important accomplishment is the Enterprise Command and Control Centre (EC3), which was inaugurated by Sheikh Mohammed in May 2017. It is the largest and most sophisticated facility of its kind. Known as the "Nerve Center of Dubai," it links all of RTA's different transport control centers into an integrated central platform, which will also play an important role in managing transport for the upcoming Expo 2020. RTA has recently also approved the RTA Digital Strategy, focusing on innovative technology solutions tailored for users. We already started the smart mobility transformation and have implemented a number of future modes that have made transportation in Dubai smarter and cleaner. We have the largest public Tesla fleet in the world, consisting of 200 electric airport limos. Moreover, we have implemented a number of smart solutions, such as smart car rentals, smart bus shelters, smart yard testing, and virtual reality training for new drivers. We currently have over 173 smart services that have reduced the number of customer visits by more than 50% in the past two years.</p><h4>What benefits can self-driving vehicles bring to Dubai? </h4><p>RTA is working on many projects to achieve the goal of having at least 25% of all trips in Dubai in self-driving mode by 2030. Examples of these are the connectivity framework, testing procedures, and the legislative framework. We have already signed MoUs and partnerships with multiple international firms and research universities, such as Daimler, Next Future Transport, Hyperloop, and Tesla. Through our strategy, we will realize both measurable and intangible benefits in Dubai by 2030. Based on our international research and its application to our local environment, we expect to achieve a 12% reduction in our carbon footprint. Moreover, we expect a 44% reduction in the cost of mobility, a 50% reduction in parking requirements, and at least a 12% reduction in the number of accidents.</p><h4>What are RTA's main plans and objectives for the coming year?</h4><p>In the next few years, RTA will continue its journey to lead the mobility sector and transform Dubai into the smartest city in the world. We will foster our cooperation with innovators and start-ups to continue testing, piloting, and deploying new trends, technologies, and modes. In this regard, we also work with Dubai Future Accelerators to launch partnership platforms that will make Dubai the global attraction of future transport modes. Another example is our recently launched Dubai Challenge for Self-Driving Transport, the largest international platform for companies and research centers to test and deploy different scenarios of self-driving technology. We also concentrate on safety, security, and privacy issues of such new modes. We will continue our efforts to optimize the efficiency of our mobility systems through initiating and launching different applications and further developing and expanding Dubai's transport systems. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us more about your successes in the past year?</h4><p>Over the last few years in the media sector as we develop and mature our focus has been on the creation of value. Attracting new businesses into the zones is happening organically and at a pace that we are comfortable and pleased with. We need companies to not just come in but continue to create value. We are pleased with the outcome of these processes and have upgraded a great deal of both physical and virtual infrastructure. We also see a great deal of communication taking place with our business partners in our different locations. Today, we run Dubai Media City, Dubai Production City, and Dubai Studio City. Each entity is focused on a certain aspect of the media sector that we serve and comes with a unique customer outlook.</p><h4>What synergies are generated between the three free zones?</h4><p>The industry has evolved rapidly. Previously, it was much more segregated, though now it is in fact the opposite. There is digital production and content creation that builds on these platforms and this creates the platform for more people to work with each other. Since publishing is somehow slowing down, digital companies can utilize this industry in a different way. Such collaborations across all brands are critical to our sustainability in the long run. Our business model is built on the success of businesses, and it is only possible when there are many synergies taking place across all these brands in our zones.</p><h4>What is your strategy for new media?</h4><p>There are more things happening on the ground at a much quicker pace. We partnered with YouTube to launch the first YouTube Space in the Region, which will result in lending more support for this sector of the market. We created in5 Media, a support mechanism for content creators to be able to produce whether an actor, light expert, or a makeup artist. We want to bring all of them under one roof and want to train more people in these sectors, which is a critical factor for the industry to grow strategically. The industry requires skilled light technicians, sound technicians, editors, and more. It is a wide spectrum and we want to serve the entire spectrum by providing on-ground support. We have film makeup workshop for example, which many people are interested in. Today many do not want to spend large sums of money on film equipment so we support them; we ask them to execute their idea on our platform, and we provide the equipment, support, and workshops so that they can upgrade their skills. We are creating a vibrant community that will benefit others far into the future.</p><h4>How do you attract large productions to Dubai?</h4><p>Like any place around the world, it starts with being known for something. Today, Dubai has a stellar reputation in the international market for many different aspects. This results in more things taking place on the ground. At a certain point in time people want to explore new and exciting places. The UAE in general is an exciting and new place. Dubai is only 40 years old and most of it was built in the past 25 years. We have time to develop into an even better city. HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum wants people to deliver quality but also quickly. It is great to have a progressive government that is always looking at how we can evolve and develop. There are many reasons why people would want to come and film here; the question is how we make it attractive for them to come and for that we do tailor-made approaches, designed to address their needs. There are many movies filmed in Dubai City and it is a great benefit to all. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You have argued that telecoms have to go beyond connectivity services to remain successful. How are you developing du in this sense?</h4><p>All telecoms companies will be completely different in 2022 from what they are today. The disruption in the telecommunications industry will continue and even accelerate. The Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, big data, and other disruptive technologies will increasingly have an overbearing influence on many of the things that we do. The impact of this disruption will be immense, which is why we needed to better prepare and evolve our company beyond our mainstay—the connectivity business. We crossed the AED13-billion (USD3.5-billion) mark in revenue for the first time in 2017, of which more than 95% comes purely from the connectivity business. We need to ensure the development on that is all about efficiency, customer experience, and digitalization. We are one of the two major players in the UAE that enable connectivity. Two years ago, we debated this idea that we can do more for businesses, for example around data. We can host data for companies, manage data for them, put a security layer around it, or create applications for companies that can be used in this space. We are starting to provide illustrations of this in government departments. Within that framework, we are not limiting ourselves to providing connectivity. As cities, nations, and governments move to become smarter and more digital, we will see greater need for such new partnerships.</p><h4>What challenges and opportunities will these disruptive developments bring about for du and society as a whole?</h4><p>Our non-connectivity business grew by more than 85% in 2017, and this is our fastest growth track, even though over 95% of our business comes from the connectivity business. With non-connectivity as the primary growth driver, our main focus on the connectivity side of business is to extract higher efficiency and better margins. One should expect an acceleration of disruptive developments. Conversations around the balance between the technologically possible, economically viable, societally beneficial, humanly rewarding, and ethically compatible are needed. The recent World Government Summit in Dubai was one of the most developed platforms for these conversations at the level of government, industry, and academia, and these conversations need to happen. In the UAE, we have a Minister of Artificial Intelligence, which is great to ensure we make full use of the opportunities of technology. We also have a Minister of Happiness, Minister of Tolerance, and Minister of Youth, reminding us we need an integrated conversation about all this. Another important disruptive development is the move to a decentralized ecosystem. New opportunities and these technologies can serve the noble ambition of serving people's happiness. </p><h4>du develops the Smart Dubai Platform that serves as a central operating system of the city. What features make the Smart Dubai Platform one of a kind?</h4><p>Other smart cities in the world are smart in one or just a few dimensions. They need to solve or enhance a current situation and move into a certain theme. In Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum has set the target for Dubai to be at the forefront of the transformation of cities and nations and to be the smartest and happiest city in the world. In the Dubai Smart City ambition, six dimensions will be addressed. The ambition is incomparable to any other smart city development in the world as the scope is broader, and having this broader scope means the data connected from these sensors, IoT, and multiple government departments that interact will be richer than ever. This will allow capabilities not only for users, citizens, and visitors, but also for the city when it comes to better planning, anticipation, insights, and analytics. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of your latest technological projects and their expected impact on society?</h4><p>TRA, in line with the UAE Vision 2021, continuously works to facilitate new ICT technologies in the UAE for the happiness of its citizens. Our future enables students to make their career decisions at an early stage of their lives. Virtual reality takes them through exploration journeys in different professions that are needed in the UAE. The system also provides a gamified assessment experience to test students' skills and interests and provide them with recommended professions. Our vision is to boost the efficiency of our future manpower to drive the nation ahead. Moreover, we undertook a project to install a low power FM radio station at Sheikh Hazza Bin Zayed Stadium in Al Ain to relay real-time commentary to the people of determination in terms of visual ability through special headsets. This innovative project was shortlisted and appreciated at the Ideas UK competition as well.</p><h4>What are your plans to make government services more efficient and accessible?</h4><p>Our focus for the next period is on service integration and connectedness. We need to focus on quality and excellence in order to increase satisfaction and happiness. In this sense, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, UAE Vice President and Prime Minister, and Ruler of Dubai, has stressed the four directions that we need to work on: quality, usage, satisfaction, and integration. In addition, we are exploring new trends in digital government, of which data exchange and data analysis are key components. As such, we are developing a new approach, linking e-government services with the new trends related to the fourth industrial revolution such as the AI, IoT, big data, and so on.</p><h4>What is your perspective on the need to establish synergies between the telecommunication and media sectors?</h4><p>As the media and telecoms sectors become increasingly interrelated, the synergies between the two sectors are an opportunity to enable the capabilities and technologies to be captured and used in the best way possible. TRA works closely with all the broadcasters and specialized media zones for the broadcasting and radio frequencies for transmission and ancillary requirements. While enabling such synergies, TRA will continue to enforce the Telecommunications Law to protect consumers. Today, ICT has made it easy for everyone to have their own media channel and make their voices heard. This indicates huge opportunities for the future of the media landscape. This is why in our smart government initiative, we focus on eParticipation as a methodology to increase the role of the public in designing policies and services.</p><h4>How does TRA work with private and public sector partners to further its own goals and the development of the UAE economy?</h4><p>It is essential to consider the interests and needs of the consumers and the industry players—whether public or private—when regulating the sector. Thus, TRA works closely with the various industry players, including telecommunications operators, technology developers, content providers, as well as other stakeholders. The industry has established its own group representing members' interests, and TRA has established another open forum to include the sector in the development of regulations. This is particularly relevant when it comes to issues related to the development of technologies. The UAE National Agenda highlights the importance of infrastructure and aims for the UAE to be among the best in the world. The UAE Vision 2021 assigned TRA as the main sponsor of the Networked Readiness Index (NRI) and set a target to become among the top-10 countries in the world. NRI is a composite indicator that measures the readiness of a country to capture opportunities provided by information and communication technology to increase competitiveness. As sponsor of NRI, TRA works closely and coordinates with the public and private sectors to implement initiatives to improve of relevant indicators. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will the Panama Metro reshape the infrastructure landscape of Panama, and what is its importance for the country?</h4><p>The long-term view for the Metro is a total of seven or eight lines, depending on certain factors. However, we are talking about a fairly robust network and have done the planning for this through 2040. The first line was a USD2-billion investment since there was an 8km tunnel. Line 2 is longer than the first, at 21km, and will have 16 stations and 21 trains of five cars each. We have been increasing ridership for the whole metro and are now at double the expected number of daily passengers. For Line 1, we originally calculated around 140,000 daily passengers, but we have days with nearly 300,000, and the average is hovering around 280,000. This has made us place an order for additional cars. We are buying 70 new cars for Line 1. This purchase will be for both Line 1 and to cover extra demand for feeding passengers from Line 2. We are changing the fleet from trains of three to five cars each, thus increasing the capacity of each train considerably. We hope we can cope with the increasing demand: the metro is the number-one entity in public satisfaction. We are always above 80%, which gives us a great deal of happiness. We are proud to have done something that has really changed people's lives for the better in Panama.</p><h4>How are you working to instill a metro-related culture and promote its use?</h4><p>This is one of our strong points even though it has never been done before. We have a program called Metro Cultura that has many different facets. There are free concerts in the metro on some Saturdays, which people have really taken a liking to. We also have installed free libraries where one can pick up and drop off books. This was done in alliance with the Lions Club and has been successful. We also bring poor kids from the countryside who have never seen a metro to the capital, give them a free ride, and teach them about how we built it.</p><h4>What are some of the challenges and obstacles you face on a daily basis?</h4><p>We are running Line 1 right now and finishing the second and starting the third at the same time. We started Line 2 a year and a half ago, and line 3 is even longer and will go over the upcoming fourth bridge over the Canal. Line 3 is 2.5km long and will be a monorail instead of a normal train because there are many hills. Our metro is the only one in Central America, and the monorail will be the only one of its kind in all of Central or South America, except Sío Paulo. This is a robust Hitachi monorail with the latest technology and the biggest model. We consider this project a case study; it is important for us and for the Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA). Japanese Prime Minister Abe has been helpful, not to mention our own President Varela. We will publish the TDRs for the seven pre-qualified companies in the coming months and will then have a period of about six months for participants to submit their proposals. We hope to award the contract to the winning contractor at the end of 2018; construction should start in 1Q2019.</p><h4>What are your main targets, ambitions, and goals for the coming year?</h4><p>Our immediate goals are to finish line 2 and the bid for the extension to the airport. The Panama airport will go from 13 million passengers to somewhere closer to 18-20 million passengers once the new terminal is open; we must capitalize on this. The immediate goal is to finish line 2 and the extension to the airport, and ideally finish Line 3 by 2023. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[grandeur-on-the-gulf]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What differentiates Bahia Grand Hotel from other hotels in the city?</h4><p>Panama has many great hotels. The market has significantly expanded, especially over the last few years and is penetrated by most international brands. The difference with the Bahia Grand Hotel is that it is the only one in the center of the city that is located directly on the ocean. Even though the hotel is centrally located, the neighborhood is calm and tranquil, a kind of urban oasis. Moreover, the hotel is housed within the tallest building in Central America, and our rooms, at 600sqft on average, are the largest the city has to offer.</p><h4>How did the hotel evolve from being a Trump hotel to the Bahia Grand?</h4><p>This hotel opened in mid-2011, and the prior owners faced many financial difficulties for a number of years. In August 2017, we acquired majority interest in the hotel with the consent of all the parties, including the prior owners and the debt holders. We attempted to work with the prior operator to remedy its contractual breaches and resolve the major issues, but that did not work. As a result, the agreement was terminated. The hotel is now independently run as the Bahia Grand. We chose the name because it is directly on the Gulf of Panama.</p><h4>How would you assess the tourism sector in Panama?</h4><p>Tourism in Panama is in the embryonic stage; Panama has about 2 million visitors per year, though only a few hundred thousand are leisure tourists. Mostly, people come for business. We have to compare these few hundred thousand leisure tourists in Panama to 4 million in Costa Rica. This is the most interesting comparison that demonstrates the potential of the country. If we start comparing Costa Rica to Panama, it has similar nature and environmental aspects—though Panama's rainforest is mostly primary whilst the one of Costa Rica mostly secondary. Moreover, Panama has approximately 600 islands whilst Costa Rica only has a few. In terms of connectivity, Panama has an advantage over Costa Rica, with Tocumen International Airport in Panama City serving almost 15 million passengers. Furthermore, Panama City benefits from a metropolis with skyscrapers, nightlife, and restaurants at a by-far larger scale than San José. This is complemented by the colonial part of the city, Casco Viejo. Thus, there is no reason why Panama should not have the same number of or more tourists than Costa Rica. Panama does, however, lack tourist infrastructure; in other words, it is difficult to reach areas of interest with organized transport, whilst there are less resorts and organized recreational activities. Secondly, Costa Rica has done a great job in branding itself as being eco-friendly. Panama has to do a better job in that regard, both from the government and the private sector. The private sector has been carrying this burden, and for the first time, the government seems to be taking certain positive steps in that direction with a new tourism fund.</p><h4>What are your plans for expansion in the region and priorities for the year ahead?</h4><p>Our investment mandate is to invest in hotels in the east coast of the US and the northern part of Latin America. The market is overheating in the US now; therefore, it is difficult to acquire hotels at attractive prices. We typically acquire assets at a deep discount to their replacement cost. We still have a great deal of capital to deploy and, in addition to the US, we are looking at Panama and other parts of Latin America. Given the time in the real estate cycle, Panama is bound to offer many interesting investment opportunities. We now want to control costs, increase revenues, and enhance both the international and local business. The goals for Ithaca Capital is to deploy more funds and execute transactions not only in Panama but the region in general. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the evolution of Arcos Dorados in Panama and in Central America over the years?</h4><p>After Costa Rica, Panama was the second country in Latin America to have the presence of McDonald's. Since 1971, when the first McDonald's opened, more than 60,000 Panamanians have been part of the McDonald's family. Arcos Dorados started its operations in Panama in 2007, and it is the largest franchise of McDonald's in the world and has the exclusive right to own and operate the brand in 20 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. During these 11 years in the region, the company has established more than 2,100 McDonald's restaurants. Until 2007, Panama had 36 McDonald's, but that number has almost doubled over the past 11 years, reaching more than 70 restaurants nationwide. Our success is based on five fundamental principles that are part of the brand promise: quality, service, cleanliness, value, and experience. Those who help us guarantee the fulfillment of these maxims and lead the operation are our collaborators, out of which 80% are young people between the ages of 18 and 22; we focus on giving them constant training through digital platforms and training centers, special benefits, and growth opportunities.</p><h4>With more than 70 restaurants in Panama. What are your next expansion plans?</h4><p>We keep our commitment to Panama, which is evident in our leadership and competitiveness in the fast food category during these 47 years. We are committed, in every action, to the communities in which we operate, promoting entrepreneurial spirit and operating with economic, social, and environmental responsibility. The constant growth of the brand is reflected throughout the last 10 years, during which we have operated more than 70 restaurants and nearly 40 dessert kiosks, reaching areas such as Changuinola, Penonomé, Colón, and central provinces, among others. Each new restaurant represents nearly 50 new jobs, offering an opportunity for young people who wish to enter the workforce for the first time, as well as an important boost to the local economy.</p><h4>What do you identify as the main differences between the Panamanian market and the rest?</h4><p>Each market is different; the secret to success is knowing the particularities of each market and the tastes and preferences of our clients. As a franchise in charge of the operation of the restaurants of Latin America and the Caribbean, Arcos Dorados must adhere to the global guidelines established by McDonald's. This implies the compliance of all the quality standards, security controls, global guides for restaurant design, and brand image management. We adapt to local tastes, offering our customers exclusive products both permanently and for special moments of the year. For example, in Panama we offer Desayuno Tí­pico, which has the option of corn tortilla or yucca and meat croquettes, accompanied by sausage, pressed white cheese, and scrambled eggs, a favorite dish in the countryside. Such initiatives enable the company to cater to the needs and wants of different countries in which we operate.</p><h4>What are your main objectives for Arcos Dorados for the coming year?</h4><p>Since its arrival to Panama in 2007, the company has invested nearly USD50 million in the expansion of the brand and in educating, training, and developing its collaborators. In terms of our future plans, we will continue with the strategic expansion plan in the country while keeping our commitment of providing our customers with high-quality products, service, and offers. Moreover, we cannot forget the impact of the generation of youth employment. In Panama, we are the leading fast food company in terms of opportunities for new workers, because we believe young Panamanians to be the leaders of our restaurants. The average age of our management staff is 27 years, a number that dips to 22 years for our regular collaborators. The people we employ are the biggest reason behind our growth and success.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[premium-panama]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been the evolution of the group over the years and its main achievements?</h4><p>Grupo Davissa has specialized in the distribution of premium brands in Panama, Colombia, and the Dominican Republic. World-renowned brands such as Apple and Nespresso have relied on us for our experience, knowledge of the market, and the added value we strive to give all our customers in the countries where we operate. The years 2016 and 2017 were undoubtedly important in the history of Grupo Davissa, since it acquired the use of Mac Centers and Mac Stores, located in Colombia and Panama, respectively. This has served to consolidate a premium operation that we had already led with Nespresso and became an important turning point with the opening of the boutique at Multiplaza Panamá. We can serve the client directly, providing a personalized experience at the hands of our coffee specialists. In the future, we want to consolidate Panama as a hub in Central America from the second half of 2019. This not only implies the opening of new sales channels, but also the implementation of our e-commerce platform, which will be operating in Panama toward the third quarter of 2018, and a call center to serve our customers more immediately.</p><h4>How would you divide the percentage of revenue for Panama in terms of Nespresso and Mac Store?</h4><p>Both brands have a specific and strategic relevance for the operation of the group in Panama as well as the region. Beyond profits, what is important to highlight is that Grupo Davissa aims to expand the participation of each of the countries through an important investment portfolio. We currently have eight Mac Store stores plus the online store, and a Nespresso store. Our focus is to be multi-channel; we are working to be accessible through several different sales channels but also offer our customers the same shopping experience through these channels using a solid technological base and excellent customer loyalty programs.</p><h4>What are the particularities of the Panamanian consumer?</h4><p>The Panamanian consumer is knowledgeable, demanding, and sophisticated. Our clients do not seek traditional sales but can experiment with the product through personalized consulting. We work continuously in this aspect in our stores and also in our training area, so that salespeople learn to poll customers and identify their needs. We are proud of the customer service standards that are given in our store. For example, at Nespresso, our specialists show the entire boutique to the clients and accompany them throughout the entire experience in a personalized and scrupulous manner. We want to make sure they are completely satisfied and that their needs are met. On the other hand, we know that buying an Apple product represents an important investment on the part of our customers; therefore, we strive to advise them so they have the guarantee that they made an excellent investment backed by the service. The Apple customer in Panama is characterized by wanting to know the product thoroughly. Therefore, we have a training area to teach our customers to use all the features of their equipment more efficiently, optimizing the storage capacity and the configuration.</p><h4>What are your goals and priorities for 2018?</h4><p>We want to strengthen our operations in Panama. With Nespresso, we hope to grow through the opening of commercial points where customers can access our machines; besides temporary points of sale where they can obtain capsules, as a physical alternative to the call center and the e-commerce platform. With respect to Mac Store, we want to strengthen the experience of customers in our stores. Our store in Multiplaza will be the largest in Latin America at 330sqm. Finally, we will strengthen the distribution and logistics processes to receive new brands. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you define the core strategy of Airbus in the Africa and Middle East region and its relations with suppliers and MROs?</h4><p>Airbus is extremely proud of the strong and positive presence that it has established in the Middle East and Africa over the last four decades. We employ more than 3,000 people across these two regions. We are committed to supporting the development and growth of sustainable aerospace sectors in both regions. We feel that there is tremendous potential for the further growth and expansion of the aviation sector in the Middle East especially, and our strategy takes this into account. We are committed to maintaining strong alliances and partnerships with key drivers in the aviation sector and interlinked industries. While we have developed a number of strategic partnerships to enhance operations, we are also launching key initiatives to further advance the aviation industry in the region, as it plays an essential role in economic diversification. We can cite several examples of our deep and growing relationships with regional OEMs and suppliers. In the UAE, Airbus works with Strata Manufacturing, a Mubadala company, and TPI of Tawazun Group directly and via Tier-1 suppliers including FACC, SAAB, and SABCA. In Morocco and Tunisia, strategic partnerships that we have developed via STELIA, a 100% subsidiary of Airbus, have played an instrumental role in enabling both countries to act as major suppliers on all Airbus programs and provides them great benefits in terms of employment and developing industrial capabilities. We aim to leverage new digital technologies to help transform the regional MRO industry and expect that they will appeal to both MRO centers as well as technicians. We have the support of a number of quality MROs in Saudi Arabia and the UAE and continue to invest in these partnerships. We are also a proud partner of leading airlines in the region. The distinctive livery of Middle East-based airline brands, including Emirates, Etihad Airways, Saudi Arabian Airlines, Kuwait Airways, Air Arabia, and others, adorns the gleaming tails and fuselages of the latest Airbus aircraft.</p><h4>How does Airbus industrial partnership approach exemplify standards of cooperation between an OEM and local players in the region and in the UAE?</h4><p>With the aim of further developing the region's aviation sector, in a market that is of high strategic importance to Airbus and to the global aviation industry, Airbus has invested in the regional industrial footprint through numerous commercial agreements and partnerships in several countries such as the UAE, Tunisia, and Morocco. Airbus partners in these countries include local organizations from both public and private sectors and international institutions. Not only does this contribute to Airbus' global supply chain efficiency, but it also creates opportunities for skills development and the stimulation of new revenue streams for local economies. It also provides important incubators for local talent to address the global talent shortages that exist in the ever-growing fields of aviation and aerospace. In the UAE, Strata Manufacturing produces composite components for the A330, A330neo, A350 XWB, and A380 aircraft while TPI produces metallic parts for the A320, A320neo, and A330 models. In both Morocco and Tunisia, Airbus suppliers and Airbus subsidiary Stelia utilize a highly skilled workforce and take advantage of the proximity to Europe to source a mix of machined, composite, electrical, and assembled components across all Airbus programs.</p><h4>Which sectors have the most potential to lead opportunities in the future?</h4><p>Airbus is a future-facing organization, and we are actively working to shape the future of aerospace. Aerospace globally has immense potential and has proven to be a catalyst for economic development. In the Middle East, passenger traffic is doubling every 10-15 years; traffic is growing worldwide by about 4.4%, though in the region it is more than 5.8%; and the epicenter of air traffic globally has shifted from the US 30 years ago to Saudi Arabia today. This explains the success of Dubai as the largest transit passenger air hub in the world, and it can handle up to 250 million passengers a year. The region has witnessed incredible growth in its vision for space-related pursuits and Airbus is committed to bringing innovation and developing sustainable partnerships that endure and transform this field. As Europe's number-one space enterprise and the second-largest space business worldwide, Airbus Defence and Space provides a broad range of products, capabilities, and systems to countries in the region. Airbus has built numerous telecom satellites for customers in the Middle East, including operators such as Arabsat (KSA), Nilesat (Egypt), and Yahsat (UAE). Arabsat 6B/Badr-7 is based on the Eurostar E3000 platform, which is recognized worldwide as the most reliable in its class.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main accomplishments and milestones for MBRSC over the past year?</h4><p>2017 was a busy year for MBRSC; in April of 2017, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum and Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan visited the center and re-launched the UAE national space program, placing it under the auspices of MBRSC. The national program consists of four main initiatives, the first being the UAE satellite development program, which is based in South Korea in collaboration with South Korean partners. Thus far, the program has successfully launched three satellites and will soon launch a satellite—designed, built, and tested in the UAE—from Japan in 4Q2018. Our second initiative is the Mars exploration program, which is the Arab world's first mission to the red planet. Since Mars presents similar challenges and conditions to the UAE's own challenges, the third initiative is the Mars 2117 Strategy: a century-long strategy aimed at establishing the first inhabitable human settlement on Mars by 2117. Additionally, we want to have a moonshot idea that empowers and inspires the youth. In 2017, we announced MBRSC's plan for a 2-million-sqft Mars Science City, which will be one of the largest Mars simulation cities on earth. The fourth and final initiative is the UAE Astronaut Program. As of March 2018, we had received 4,000 applications, of which 34% were women, 22% were pilots, and 60% were engineers and scientists. 2018 will be spent selecting the final four applicants who will represent the UAE astronaut corps, but only one individual will be chosen for the first space mission. The UAE is cementing its place in the field of space; last year, Dubai was chosen to host the International Astronautical Congress in 2020, which will be largest such gathering with around 6,000 attendees. </p><h4>How do you see the importance of MBRSC in the UAE's vision of being a knowledge-based economy?</h4><p>Space is one of the seven areas of activity the government has identified as a means of diversifying our economy away from hydrocarbons. Getting the youth involved is one of the ways to generate interest and activity, eventually creating numerous high-tech jobs. Since the field of space is a niche market, MBRSC is focused on ensuring that people with unique skillsets have a great place to work. Perhaps the largest way in which we contribute to the UAE vision is through inspiration. If we can show the youth of the country that we can go to Mars, we will be able to inspire them to further transform the country for the better. <br>How can the UAE's economy take advantage of the research and technological development at MBRSC?<br>The Mars Science City is one such project because the technologies or resources developed to go to Mars can be utilized to meet challenges in the UAE. Additionally, developing satellites requires a technological infrastructure that creates relevant data for a number of ministries. For example, the program will provide Dubai with imaging technologies that will allow officials to easily and effectively track changes in the metropolitan area. We are developing another satellite specifically for the Dubai Municipality to detect CO2 emissions from the city. They have a carbon networking station on the ground, and this satellite will serve to verify the data they are collecting. The vast amount of data that will be collected will have a vital impact on the lives of citizens in the UAE and around the globe.</p><h4>What will be the significance of the launch of KhalifaSat for the development of the UAE's space industry?</h4><p>The launch of KhalifaSat will be one of the biggest steps in the space program. By undergoing a process of knowledge transfer over the last 15 years, the UAE now has the capability to design and build its own satellites. Similarly, the UAE can now partner with other countries to develop their space programs. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What major learning points is the UAE Space Agency taking from the financial and legal framework being set up for the Mars mission?</h4><p>We were also mandated by the government to create a sustainable space program and to do so we need quality and precision, which requires us to work by the book. People are busy with social and political problems, though we are trying to show our regional neighbors that even in these hard times, through science and technology, one can regain world respect. We are working on a Space Law and will be one of the few countries with a comprehensive space regulatory framework. Our space program is for peaceful reasons, and it requires long-term planning, focusing on human capacity and the next space engineers. This is where we work with universities and research centers, and push for social media and awareness campaigns.</p><h4>How does the UAE Space Agency seek to strike a balance between transferring technology skills and knowledge and maintaining control over its intellectual property?</h4><p>We are hungry for knowledge and cooperating with international space agencies provides a fantastic overlap. We need to work and engage with people in a practical way. We send people to work with international agencies to be exposed to what other scientists are doing and the best practices. We are active; we have signed over 20 agreements and have established an international advisory committee. We want to receive advice from people from all over the world, each with their own sectorial knowledge, within the space industry. We meet twice a year and they help us engage with different stakeholders.</p><h4>Where should further research efforts and investments be made and why?</h4><p>The government has also announced the Mars 2117 project, which aims to establish the first city on Mars. It is a realistic plan to have humans on Mars. Our environment is not that different from Mars. We face the same challenges. For example, Mars today is a desert, with no atmosphere; however, we can see and tell from the structure of the planet that water once existed there. The international science community wants to understand the mystery of why water disappeared to prevent the same from happening here. The Gulf region is similar in some way to Mars' surface. If the best scientists in the world are employed to solve issues on Mars, spin-off solutions will be applied on Earth. That is how most inventions in fact come to be used in our daily lives. This is why the UAE government decided to engage in the plan of building a Mars scientific city in Dubai to solve issues.</p><h4>What is the best way forward to attract and promote young Emiratis to become space scientists and technology pioneers?</h4><p>The UAE has announced a plan to establish a human space flight program to develop astronauts. These are all big projects that have spurred a great deal of interest from young people. Our regional neighbors are looking on with curiosity at our efforts. Most international space agencies come here because they appreciate what we are doing in this small country.</p><h4>How can the UAE spacy industry develop a solid private ecosystem?</h4><p>We are putting in place the right regulation to attract and protect investment in the UAE space program. The government is funding exploration missions, though we want to see the private sector play a greater role, similar to YahSat for example, in bringing value and assets into the country. I assisted to the launch of Al Yah 3 satellite, which will provide vital connectivity to over 600 million people in Brazil and South America. We are also looking at strategies to attract international investors, working with local governments. We are harvesting the space program to showcase the world our competitive advantage. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does DRC's new site at Dubai Investment Park help the company maintain an edge over its competitors?</h4><p>Moving to our new site gave us the capability to start producing two new products—Aquafina and Lipton Ice Tea. It also enabled us to produce our product range in significantly larger quantities. Another benefit is that with newer equipment, we can produce more efficiently, using less energy and water. The new infrastructure also allows us to open up new lines of business. For example, we signed an agreement with Froneri Ice Cream Egypt in 2017 to distribute Nestlé ice cream. We are continuing to expand and are in talks with several parties to add further lines of business. </p><h4>Which F&amp;B segments do you target in particular?</h4><p>We are always interested in the beverage segment. Our partner is PepsiCo, which has a wide product portfolio, and we have ongoing discussions with PepsiCo to expand the range available in the UAE. On the food side, we focus on packaged products where we have synergies with the products we sell for PepsiCo. One of the things we recently launched is a range of snacks called Snack Time that sell in the same channels where we sell our beverages. We look for new products that maximize the synergies with our existing product portfolio and that we can sell through the distribution channels in which we are already strong.</p><h4>What are the main innovations that have been incorporated into new facilities?</h4><p>Innovation comes in different forms. It can be new products and packages that we launch, or innovation in terms of how we go to market. There can be things that are less visible, such as efficiency, services, or logistics and storage. Often for an industry, innovation is more about these types of operational improvements rather than just about launching new products. It is important for us to improve our level of service through innovation; for example, we have programs that improve our distribution routes. We also innovate in our manufacturing processes to use fewer and more lightweight materials to save money. We innovate in terms of quality control to ensure that every product is of exactly the same high quality. We have even incorporated innovation into the building and its management. We are currently awarding the job of installing solar panels over 60,000sqm of roof, which will generate almost 4MW of power. This will be one of the largest solar installations of its kind in Dubai.</p><h4>What makes DRC an attractive partner for businesses that want to establish their brands in the UAE market?</h4><p>We have some tremendous advantages in both manufacturing and distribution. DRC is one of the strongest distribution companies in the UAE in terms of coverage breadth and depth. We perhaps reach more customers in our territory than anyone in the FMCG business. Moreover, we reach customers more frequently than anyone else, which help sus deliver a superior level of service level. We can also execute marketing activities in a way that companies with more limited capabilities cannot. DRC is one of the top companies in the UAE in terms of distribution and execution. In terms of manufacturing, we represent a tremendous opportunity for companies coming from Europe, the US, and other places that currently have their supply chain coming out of their home countries or regions. Generally speaking, these big markets do not have the flexibility to produce specifically for the Middle East market. Often by the time products arrive in the UAE, a significant portion of the shelf life has expired. DRC can do the job here; our infrastructure is ready and we are plug and play. We can set up a customer-designed manufacturing process quickly, efficiently, and at great value. We are happy to sign long-term contracts with serious partners. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[A Picture of  Success]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[a-picture-of-success]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess the performance of Jotun UAE in the past year?</h4><p>Our main accomplishment in the past year was our success in maintaining our number-one position in the market. We are also proud to have achieved this through growth in all the business segments that we operate in, which includes decorative retail and projects, protective coatings, and marine. We had a great year with several significant developments and achievements. Firstly, we had a year without any fatalities or major incidents in our operations. On the environmental front, we certified many of our coating systems according to new international green LEED standards. We have shown major strength both in decorative paints and marine products. Our breadth of operations ranges from painting individuals' homes to iconic and distinguished landmarks in the UAE, including Burj Khalifa and Burj Al Arab. Meanwhile, our marine products cater to private elite yachts as well as large oil tankers. Moreover, Jotun protects numerous steel structures from fire and corrosion though its state-of-the-art protective assortment. This defines the quality of our paint and coatings and further exemplifies our ability to supply projects of such a size and scale. It is not only about the paint, but the entire team—from the technical department, to sales, aftersales, and customer service.</p><h4>What is the relevance of Dubai for Jotun's operations internationally?</h4><p>Although the size we cover is not that large geographically, Dubai is a vital location in our global operations, and we see a positive future for at least the next two and a half years. When we look at our business in the UAE's construction and residential segments, we see both iconic, remarkable projects that achieve great volume as well as strong brand awareness among individuals and homeowners. In terms of operations, Dubai is the biggest production hub that supplies emerging countries in the region. That is not only because of the production capacity of our plant in Dubai, but also because of the advanced logistics in Dubai that make our operations smooth and efficient. Another general driver for growth in Jotun is being a leader in innovation, which follows Dubai's vision of being the most innovative city in the world. This vision reflects our boldness in launching innovative products and our global and regional concepts and processes. Innovation has sustained our growth and leading position for the last 25 years. For example, we have a full training and development concept for the retail segment that ensures an excellent shopping experience for end users at our stores. A year ago, we launched Fenomastic Wonderwall, a long lasting, high-quality paint that provides a smooth surface and is easy to apply; it generated 1 million liters in sales in first year of launch. In May, we launched ColourDesign, a mobile application that simplifies the process of color matching for interior and exterior walls. Jotun has three R&amp;D hubs: Norway, Malaysia, and the UAE. Considering the unique climate trends in Dubai, we have a full R&amp;D setup here to develop concepts and products adapted to this region. Dubai is more than a sales office located in a country; it is a regional hub for Jotun. </p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead, and what will be your main objectives?</h4><p>Our main objectives are growing our business profitably, ensuring the best purchase experience for our customers, keeping up with innovations, and making our operations greener and safer for our employees and stakeholders. My expectations for Jotun's performance in the UAE are extremely positive. One of our key strengths is that we have been established in the UAE for 41 years. Being in Dubai for this length of time has proven to be a great success for Jotun and has given us a competitive edge over our competitors. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have your operations evolved to gain brand recognition in the Middle East? </h4><p>Eaton has been in the Middle East for 40 years. We had our first office in Dubai in the World Trade Center, and over the past 20 years we have grown significantly through a number of acquisitions that expanded our installed bases capacity. In 2013 we decided to double our investments in the region, setting up a manufacturing facility in Dubai to get closer to our clients. This process has led us to an approach that establishes support mechanisms for our customers through more tailored solutions, and the growth of Dubai as an Emirate has undoubtedly favored our operations. Indeed, Dubai acts pretty much as the regional benchmark: once we establish a relationship with a Dubai partner, it is then easier to engage in its counterpart somewhere else in the region. This has been the case with Dubai Civil Defense, for example with which we have established a great working relationship in our Life Safety Division.</p><h4>What is the level of security and standardization of power equipment plays within commercial construction in the region?</h4><p>Bringing safety to the construction market, whether that is in hospitals, houses, offices, or other buildings, remains a key priority for Eaton. One of the key challenges in the region is ensuring the equipment specifications meet the right standards to deliver high-level solutions to a different number of stakeholders. Counterfeit products sold at cheaper prices is another issue our industry always had to deal with, but safety should not come at any compromise. Eaton has more than 10,000 patents and we are constantly working to develop or evolve products in order to meet specific market needs and safety requirements. However, there has been growing awareness in the market around the importance of security of the generation system, which has allowed for greater innovation in certain niche areas. For example, we have been able to upgrade evacuation processes both in terms of emergency lightning and fire detection, making the whole system dynamic through the implementation of technology. Another example is the introduction of the arc flash detecting system.</p><h4>What is your assessment on the wave of investments in data centers the region is witnessing?</h4><p>Investments in data centers, especially in the technology for data protection, is becoming increasingly important in the region, whether it is the server present in buildings or all the way to big colocation sites. As such, Eaton is proud to supply all the protective equipment and UPS for the Gulf Data Hub, one of the first large data colocation center in the region. Safety and security are absolutely paramount for companies to build strong, well-tested, reliable foundations, both in hardware and software. This enhanced connectivity and higher amount of data presents companies and governments with huge potential, but people need to understand what it actually means. It all boils down to the intelligence of the network, and how we can take the data, turn it into really usable information that people can make decisions on. There are big steps being made in this direction, and it is an exciting time overall.</p><h4>Can you walk us through the changes innovation brings to the region's utilities market?</h4><p>The structure of the current network system in the Middle East dates back to the 1970s and 1980s, which calls for major equipment upgrade and substitution to prevent issues with transformers, oil insulated switchgears, and so on. Since all major cities in the region are witnessing infrastructure growth, new built is often required, though the typical utility model based on power stations connected to substations through endless transmission lines is coming to an end. Today, the utility space is becoming more fragmented, with a more localized grid. Europe is already undergoing this shift, and the Middle East is starting to see it right now. There will be a massive change in the way utilities are operated. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Here for Regulatory Environment]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[here-for-regulatory-environment]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does FANR play in advancing the country's regulatory environment around nuclear energy?</h4><p>We have established ourselves not only as a functioning regulatory body to enforce safety, security, and non-proliferation for nuclear energy, but also as an organization that supervises hospitals, dentists, and all those institutions that need licenses for sophisticated machines that emit radiation. As outlined by our management board, to become globally recognized as a leading nuclear regulator, we need to achieve excellence in our operations, like most UAE institutions.  We are presently reviewing the operating license application for Unit 1 of the Barakah plant and need to make sure it is built according to international standards and FANR regulations before we award the operating license. The long length of this concession requires a rigorous process of supervision over safety issues and the consideration to security requirements. Also, the potential impact on the environment is part of the FANR review efforts.</p><h4>What is the estimated economic impact of the Barakah power plant on the UAE market in the context of UAE Vision 2021?</h4><p>This is the first time since 1985 that a new country is introducing nuclear power, and the reason for this investment is strategic, as nuclear energy seeks to save the country from oil dependency and reduce the environmental impact of electricity production. In this context, the Barakah nuclear power plant will provide stable and reliable electricity across the UAE and provide a new career path for the economy and youth. In order to be fully operational, numerous skills are required in various sectors, from basic science and engineering to legal advising. Initially, at FANR, expats such as myself came to set up, mentor, and train. Eventually we will leave space to nationals. In our efforts to support the Emiratization process, we initially started hiring from local industry and governmental institutions as well as from universities to train groups of students before moving them into the appropriate departments. Presently, we have over 220 staff members, of which 64% are Emiratis, whom we have trained in nuclear and radiation regulation to be able to assume leading expert or management roles in the nuclear sector.</p><h4>What is the importance of building an integrated network with local and international authorities?</h4><p>In the same way nuclear vendors and operators have transformed into global players, nuclear regulation has been impacted by globalization as well. In line with the need for continuous improvement and ensuring maximum safety of the public, workers, and the environment, we need to strengthen our regulatory programs on nuclear safety, security, radiation protection, and safeguards. Forming international partnerships where information and experience is exchanged between regulatory authorities, as well as increasing support from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has so far resulted in stronger, more robust regulatory frameworks all over the globe. Likewise for FANR, partnerships with local and international entities play an indispensable role. It establishes a platform for cooperation, support, and the exchange of information and knowledge. Locally, FANR has 15 agreements and MoUs signed with federal and local government agencies that help nurture our mission and provide the means to regulate the nuclear sector. FANR has signed 19 agreements and MoUs with international organizations and regulatory authorities of other countries to share technical information, exchange experience and lessons learned as well help in building national capacity in nuclear and radiation. Thanks to these cooperation agreements, FANR has contributed strongly to the nuclear sector by creating the legal and regulatory framework to be followed, adopting and enforcing regulations for the nuclear industry that align with international standards, and inspecting the compliance with these regulations to ensure public health and safety and ensuring the peaceful uses of it. The work of FANR and its partners is continuously enhancing the nuclear safety culture in the UAE. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess ENOC's contribution to the development and growth of Dubai?</h4><p>ENOC's management explored the potential of Dubai's energy assets, using primitive maps to navigate dusty roads, when the group was established in 1993. Today, the group has a swathe of first-rate infrastructure projects, generated USD13.8 billion in economic value for Dubai in 2016 and recorded a total of 249 million barrels in 2017 alone. The group's initial payroll of 200 people has soared to 11,000 employees today. ENOC's tremendous growth rate reflects its deep commitment to supporting Dubai's transformation over the last 25 years. In 2015, the government announced that it would eliminate subsidies on diesel and gasoline, significantly spurring ENOC's financial growth. At a time when lower oil prices since 2014 have forced most of the world's energy companies to rein in their expenditure, ENOC has had the strategic capacity to broaden its scope. The group recognized the importance of gaining full access to the value chain and moved forward with the full acquisition of Dragon Oil in 2015 that became the group's exploration and production arm. This acquisition was a game changer for ENOC, transforming it into a fully integrated oil and gas player. </p><h4>How is ENOC taking up and implementing new technologies that promote sustainability in its operations? </h4><p>The success of ENOC's inaugural solar-powered service station at the entrance of Dubai Internet City (DIC) on Sheikh Zayed Road means the zero-carbon technology has now led us to move forward with phase two of our plans: to include solar photovoltaic (PV) panels in all future service stations leading up to 2020. Since then, we have successfully opened three solar powered service stations across the UAE. Our ongoing transformation of existing infrastructure into independently powered energy pods brings a myriad of benefits and illustrates the value of rapidly evolving green technologies. Creating solar-powered service stations supports the Dubai Electricity and Water Authority's (DEWA) capacity growth at a time of rising demand. Smart energy management will underpin Dubai's transformation into a low-carbon and globally competitive knowledge-based economy, with renewable technologies playing a leading role. The PV panels will generate a total of 6.5MWh—the equivalent of powering 1,700 homes in Dubai and saving 16,000 tons of CO2 emissions in one year.</p><h4>What are your expectations around the impact of Expo 2020 on Dubai? </h4><p>Dubai is moving into a new phase of growth as the Emirate aims to attract 20 million visitors before Expo 2020, while 25 million unique visitors are expected during the event itself.  Undoubtedly these ambitions will increase the demand for energy and the need for critical infrastructure. Our appointment as the Expo 2020 Integrated Energy Partner places a responsibility on us as a national oil company to continue investing in projects that will contribute to the development of the country's energy sector, such as the expansion of our refinery, the construction of the jet fuel pipeline to Al Maktoum International and our retail expansion plans across Dubai and the UAE. Part of our plans leading up to the Expo 2020 also include setting up a fully functioning, futuristic service station, using multiple energy sources, from solar to hydrogen, as well as traditional hydrocarbon sources.</p><h4>How will the jet fuel pipeline to Dubai South support Expo 2020 and fuel Dubai's economic growth? </h4><p>Set to be operational in time for Expo 2020, the 16.2km pipeline will carry 2,000cbm of jet fuel per hour to Al Maktoum International Airport. ENOC's network of jet fuel pipelines aims to meet the demand for jet fuel at Dubai Airports up until 2050. Eventually, Al Maktoum International is expected to become the world's largest airport with an annual capacity exceeding 220 million passengers and 16 million tonnes of cargo, and, hence, our commitment to build a pipeline to ensure an uninterrupted fuel supply will support the airport's demand for jet fuel up until 2050. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate the ministry's work during your mandate?</h4><p>If I had to evaluate it first at a general level and then at the level of the Ministry of Social Development (MIDES), the government of President Varela will go down in history as one that has been dedicated to addressing an unprecedented social agenda in the country and taking care of sectors that, for decades, had not been given a response in housing matters. Under the government, some 80,000 new housing units have been added. It is also the first time a government has dared to implement decentralization, and we are satisfied with a government that opted for dialog rather than force. Granted, it has been four difficult and intense years, but when we reach the end of our term, we can point out that we have many things to present to the country. The partnership with the private sector has allowed us to promote productive inclusion, and we are training many women who are heads of families through banks and universities. Of course, I cannot leave out the population with a disability: today, we have more than 20,000 people with severe disabilities whose needs are met through financial resources.</p><h4>The ministry's budget is around USD280 million. How do you distribute it? </h4><p>The budget in 2017 was about USD280 million, and it did not change much for 2018. As for its distribution, USD225 million is destined for investment in human capital and conditional economic transfers, though this is still insufficient. We have had the fortune of having sustained economic growth of 5-6%, which is great, but it is not enough. We must work on these public policies foreseeing the sustainability of the programs because it is useless to do this for two years if the economy recedes. I regret that we have been left too short in terms of infrastructure and would like to improve the service centers, but the infrastructure budget for MIDES is insufficient. However, the World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank have given MIDES a seven-year loan to equip centers for infant care technology.</p><h4>What is your strategy to cooperate with other ministries on social issues?</h4><p>From my own experience, I have open communication and friendship with the vast majority of the cabinet, especially those within the social branch such as the Ministry of Health, Education, Labor and Social Welfare, Environment, and Housing. In the same way, we maintain a good relationship with all other ministries.</p><h4>What are the challenges for the next minister?</h4><p>The political game is played through social programs, and the population has benefited from these programs, so whoever arrives will have to continue betting on equity and the distribution of wealth. The next minister has to understand that working as a team brings success. Finally, he or she cannot ignore civil society, international organizations, and the private sector; these are our allies for meeting our sustainable development objectives. Panama is showing that Agenda 2030 can be fulfilled even by 2025.</p><h4>What does it mean for you that MIDES is the most beloved public institution in the country, and what would you like to achieve before leaving?</h4><p>We take great pride in the public opinion polls, especially since the ministry was in a poor state when we took over. I have experienced the difficulties of poverty in my own life, which is why I know that social mobility is possible. In terms of objectives, I would like to eradicate extreme poverty and help our most vulnerable populations. These things are not done overnight, but we hope that the next government will have the same vocation as ours. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[never-ending-ambition]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the strategy behind your success in becoming the fastest-growing retail pharmaceutical company in Central America?</h4><p>We are proud to be the fastest-growing pharma company, and the key has been to invest heavily after establishing a solid base built through compliance, reputation, and quality. We invested aggressively, mostly in our people and marketing. This investment coupled with high quality products and compliant business practices set the foundation for a sustainable business that we will continue to grow in the future. Our products are now well positioned, and brand awareness is high among patients, doctors, pharmacies, distributors, and competitors; they all recognize the quality of ACINO products.</p><h4>What is your expansion strategy in Latin America?</h4><p>Our expansion plans come in different forms. First, we are looking to expand our portfolio by launching our own products and in-licensing products from other pharmaceutical companies in the geographies where we currently have a presence. This portfolio expansion is focused on products that fit our core therapeutic areas: pain and antibiotics. We are also looking for partners to out-license non-priority products that are not in that same core focus; for instance, we have good gastro or cardiovascular brands outside our main lines. Second, we are always looking to enter into new geographies where we have no presence currently, either through organic expansion or partnership with a leading company. We remain fairly aggressive in terms of growth, and we are always looking for selective acquisition targets or attractive portfolios to complement our product offering in the region.</p><h4>How does ACINO invest in medical education to promote its products?</h4><p>Our markets are extremely price sensitive, and because of our high-quality products, we cannot always compete on price. However, we can sustain a competitive price and beat the competition on quality and service, and we rely on medical education to highlight our differentiated galenic form and its benefits. Therefore, our strategy is to leverage a scientific approach by investing in educating doctors and pharmacists in the region via seminars and even via our highly trained medical representatives. The more knowledgeable the healthcare professionals, the easier it is for them to see the value and the difference our products make.</p><h4>What is your expectation for the year ahead?</h4><p>We expect sales growth of 15% in 2018 and are growing even faster year to date. We have reduced some expenses and operate as a leaner organization that enables us to react faster to opportunities and threats while delivering higher profit. We also expect to grow the institutional sector, and so far, we are exceeding expectations. It is easier to maintain such a high performance with a well-trained, knowledgeable, and motivated team.</p><h4>What are the main challenges of doing business in Panama in your sector?</h4><p>There is a war for talent in Panama at the moment, so we all fight to get and retain the best talent. Additionally, from our experience, the regulatory agency in Panama takes the most time to approve products compared to other regional countries, although we are seeing some improvements for high-quality products, which is a start to turn that challenge into an opportunity.</p><h4>What are your goals, priorities, and ambitions for ACINO for the year ahead?</h4><p>Our goals are to further increase brand awareness, challenge the status quo by exploring new and better ways to improve how we serve patients, and keep growing on top of our solid foundation. ACINO's 2018 priorities are to continue developing its people, training healthcare professionals, moving quickly when opportunities arise, and sustaining the core of our success: work as a team putting patients first. ACINO LATAM's ambition is to be the best place to work for its people and become the pharma company of choice for corporations looking to out-license their products. In the end, it all boils down to expand health and wellbeing in Latin America. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you evaluate your mandate during your term and especially in 2017?</h4><p>This needs to be evaluated according to the objectives I set at the start of my term. We drew three pillars for the Varela administration's health policy: a human resource plan that had never existed, primary health care aimed at changing the management model from a curative strategy to a preventive strategy, and health infrastructure. The public health system in Panama is a bicephalous system, where the social security fund and the Ministry of Health (MoH) are health providers. In 2014, a dialog was called for the transformation of the health system and three tables were set up: a human resources table, a transformation table, and an economic table. Significant distortion in the salaries of health professionals led to a human resource shortage. The yearly quota to study medicine in the University of Panama was increased by 100, of which 15% must be students from indigenous regions. Similarly, quotas were increased for nursing, nurse technicians, and clinical laboratories. Two previously closed careers of health promoters and vector inspectors were reopened. Within the transformation table, a white paper was created, which is the road map of the coordinated health system between the social insurance fund and the MoH, whose vision is that all people can be attended to in any health facility, regardless of whether the patient has social security. Moreover, we have made important changes in specific areas, such as the national pharmacy and drugs administration. The infrastructure costs dealt us a blow; it took between 18 and 24 months to release four hospitals for which construction had been halted by the previous administration. These hospitals are set to be completed by 1Q2019. Our plans for infrastructure are focused on the expansion and improvement of primary health centers.</p><h4>Regarding the budget of the ministry, in what areas has the budget been allocated?</h4><p>The budget of the MoH is a little over USD2 billion, representing almost 10% of the national budget of USD22 billion. Infrastructural investments take the biggest chunk of that budget at around USD700 million; the biggest infrastructure investment is the Panama Sanitation Program—a state project that has been through three administrations already. The four previously mentioned hospitals and other mega projects, such as a children's hospital and oncology hospital, make up our current list of major investments.</p><h4>How is Panama working to implement preventative care mechanisms?</h4><p>President Varela devised a strategy that is called national census of preventive health. Through this plan, Panamanians over 40 will be registered in the medical center closest to their residence before undergoing a series of examinations and tests. They are tested for four diseases from which 70% of Panamanians suffer: diabetes, high blood pressure, dyslipidemia, and obesity. The government wants to reduce the complications that these patients will suffer during the next 10 years. This is one of the strategies that I would push the incoming health minister to continue.</p><h4>What is the ministry doing in regard to counterfeit medicines in the pharmaceutical industry?</h4><p>Since the constitution states that all health professionals must be Panamanians, we have had to put a special effort into having inspectors keep a check on unskilled health professionals. We have invested in human resources for the national pharmacy and drugs administration, increasing the number of inspections for sanitary registrations and inspections by registration. We have made agreements with INVIMA of Colombia and with the Spanish agency of medicines and sanitary supplies to share database and knowledge of similar inspections. The ministry has developed a free app to increase access to technical health advice and find a list of registered health professionals. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did Gargash fare over the last year?</h4><p>2016 and 2017 were great years for Gargash, particularly in relation to new business and client acquisitions. The market was also augmented as a result of the introduction of compulsory employee benefits medical insurance by the government. When we look at the underlying strength of our portfolio in 2016, it was robust. We are dynamic and base our growth on various scenarios, while preparing our general capabilities to respond to and be proactive to emerging situations.</p><h4>How does Gargash cater to Indian expatriates?</h4><p>The reason why the insurance penetration levels are lower for Asian expatriates compared to the other expatriate communities is that insurance awareness is low in developing countries such as India. However, there is growing awareness because of the mandatory health insurance and exposure to other risks, which results in new sectors of the population getting informed and involved with the insurance business. For many Indians in Dubai, this is the first time they realize the advantages of the broad offerings of insurance companies. The life and protection insurance segment so far has especially low penetration levels because of the alleged transient nature of the expatriate population. However, over half of the expatriates here have been in Dubai for over 10 years. Most prefer to buy into pension schemes or similar products from their home country. The social security element in India is also rudimentary, unlike in Europe, where the government provides state pensions and public healthcare. In our experience the Indian attitude is still traditional: their children will look after them in their old age. However, with the globally increasing cost of healthcare and rising life expectancy, there is increasing awareness of the need for medical insurance in the Indian community, as well as need for pensions and savings.</p><h4>How do you reach out to the corporate community in Dubai?</h4><p>Since we cater to every business sector from construction to healthcare, hospitality, trading, and manufacturing, it is clear that Gargash has to be able to adapt to the dynamics of the evolving economy in Dubai. Gargash's corporate business is increasing at a faster rate than our individual client base. Today, our corporate clients make up about 65% of our business. When we started, it was the other way around. Our exposure has increased significantly in recent years, giving us an edge in acquiring new corporate customers.</p><h4>How is competition between international and local insurance intermediaries in the Dubai market is likely to develop?</h4><p>There is always a place for both international and local competitors in a market like Dubai. The presence of international insurance intermediaries is required here because they handle global accounts and insurance programs. Companies like Gargash with our global networks are in a strong position to compete with them. In the end, the customer will decide who best caters to their needs on the basis of the quality of service we provide. We need to have the best expertise on the ground as a local company, while international players can fall back on their global expertise, though that comes with a delay factor. From the clients' perspective, our edge is our expertise, network, and service. We are present in Dubai with a large organization and a well-established brand. Gargash is the only broker in Dubai accredited by the Chartered Insurance Institute in London as Chartered Insurance Brokers. This means we have in place an entire raft of systems, along with international compliance standards and annual audits for the benefit of our clients. We have maintained these standards for the last 11 years. This is the gold brand we carry, and it makes a difference. Our bench strength of qualified people on the ground is much bigger than that of our international competitors. They have far greater resources globally, but on the ground, we are stronger. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>To what extent is Takaful Emarat embracing new technology such as blockchain?</h4><p>We have two methods we plan to use. One is to create a digital platform. We would like to become the Uber of insurance, a platform where we do not need anyone working in the areas we have launched. We would like it to be scalable so that we can link up with anyone working around the world. We want to make an easy-to-use product for our insurance. Secondly, we would like to see technology that can help us do a risk-based analysis. If there are two people of the same age with the same Porsches but one is a poor driver, how will we know who to insure? We can either put a chip in the car or an app that can tell if someone is speeding or braking too hard or not using their turn signals. Based on positive driving behavior, premiums can be lower, which translates into fewer claims. This digital platform can in fact help us determine how much to charge and also help drivers think carefully about how they want to drive. With our recent new brand launch of “Tlife" for our life and health business and “Tinsure" for our general insurance business after the completion of the acquisition of Al Hilal Takaful, we now give our customers and partners a fresh perspective. Amusingly, our employees now refer to me as “Mr. T." This is not just a cosmetic update; however, there has been a tremendous amount of work gone into digitalizing our offering, including the launch of new websites for our existing business and the acquisition of Al Hilal Takaful; the introduction of a new enhanced health product that is sold and fulfilled digitally end-to-end; the introduction of Tbo, our new intelligent chat bot available across all our websites; a vibrant online community aimed at improving lifestyles, health, and wellness of our members; and beyond. We are also working on native mobile applications that will further add to our omni-channel customer experience and the overall digital ecosystem.</p><h4>Takaful Emarat aims to be the first takaful company in the world incorporating blockchain. What does this mean for the company?</h4><p>The number-one issue in the insurance industry is that customers do not trust their insurers to pay a claim and feel like it will be a hassle to get the claim paid out. Insurance companies also do not trust their customers because they are always wary of fraud. Blockchain will solve that. It creates authenticity and trust. Additionally, there will no longer be paper. We will get into smart contracts that will not be transferable, speak only to the specific client's needs, and do not require signatures. We no longer have to manually check records. Costs will be lower as well. That is why we want to be the first to roll it out.</p><h4>How will the digital revolution impact the takaful insurance business?</h4><p>Agents will be obsolete and chat bots and automated call center operations will become the new norm. We make it an attractive product and pull people in without using agents. That is really where the difference is. We need to sell with a combination of IT, big data, analytics, blockchain, and artificial intelligence. We are about to see huge changes in the industry. With the appointment of Fadi Hindi as Takaful Emarat's new CEO this year, we have set the stage for something special that will completely change the way people and businesses look at insurance. We also recently hired a Chief Digital Officer, a complete marketing department, and an IT team. We need data and IT specialists for the future, not financial experts. The final piece is R&amp;D. I always push people to think about innovation. We want to innovate and change the mindset. There is the saying; “Uber yourself before you get Kodaked." </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the focus of Gulf Business Consulting Group?</h4><p>In the last several years, we have been focused on any technology that can improve people's lives in different sectors such as education, healthcare, retail, hospital, and tourism. In the last two years, we were investing in companies in those sectors and helping them operate and invest in the UAE market. For example, one of our companies is collaborating in partnership with Emirates NBD Bank to create the digital branch of the future. We believe in digitalization and the government is pushing to convert all the sectors and industries from analog to digital, which is what we are working on and are a part of.</p><h4>How closely do you work with the government on its innovation agenda?</h4><p>We work with government institutions, especially with the Dubai Chamber, Dubai FDI, and Dubai Future Accelerators. We work with them to bring in foreign companies from different backgrounds with disruptive technologies that want to be part of the digital revolution that is taking place in the UAE currently. They are setting the pace and opening branches and offices in the UAE to be close to the government and the developments in this technological and digital revolution. The Internet of Things (IoT) and cybersecurity are crucial. We are in a strategic part of the world, and cybersecurity is therefore crucial. This is something that we are pushing for and helping investors to work on.</p><h4>How does your business model integrate international companies that want to enter the market with local companies and the government?</h4><p>We represent certain chambers of commerce and trade promotion offices. 60% of our work is with government entities from 12 countries mainly from Europe and Latin America. The other 40% involves working with companies from those countries that want to come to the UAE to do business. We work as a bridge and provide services such as market research, feasibility studies, and assistance with business strategy based on our experiences in the last 12 years. We help them understand the country's culture, the business culture, and the business etiquette in this part of the world.</p><h4>How can companies benefit from ease of doing business here?</h4><p>Dubai is the city of the future, with political stability, a legal framework, and security. Logistically, there is Jebel Ali Port and Emirates Airlines, with which one can connect to the majority of the world in less than seven or eight hours. Logistically, legally, financially, politically, and geographically, everything points to Dubai. The government supports and funds many projects, which means opportunities. The UAE backs talented people and innovative companies that want to bring disruptive technologies. The Dubai government is especially supportive of SMEs. Companies that do not have the financial muscle but still have amazing ideas can receive government support as a result of leaderhip in the UAE. The millennials who bring new technologies and fresh ideas need guidance, courage, support, and financing. The only disadvantage is that operational costs here are expensive. The government needs to facilitate that for all companies, give them financial tools, and open credit for them to make a smooth landing in the UAE market.</p><h4>Will you expand your operations in Dubai and the GCC?</h4><p>Our plan is to continue to grow and open more offices in the GCC; however, due to the political situation, we have put our plans on hold. Though, the future here is promising. We see a great deal of interest from foreign companies because of the vision of the local government. Dubai is ahead of many other countries, and all those companies that are passionate about technology and innovation in other countries want to come here. They are potential clients for us, and we believe the next three years in particular will be interesting. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What makes Nasdaq Dubai an attractive platform for companies that are looking to raise capital?</h4><p>One of the most important things for a company that wants to raise capital is to ensure that it chooses the right market. The geographical scale of a company's operations should be reflected in the access to investors that an exchange gives them. Nasdaq Dubai does so well because we can give unbiased and unrestricted access to both local investors and investors from around the world. We are experts in IPOs and listed companies, and issuers are experts in their own respective areas, so we combine our knowledge with their industry knowledge. We make sure that all the platforms that are available to us from a PR, marketing, and visibility point of view are at the issuer's disposal. With our new MarketSite that focuses on visibility and telling the story of the issuer, we will grow further.</p><h4>How do you assess your pipeline of equity and debt listings?</h4><p>In 2017, we saw 18 equity and debt listings, and in 1H2018, we had 12 listings with a total value of approximately USD10 billion on the exchange and we expect that there will be more listings by end-2018. The interest from new sectors to explore the capital market has been expanding, which is a good sign for us and other exchanges in the UAE because it indicates a maturing sector. In terms of the products that will be admitted to the exchange this year, we will be exceeding last year's performance.</p><h4>How do you expect the REIT market to evolve going forward?</h4><p>REITs are one of the products that will play a key role for years to come. Exchanges need to gear up for that level of activity. Today, we are proud to have two REITs listed with us and that number will grow over the coming years. REITs are a creative product that allow real estate owners and investors to come together in a transparent and regulated environment that protects all parties connected to it. Dubai has had a fast-growing real estate market for the past three to four decades, with assets that are purpose-built and functional. We will be one of the key REIT markets going forward. In 2017, we collaborated with Dubai Land Department to facilitate REIT listings and are working with other government-related entities as well to make sure we promote REIT listings and make life easier for REIT issuers in the market. We have seen strong demand and expect this to continue.</p><h4>What are your plans for the further expansion of Nasdaq Dubai's derivatives platform?</h4><p>The derivatives market is one of first major product introductions in the UAE. We had to make sure that, apart from the exchange, the brokers and a core group of investors were ready to understand and utilize the products. If we look at the first year and a half and compare it to other regional launch of derivatives, Turkey comes to mind. Running the numbers side by side in terms of performance, volume, and market activity during the launch phase, we have outperformed Turkey by 10 times. Our commitment in this market is long term; hence, our focus with the launch of the derivatives market is solid. We have launched two index futures this year, one based on DFM's main index and the other based on ADX's. We have also announced that we will launch futures on 12 leading Saudi Arabian companies listed on Tadawul in September 2018. In terms of the overall market, all the metrics point to a great growth story. We will announce more products later this year and are really excited about how the platform will perform. We are pleased with the numbers, though there is a great deal of work still to be done. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[sugar-on-top]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>At over 100 years old, what have been the group's main achievements?</h4><p>Grupo Calesa is the largest agribusiness in Panama; we are known principally as sugar producers. We sell sugar in the local retail market; Panamanians grew up using La Estrella sugar. We are also the largest rice producer in Panama; our rice is one of the top-two brands in the market. We produce animal feed for shrimp, horses, and pigs, and also have another company that sells agriculture products like fertilizers and insecticides. We are the largest shrimp producer in Panama and also have a company that exports frozen shrimp to Europe. We are an integrated conglomerate with about 3,500 employees. The company was already a modern company 50 years ago and ahead of its time in many senses.</p><h4>How is your revenue divided between sugar and rice, and which markets do you export to?</h4><p>Our revenues are about 35% sugar, 30% rice, and the remainder comes from other businesses. Around 80% of our sugar is sold locally and 20% is exported to the US. The rice is sold locally as Panama only produces 70% of the rice that it consumes; therefore, we import rice as well. Shrimp is sold mostly to Spain and Italy, though we also do business with China.</p><h4>Do you plan to diversify the products offered by Grupo Calesa?</h4><p>Our company was innovating vigorously much before the term became fashionable; innovation is in our DNA and is the hallmark of any company that, like in our case, remains in business for over a century. Over the last five years, as agriculture and technology rapidly converge, the pace of change has accelerated dramatically. We have embraced the concept of agribusiness as a high-tech industry as technology provides us with the means of addressing the limitations that we face in terms of scale and high labor costs. We have allocated resources accordingly, aiming to become a company at the forefront of high-tech agriculture.</p><h4>What are your goals and priorities for the coming year?</h4><p>Our vision is to become a world-class agribusiness conglomerate by 2021, with everything this implies in terms of product quality, brand strength, production costs, environmental practices, and so on. We want to be able to compete within the best-in-market niche and, thus, expand our markets. Our goals for 2018 are consistent with this vision: we are investing in people, technology, improved standards and certifications, and new product development. We still have much work to do, but we are firmly on our way. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has CEMEX evolved since setting up operations in the country?</h4><p>CEMEX has been in Panama for 24 years and is today the leading company and point of reference in the cement and construction business here. We have grown with the country. Panama experienced significative changes when it took over control of the Panama Canal in the year 2000. Importantly, in 2005 we expected the country to continue its growth path, and, therefore, CEMEX made an investment of USD300 million on our operations here. CEMEX is the only clinker producer in Panama, which is the main raw material for the cement industry in the country. We are very proud to participate as suppliers in some of the largest and most emblematic infrastructure projects in the history of the nation: the Panama Canal Expansion project, the Panama Subway Line 1, and three other large projects that will have a positive effect on the development of the country and the quality of life of its people: the Panama Subway Line 2, the City of Colón Urban Renewal, and the first liquified natural gas electric generation plant in Central America, which is being constructed in Colón.</p><h4>CEMEX is present in many countries in Latin America. How important is Panama to the company?</h4><p>Panama is one of the most important countries for CEMEX worldwide in terms of business, volume, growth, and geographical position. We have invested in various business lines in Panama. We are the only clinker producer and are in the cement, concrete, ready-mix, and aggregate fields. In 2017, we also started in the cement additive—admixtures—business. In the last 24 years, CEMEX has invested around USD600 million in the country.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on CEMEX's initiatives to be environmentally friendly in Panama?</h4><p>We have a sustainability committee that meets once a month and is responsible for developing and guaranteeing the effectiveness of our programs and initiatives. We have several sustainability initiatives in progress here in Panama. First, we are part of the Million Hectares Alliance and are making a major effort to reforest more than 50ha of woods in 10 years. In addition to being part of this initiative, we are working extremely hard with the government and other private companies to help create a cleaner city by contributing to overcoming challenges such as waste management. We have the know-how to process and recover energy through our kilns from alternative fuels in a responsible way, such as municipal solid waste, tires, and biomass residues. In addition, we are making changes in our ready-mix plants to reuse water in different parts of our processes. We are also taking steps to rehabilitate our quarries once we finish using them. CEMEX shares best practices across all the countries the company works in. These projects are part of CEMEX's global green initiatives to reduce our CO2 footprint by 25% in the next three years.</p><h4>What are the main challenges for the cement sector in Panama, and what needs to be changed in this market?</h4><p>Our biggest challenge is maintaining the growth we have had in the last 10 years. The economic model of the country is changing, and this is a challenge for both the government and the private sector. The way people used to build is also changing, and this will affect our industry. CEMEX has been preparing for the challenges ahead, and one key initiative is CEMEX Go, which is a best-in-class digital platform aimed at providing a superior customer experience. CEMEX Go is a multi-device offering that provides a seamless experience for order placement, live tracking of shipments, and managing invoices and payments for CEMEX's main products, including bagged and bulk cement, ready-mix concrete, aggregates, and multi-products. It delivers real-time, detailed information that customers need to get more done in less time, enabling them to have more control over their businesses and increase value to their stakeholders. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been the evolution of Powerchina in Panama since 2014, and what is the importance of Panama for the entire group?</h4><p>The initial contact of the group with Panama was in 2009, in the bid for the first expansion of the Panama Canal through its subsidiary Sinohydro. Following the restructuring of Powerchina's international businesses in 2016, six regional offices were established globally. Panama was chosen to be the headquarters to support the operations of the group in the Americas in August that year. A year later and as a result of the work of a multidisciplinary team formed by Panamanian, Chinese, and foreign professionals, Powerchina was awarded, in consortium with a local company, the water infrastructure project for the extension of the hydraulic ring to Panama East. This achievement underlines the commitment of Powerchina to Panama and its firm interest in contributing to the country's development process and supporting the execution of plans, programs, and strategic projects in the fields of energy, social development, and transport infrastructure.</p><h4>How strong is public sector support in Panama?</h4><p>Panama has a healthy economic environment and a lot of institutional support is given for the development of infrastructure projects. Proof of this is the strategic plan of the government, where the public investment programs in infrastructure sectors are one of the central pillars. Currently the overall budget for the construction industry is approximately USD4 billion, which represents an important public support and business opportunities for companies like us focused on the construction sector. Regarding the private investment programs, we are focused on the energy sector where we expect to qualify to participate in PPP and concessions for a hydroelectric plant and a transmission line.</p><h4>What are your main projects in the country and what others are in the pipeline?</h4><p>We are pursuing a number of projects in Panama in cooperation with local companies and foreign companies with a consolidated presence in LATAM. One of them is the Metro Line 3 in consortium with the Spanish construction company Acciona. This project is of greatest interest to us due to its scale and technical challenge and in which the synergy created by the partnership between a Spanish company and Powerchina makes us a strong and reliable proponent by offering quality, technology, the understanding of the socio-cultural environment and language, and great financial capacity. Others are energy-related projects involving transmission lines and a hydro power plant: the transmission line IV and Bocas del Toro hydro power plant. Due to the scale of both projects, our strategy will be as well to form alliances with foreign companies with a strong presence in LATAM. We are assessing other medium-sized projects in the field of the social development with the aim of expanding the scope of work and becoming an important player in the development of Panama.</p><h4>What are your projections for further China-Panama business in light of growing diplomatic relations?</h4><p>I am extremely confident that in the coming years this market will be active for Chinese companies. With the government-to-government finance framework agreement already signed, it is likely that funding from the Chinese government will come soon to promote infrastructure projects of major importance to Panama. This new context represents an excellent platform for trade and investment promotion. I have participated in a number of business forums held both in Panama and China, and there are great business opportunities here that will definitely attract the interest of investors from China. The first direct flight between Beijing and Panama City will undoubtedly promote tourism by Chinese citizens. The establishment of bilateral relations creates a scenario suitable for not only economic and trade cooperation but also social, cultural, and educational cooperation in pursuing joint development goals.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate the progress of the PCCP project?</h4><p>We have to take into account that this project was already structured under a previous owner. Since the buy-out by PCCP, we have been working in three areas: 40ha for the port and terminal; 54ha for the logistics park; and 24ha for the free trade zone (FTZ). The FTZ has already been established, and we are integrating these three areas to create an added-value chain and take advantage of the trading relationship between China and Panama. The total area of the project is around 169ha. We have completed the reclamation stage, which consists of approximately 250,000sqm. The third wharf with a capacity for vessels of 8,000-12,000 tons is currently under construction. In total, the port consists of three wharves; two are for Super/New Panamax vessels of over 18,000 tons. Moreover, there are 11 gantry cranes and 54ha for the logistics and cargo consolidation area. Along with transshipment, our goal for PCCP is to serve the whole American market. This objective is achievable because Landbridge, our parent company, is renowned globally. Through PCCP, we want to add value and are negotiating with various Chinese companies that are interested in using Panama as a hub for their operations. Our third wharf is planned to start operations by 2Q2019. We are pushing our schedule hard because the Chinese president's official visit to Panama is scheduled for December 2019; we are currently slightly ahead of schedule.</p><h4>What will it mean for the region to have PCCP able to accommodate the new type of Neo-Panamax vessels?</h4><p>The key differentiating factor in this industry is being able to offer greater productivity, and we are going to use all the latest, state-of-the-art Chinese technology for this project. For example, our provider for gantry cranes is ZMPC, which has captured 90% of the American market. We will also be using the latest RGTs, which are the smaller cranes, as well as the newest information systems. Being able to handle larger amounts of cargo is important because the current trend in shipping is focused on larger volumes.</p><h4>How much support is your project receiving from the Chinese and Panamanian governments?</h4><p>Initially, the support we received from the Panamanian state government was because Landbridge bought the project even before a relationship was established with the government. However, we have now benefited, for example, through the input of some qualified technical staff that know how to build a port and serve worldwide shipping markets. Contractually, we are allowed to have at least 800 direct employees in the construction phase of the project. Currently, we have around 190 Panamanian employees working in the company; overall 300 Panamanians have been employed for the port so far. Notably, Chinese history in Panama goes back 164 years, and both countries have played a key role in establishing commercial relations and activities.</p><h4>What is the main challenge that PCCCP faces?</h4><p>Cultural barriers have not been easy to overcome; however, it has been deeply inspiring to realize a project that unites two cultures that have been historically and demographically deeply rooted but distracted by unfounded prejudices that today are being mended as a result of the decision to reestablish diplomatic and, therefore, commercial and cultural ties.</p><h4>What are your goals and priorities at Panama Colón Container Port for the next year?</h4><p>We want to put our strategy into effect, which is integration. This means creating added value as well as having a clear strategy for the port as a terminal. Our goal is to join all these functions together and start developing the business. This is why we have chosen this location on Margarita Island; there is an international airport just half a mile from PCCP. At the same time, the port has quick access to the railway. This integration is what differentiates us from other ports. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>FJA is based in Madrid with an office in Panama. Why did it decide to open a branch in Panama?</h4><p>The evolution of FJA paralleled the needs of its clients in Europe, Latin America, and other geographical areas. Specifically, our linkage to the aeronautical sector greatly favored this international mobility. Our decision to permanently establish ourselves in Panama is linked to the need to centralize operations and businesses of our clients throughout the area in a location that provides adequate legal security and stability. Panama is the right place, where the two Americas connect, as an international financial center, a logistic hub, and soon as the digital hub for the Americas.</p><h4>In what fields does FJA have a competitive advantage over other law firms in Panama?</h4><p>We have extensive experience and capacity in diverse sectors, such as real estate, construction, hotel sector, tourism, and air navigation. We also have a special position in the field of new technologies, increasingly important in international transactions.</p><h4>What should foreign companies be aware of before entering Panama?</h4><p>Panama provides businesses with a safe environment that is familiar with economic activity, with increasing development in recent years. To enter a market, despite these indisputable advantages, it is necessary to have adequate legal advice through professionals who know both the legislation and the practice of business in the country, as well as its international connection. Our firm facilitates these services as well as a powerful network of international contacts and collaborators in different countries.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>Despite the different threats or global risks that surround the global economy, economic activity is currently moving in a positive direction, and we see growing opportunities related to traditional sectors, especially in the area of new technologies. These are both a tool that facilitates business, economic transactions, and the flow of information, and an economic sector that must be addressed and whose evolution is unstoppable. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Smartbytes has been leading the sector for 15 years. How was 2017 for the company?</h4><p>2017 was challenging because the economy slowed down, and many of our clients were not investing at the pace we expected. The entire IT industry in Panama was going through the same situation. Companies were holding back their IT investments. In order to reach our goals, we redefined our strategy to allocate more resources for cybersecurity. Despite the aforementioned economic situation, every company faces the need to protect itself from cyber-attacks. This shift in our strategy's roadmap yielded remarkable results and will be part of our core business from now on.</p><h4>Smartbytes has customers from various sectors and countries. What are your expansion plans?</h4><p>We are looking for opportunities in Central America, and we have been working in Peru and Chile as well. However, instead of entering these countries to compete, we want to enter and collaborate. Our plan is to settle down through strategic partnerships. In Costa Rica, Peru, and Chile, we have already identified companies that we want to collaborate with in order to maximize our efforts and speed up results. The trend is no longer competition but cooperation. Competition is fine; but when we collaborate, we achieve much more. This is already deployed. Our team is ready and focused.</p><h4>How has the company's rebranding process, which it initiated in 2017, progressing?</h4><p>It started in 2014 as we wanted to give our brand a story that could resonate with our audience. That is how our current brand colors and logo were born. It was highly praised by our clients and business partners. We teamed up with Muchagana, a brilliant creative agency, and when it was finished we took it a little further and completely changed our company culture. Work-life integration is fundamental for us now, including allowing people to disconnect and enjoy their families.</p><h4>What is your business focus for the coming years?</h4><p>Smartbytes thrives on innovation. Cybersecurity, MSP, data management, mobile app development, and cloud computing are five areas where we predict a promising future, therefore, focusing our efforts. These are all part of the internet of things. Any company who fails to embrace digital transformation will perish. Our job is to help them regardless of their size or business activity. A few years ago, we were the first company in Panama to offer hardware as a service, also known as HaaS. It was a breakthrough. Now, four years later the entire industry is adopting these models.</p><h4>Smartbytes has the most Gold Microsoft competencies in the country and is the most awarded company from HPE due to its quality and innovation. What does this mean for Smartbytes?</h4><p>It means everything for us. Working with brands such as HPE, F5, Manage Engine, Fortinet, Dell, or Microsoft requires a great deal of expertise, and the only way to demonstrate that is through nonstop education and certifications. Without the highest certifications and skill level, we do not have the knowledge required to represent them. It means we cannot truly assure our clients that we are fit to provide the right solutions for them. Having the highest certifications titles in HPE and Microsoft means a great deal to us.</p><h4>What are your goals, ambitions, and priorities for 2018?</h4><p>Our main priority will never change. These are our employees and clients. It has been like that since day one. As far as goals for 2018, we will increase our MSP sales and our portfolio of cybersecurity solutions and will keep investing heavily in our employees' education. Additionally, we recently signed a partnership agreement with Dell that will strengthen our presence in the SME market, adding tons of value to our clients. Dell EMC is our latest business partnership and will allow us to offer a more diversified portfolio of cloud computing and virtualization options. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How was 2017 for Tecnasa?</h4><p>It was a challenging year for the country and its socio-economic status in the region. Tecnasa is a company that has been able to diversify its risks by expanding geographically. So, for us whenever one country in the region might be facing economic difficulties, we have other geographic locations that are able to grow and compensate for this. We are a company that has consistently been growing throughout these 45 years. Our market share depends on the service and solutions we provide. One of our most important solutions throughout the region are the financial solutions and ATMs we provide, especially in Panama where we have over 80% of the market. We also have over 2,000 clients in the region that are the most important companies in each of their industries. We are a B2B company focused on mid-to-large-sized enterprises. </p><h4>Are you looking to expand into new markets? </h4><p>Our vision has always been to become a regional leader in IT solution integrations. In 2017, we looked back and saw that we had become the IT solutions leader in Central America and Ecuador. After more than two years of planning, we launched our new strategy in 2017, which is focused very much on managed services. It is not a strategy based on geographic expansion but on improving the quality of our services and transforming our portfolio from hardware sales to service solution implementation. Our strategy is also based on becoming consultants for our clients and helping them understand the new disruptive technologies present in the market and how it can help them improve their business operations. </p><h4>Are IT companies getting more into services instead of hardware?</h4><p>It is no longer a trend, but a fact—and not only for services focused on repairing the technology, but the entire solution for a monthly fee. Then, it is up to us as their technology partner to make sure these solutions are available 100% of the time.  </p><h4>How is Tecnasa University progressing?</h4><p>We are launching it with 13 online courses focused on customer services. These are courses that every new recruit for the company has to take when they join so they can understand our new vision and mission and see how we are becoming a management services and consultancy company. </p><h4>Tecnasa has received multiple awards recently. What do these mean for the company?</h4><p>It is a result of our hard work and a benchmark for how Tecnasa compares to others in the region. We strive to be the best at everything we do, and that includes our partnerships with the most important IT leaders in the world. So it is a good signal that we are on the right track. </p><h4>What do you want to achieve for Panama and the region? </h4><p>We have a five-year strategy we want to incorporate into the entire region: deliver the best integrated technology to everyone in the region. Therefore, our challenge is being able to evolve and grow our human talent on par with what companies and clients expect from us. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What strategy did you employ to increase the number of Movistar users, and what does Panama represent for Movistar's global operations?</h4><p>In Panama, we opted for a company plan focused on the development of a company culture covering simplicity, portfolio, differentiation, and a consistent strategy. We have built a great value proposal based on user experience and our role as leaders in the digital experience of our customers. Our clients' preferences are not just about one moment, but about consistency over time. This consistency has allowed us to be the leaders in service experience by innovating through service channels like WhatsApp or our mobile application with Movistar Play. This allows customers in Panama to be 70% digital. As a result, we have had more than 130,000 monthly conversations through WhatsApp and are able to securely analyze our clients' demands and give immediate feedback. This is linked to the efforts we have made to strengthen our network. We have high traffic in the LTE and 4G networks and are working on not only expanding into new coverage areas but also strengthening our network. This allows us to provide greater capacity and respond to the demands of our customers who are inclined to consume video content.</p><h4>You plan to invest USD25 million in Panama. What will you focus on with this investment?</h4><p>We have invested more than USD600 million in the country over the last 10 years alone. We are on track to increase the capacity of the network, bringing new 3G coverage areas to LTE. We already have a Universal Service Fund project with AIG that gives access to communities without connectivity and are launching a second project to cover the areas near San Blas.</p><h4>What strategy is Telefónica Movistar following to reach the SME segment with products such as Smart Business?</h4><p>Since our headquarters are in Guatemala, we service five countries in Central America, though our main market is Panama, where the main multinational companies are present. We offer a program called “Movistar sin Fronteras" that allows our clients to make phone calls without having to pay extra roaming fees in Central America. And we are leaders in converting the B2B business into three aspects: cybersecurity; big data, a theme on which we held a forum in 2018 and also is a core factor for our business as SMEs and big companies require more consulting services to help them adapt to future trends; and third, a reconversion of our sales force into a more consultative and digital transformation task, something that we have applied to ourselves and are now extrapolating to the level of big data and digital ratings. </p><h4>What else have you done to improve your customer services?</h4><p>We are working hard to keep our employees motivated. Teams are transformed when there is a great deal of transparency. That is a key factor to motivate our workers, and we place great focus on training. Nearly 70% of our training services are digital, and many of them are online courses, so we use on-demand digital platforms to train our employees. Besides, it is important to analyze every interaction with our customers to understand the changes they want us to implement. </p><h4>What are your main targets for the coming year?</h4><p>Our main goal is to continue strengthening our relationship with our customers. We will improve the network and also launch new services at the end of the year such as VoLTE. In January 2019, we will support World Youth Day, which is a technological challenge for telecommunication companies like ours. In terms of services, we want to proactively advance in the areas where clients demand more services, instead of waiting for them to warn us that something is not working well. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Samsung evolved in Panama, and what were some of the highlights from 2017?</h4><p>Samsung Panama is a regional hub for 23 countries in Central and South America, as well as the Caribbean. 2017 was an excellent year for us, especially in mobile phones. The IT sector in general today includes the sale of LEDs and many other products that are growing. In this market, we face uncertainty in the form of political issues with the upcoming elections. However, the economy is growing across the region, with significant growth in Guatemala and the Dominican Republic, in addition to Panama. In terms of total turnover, we are under the Latin America headquarters and have subsidiaries in many countries. Panama is number three overall after Brazil and Mexico, followed by Chile, Argentina, Colombia, and Peru. Panama is a small market, though we oversee several territories from here. Panama is a great place to manage our operations as a result of the great logistics and strategic advantages as a center. We have a large warehouse in Colón that serves as a distribution center for many countries, including Cuba. Moving forward, we see competition increasing in 2018 and becoming tougher. Many companies are changing rapidly, and we compete in many markets with them. However, we are proud of our quality product and have great brand value with high technology. We are doing many activities to contribute to society and support our customers.</p><h4>How would you characterize Samsung's B2B activity in Panama? Does it have a successful corporate segment?</h4><p>Panama is a great place to do B2B activity. Many huge companies are based here, with Procter &amp; Gamble and Adidas close to our office, for example. We operate in an aligned way, to the extent that we have even opened a website for their employees. We cooperate with HR departments in different companies here to offer products to their employees through the site. They can log in, click, and buy our products through exclusive channels. Everything is online now, including business. We also tap into that.</p><h4>What new products are you set to launch in Panama?</h4><p>For Samsung, the products we launch typically comprise two new mobile phones every year. In 2018, we launched S9 and S9+. We plan to launch the Galaxy Note 9 in the second half of 2018 as well. The plus edition is being showcased at various B2B centers, and we invite customers to come and take a look there. We not only showcase mobile phones during these shows, but also products like LEDs, phone cases, and security products, especially for B2B. Through our products, companies can block certain types of mail or set up separate systems. When we work together with a company, we always introduce this side of our products together with whatever it is buying.</p><h4>What particularities of Panamanian customers have you noticed?</h4><p>They are critical; they are not simply looking for high quality or expensive products but are checking the function of each against the price. Aside from the high-end market, people generally compare prices in great detail. We cannot sit back and relax for even a moment, because if another company offers a product with better specifications at a better price, consumers will switch brands nearly immediately. We are working to become better at all times.</p><h4>What have you identified as the main challenge of doing business in Panama?</h4><p>There are several aspects. Most of the companies here manage many countries from Panama as a central hub. The population here is 4 million, though the population of the region is 130 million, making the market extremely large. Panama is stable, though there are certain uncertainties here generated by political activity. Size-wise, it is small, and the channels are also small. We have smaller dealers, and it is hard to standardize our business. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[solid-to-the-core]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>With over 30 years of operations in Panama, how did the company perform in 2017?</h4><p>In general, 2017 was a great year for the industry and Tetra Pak. Compared to previous years, there was a decline in the growth rate. Several years ago, we were seeing double-digit growth, but growth in 2017 was in single digits. If we compare Panama to the rest of the region, though, we are still performing well. The only other country performing as well is the Dominican Republic. We are placing a greater focus on services. There has been a great deal of consolidation in the market, and this is putting pressure on people to reduce operational costs. This has forced companies to look for alternatives to improve operations, and one such way is through services. We have a consulting team for the industry, and this is where we have seen the most revenue growth. We focus a great deal of our resources on services, and our service business, lead by consulting, has grown by double digits.</p><h4>In 2016, Tetra Pak launched a spare parts service center hub. How is it progressing?</h4><p>Panama was one of the first markets in which we started operating. It was not the largest market; therefore, it was a good pilot. Now, we have expanded across the entire Americas and are managing the spare parts industry for the entire region from Panama. We also moved our purchasing operations to Panama.</p><h4>Who are your main clients in Panama?</h4><p>In Panama, our main customers are Nevada, Bonlac, and Estrella Azul. All these companies seek to capture market share and place great focus on reducing operational costs. This is how we can contribute, with our services and consulting teams helping companies reduce costs. In the past, we only offered these services to our direct customers; now, however, we offer them to the entire food industry. </p><h4>Tetra Pak is recognized as one of the most attractive companies to work for in the region. How do you attract and retain the best human talent?</h4><p>The company's number one component is its strong core values, by which we always try to live. One of these values is fun, which is rarely enumerated as a core company value. We work to make sure our people are happy. We offer our employees the option of working from home, which is not that common in Panama. We also encourage them time to be active and engage in sports. We have team and family activities and work to ensure we are a family rather than just colleagues. Another key component that makes a difference is our long-term vision. We are a private company, and we focus a great deal on long-term results. Quality in innovation is also extremely important; we are always working to provide new packages, services, and products to maximize our position within the food industry. The human talent in Panama is excellent, which is part of the reason why we focus our operations in this area. It is extremely easy to find top-quality people. </p><h4>Can you elaborate on your sustainability initiatives?</h4><p>As we continue our journey, our ambition is to have a 100% renewable package. Right now, our packaging is 100% recyclable, though the idea is to have one that is both. In 2018, we will commemorate the 10th anniversary of “Tu Papel Cuenta" campaign in Panama, which aims to create awareness among local consumers to recycle their packages and other materials. We have already ensured that the paper in our packaging comes from renewable, well-managed forests. Now, the plastic in our cap also comes from a renewable source. We also put the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) logo on all our packages to let consumers know the materials used in this packaging comes from well-managed forests and other controlled sources. This is extremely important in countries such as Costa Rica, where there is a strong focus on the environment. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[where-speed-matters]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the evolution of the company on the eve of its 75th anniversary? </h4><p>The company started as a small business in the city center run by my grandfather and uncle. Back then, bikes were used to make deliveries due to the city's small size. The idea of establishing Max E. Jiménez sprouted on the back of my grandfather's work experience at Haseth, an older company. The company went through an extended period of growth after our office was moved next to Radio Mia facilities. Later, the offices were moved to the present location, from which the company has been operating for around 50 years. The area around the current office premises used to be on the outskirts; even the street in front of the office did not exist before. </p><h4>What have been some of the company's main achievements over the years? </h4><p>Over the years, the company has been involved in a number of different projects. At one time, it used to represent Agfa Color. While the lab was downstairs, the photo development process was carried out upstairs. The company also enjoyed healthy success in the pharmaceutical business. For example, we maintained a partnership with a German pharmaceutical company with 50% capital. We also used to manage the distribution of medicines in the Panamanian market before the partnership ended in the 1970s. Since the distribution industry in Panama is small, we work with nearly every sector in the industry. Through calculated efforts we have gained strength in the food industry, especially via our agreement with Nestlé. We experienced great business from 2006-2013. This is partly because in recent years, we have focused immensely on distributing chemicals and raw materials.</p><h4>From which markets do you import raw materials?</h4><p>A major chunk is imported from China, with the remaining raw materials delivered from the US, Europe, or other Asian countries such as India. We are aware of the changing times and the rise in the use of technology. Therefore, in order to revamp the company, we are currently designing a new website that will allow clients to view technical specifications before placing online orders. Additionally, we are planning to integrate live chat in the website for greater customer service. </p><h4>What sets apart Max E. Jimenez from its competitors?</h4><p>The prime differentiating factor is the availability of products in our inventory. At any given time, the company's inventory has almost USD2-million worth of products ready to be dispatched. Clients who prefer to buy directly from the supplier due to high volumes often struggle with delays. We are confident that the launch of our website will drive our competitive edge even further. Moreover, we are renowned for our service provision and fast delivery speeds; Max E. Jiménez always receives excellent results in Nestlé's yearly audits. </p><h4>After working in the distribution sector for decades, what are the identified challenges?</h4><p>At present, one of the main problems that we are dealing with is the required documentation for imports. Regulatory authorities, such as AUPSA, have different customs controls. These authorities got stricter after the incident related to diethylene glycol lead to several deaths. As a result, products like glycerin must be tested in a lab to ensure they do not contain diethylene glycol—a process that can take up to a month.</p><h4>How do you want to diversify?</h4><p>One potential option is to penetrate new markets in Central America. The issue in Panama is that every new company that enters the market starts with cheaper prices, forcing us to buy in bulk and build large inventories. In order to tackle that, we promise our clients to match or beat any price that is being offered in the market.</p><h4>What is your main goal for 2018?</h4><p>We want to push out of the recession through expansion and alternative growth methods. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have Pintuco's operations evolved since being acquired by Grupo Kativo in 2012?</h4><p><span></span>Our main task has been the positioning of the brand. In 2012, Pintuco was a new brand in Panama and not well known. The brand got its start 12 years ago, when El Machetazo and Cochez distributed its paint, though its name was not as recognized as other brands in Panama. However, its evolution was well timed because Pintuco was installed in the factory where Panamanian paint had been manufactured for over 40 years, so its presence was deeply rooted in Panama. Painting is synonymous with happiness, change, and joy. We connect with Panamanians through those feelings and the paint factory, which is the only one in the country that is independent of foreign capital. The relationship with employees was crucial, and that was also one of the significant achievements of the company and the management group. We were able to connect the factory with the commercial environment and explained to people involved in marketing and production that there would be a sustained change with a leading company in the South American market. There was a change of brand, though it was the same factory, and we kept the same workers. Pintuco is a multi-Latin company with over 70 years in the Andean market. The group has six Central American companies, led by Panama and Costa Rica, and the brand is well known in Colombia, Venezuela, and Ecuador. </p><h4>What is the importance of Panama for the group in general?</h4><p>Panama is the most important country in Central America. Although it has the smallest population in the region, it has a tremendous cultural vocation to paint. Panamanians paint a great deal at the end of the year because they relate it to renewal and joy, so during that season sales are overflowing. On the other hand, Panama combines many trade motor centers where the decorative aspect is relevant. Panama has a large maritime profile, not only because of the Panama Canal but also because of its ports. It also has trains, road infrastructure, the tallest buildings in Central America, commercial centers, and other areas that require large amount of paint that is suitable for decoration at any level, and our products are durable, washable, and anti-fungal.</p><h4>2017 was a challenging year in many aspects. How many gallons did Pintuco Panama produce?</h4><p>Approximately 30% of the paint market in Panama moves through Pintuco; of that, 80% of the market is decorative and construction, while the remaining 20% is industrial maintenance, automotive industry, wood and roads, and marine.</p><h4>What is your competitive value compared to other competitors?</h4><p>Our competitive value is the factory, people, and long-term relationships we have had with commercial actors. There are factory and production guidelines and a commercial guideline for public relations and negotiations. Also, our portfolio of products covers all segments of the market and allows us to reach competitive prices and quality. We have a robust portfolio.</p><h4>Where do you see Pintuco in five years?</h4><p>We expect to be significantly better positioned. We have already gone through the uncertainty stage of managing a brand that is deeply rooted in Panama and bringing a new brand. We expect to recover our leadership position in a competitive market. Pintuco has a vision to adapt to the changes because Panama is constantly evolving. Five years ago, we did not have a subway, but soon we will have a rail system that will connect Panama with all its provinces. Pintuco will play its part as each work needs maintenance.</p><h4>What is your main objective for 2018?</h4><p>We want to strengthen the factory through the maintenance of our water treatment plant, industrial safety equipment, and infrastructure renovation. We also want to invest in the factory and in our people with courses and seminars. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did the company evolve in Panama, and what is the importance of its market to the group?</h4><p>Sagicor Panama was established in 1999 and offers life, health, and accidental death business lines. We also manage pension plans for retirement and disability income. Sagicor is an international company that started in 1840 in Barbados, and in October 2018 we will celebrate our 20th anniversary in Panama. Here, the company is focused on the middle market; our biggest selling products are individual and group health. We sell term life and group life products and are looking to have a new universal life product by mid-2018. This is a permanent product, giving savings and protection all the way up to age 120 of the person insured. As long as you pay your premiums, you have coverage and savings. Panama is an important market for the company because the country has political stability, uses the US dollar, and has an advantageous geographical position. Sagicor is present throughout the US and is the leader in the Caribbean. In Panama, we are still a small company compared to local ones, but we are investing a lot to develop a strong technological platform to give excellent service to our clients.</p><h4>How important is the multinational and business segment to Sagicor?</h4><p>The corporate segment is important, but we are not only focused on that niche because in Panama there are only about 270,000 individual life policies out of four million people. Considering that many people have more than one individual life policy, this means that not even 270,000 people have bought insurance policies. This makes Panama a great market to sell individual life insurance policies.</p><h4>How is Sagicor working to increase insurance awareness in Panama?</h4><p>We are changing our web page and making some structural changes and giving it a face-lift, as it has been the same for the last six years. There is great potential to sell more personal life insurance products given there are more than 3.8 million Panamanians without coverage. People never think about buying life insurance because they feel they are alive and healthy and do not think they need it. But they do understand the need for health insurance once they are married. For example, a complicated birth could cost tens of thousands of dollars. In the Panamanian insurance market, automobile coverage is number one, since it is mandatory, followed by health and life. </p><h4>What are the main challenges for the insurance market in Panama?</h4><p>Opening new distribution channels and penetrating the mass market are the two main challenges. Every year less people are interested in selling insurance. Some 10 or 20 years ago you could have people without a diploma selling insurance for you, but now the law requires that they hold a diploma or professional insurance qualification to act as an insurance adviser. Nowadays, not many people are interested in doing this; the youth hardly values a job that has this kind of uncertainty but that may exceed the gratification of a fixed salary. It is often older people who have no other option of finding a good job who end up doing this work. Most young people prefer a regular salary to the uncertainty of working on commission.</p><h4>What are Sagicor's main goals for 2018?</h4><p>Our first goal is to improve our products and services, using better software and information systems before launching our full universal life product in Panama. Once we have that in place, we are going to use all the backup services and software from Sagicor in the US to provide a better service to our insurance advisers and clients. It is a competitive product compared to what is currently available in the Panamanian market, and these products are already making a lot of sales for Sagicor in the US. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[finding-your-inner-shangri-la]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did the company perform in 2017 and the start of 2018?</h4><p>If we were to compare 2017 results with the previous year, we would have to admit that 2017 was not as good, at least in part because 2016 was an excellent year—our best in a decade. The conditions of 2016 were unique, while the activity in the last quarter of 2017 saw a notable slow down. We are not optimistic for this years' real estate market outcome, particularly at the high end, which in 2016 experienced strong and sustained demand. The short-term outlook does not look enticing either, since the coming year is a general election year, which negatively impacts economic activity. </p><h4>Why is Panamericana de Avalúos the only company whose reports are accepted by all banks?</h4><p>Our objectivity, sense of responsibility, professionalism, respect, integrity, credibility, and long-term commitment to our clients and the market we serve are important factors that have enabled us to enjoy and maintain a special relationship with the banking community. After almost 36 years of continuously serving the market, we have been very fortunate, and we are proud of the fact that we have earned a special place in Panama's corporate community. We always meet our delvery times.<br></p><h4>What clients do you target?</h4><p>There is an old saying in Spanish that translates into something like “every house is one man's castle." For us, the same goes with our clients—no matter how big or small. We serve every client with the same enthusiasm and professionalism. We also serve government agencies, though not on a regular basis. Considering the nature of the services we offer, we participate regularly in mergers and acquisitions, where discretion is not only expected but mandatory. </p><h4>Is the appraisals market well covered in Panama, and do you plan to expand into other markets? </h4><p>The market is well covered. Nevertheless, there is a constant flow of newcomers venturing into the market, hoping to get a piece of the pie. This creates a lot of pressure, urging you to stay at the top of your game. As a consequence of the existing conditions, we are constantly looking for new strategies as well as implementing new procedures in order to keep us at the forefront of the market. We are determined to maintain the place we have earned in the market and not to miss any opportunities. </p><h4>Can you elaborate on the company's CSR initiatives?</h4><p>We are conscious of what we have achieved and extremely grateful for what, with the help of God, family, and partners, we have been able to accomplish. Therefore, we strongly believe that the least we can do in return is to provide help and assistance to the community, especially to those less fortunate. As a corporation we are strongly involved in several social programs such as Casa Esperanza, an NGO working to keep young boys and girls off the streets while providing them with education and special skills so they can support themselves in the near future. We also contribute to Panama's Special Olympics chapter and several other NGOs working with youth. Once a year over the past 20 years, we also choose a school located in rural areas on the outskirts of the city to celebrate Christmas with children, teachers, and parents. </p><h4>What is your main goal and priority for the year ahead?</h4><p>The outlook for the next 12 months does not look very promising because it is a political year and, historically, economic activity during this period slows down. Constituents seem tired and upset with our political leaders, and many believe it will be a tough political campaign. The China factor will also be an important piece, though our relationship is unlikely to be the Shangri-La many believe it will be. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>APC Intelidat celebrated its 60th anniversary in 2017. How was the year for your operations?</h4><p>2017 was the best year to date for the company, as we recorded 31% YoY growth and was the first year we surpassed the USD2-million mark in terms of gross margin. We also did two major projects under the new branding of the company, APC Intelidat. This name gives us the opportunity to expand our business on credit as well as other information that could be interesting for people. We also formed a partnership with Thomson Reuters for compliance solutions in terms of blacklist verification and other services. The second major project was the launch of our consumer product for Android and iPhone applications, as well as a website. This is a subscription that gives users their complete credit record history and score. It notifies subscribers when a company inquires into their information. It is a new service, with already more than 15,000 subscribers. We are extremely pleased with the current figures and expect them to continue to grow. We intend to add more products to the platform.</p><h4>APC Intelidat has a wide portfolio of services. What is the core of your business?</h4><p>We have two major markets. One is corporate, which includes banks, finance corporations, and commerce in general. These companies use our services as part of their decision-making processes related to credit and finance applications. This allows companies to take the necessary precautions for clients that might default. We also have information regarding the market. We sell information to companies regarding credit in the market. Corporate is our major market. We also have the consumer market, for which we have the application as well as training. We train any individual in the country for free under our Social Responsibility Program: “Finance Under Control." We have already trained over 100,000 people. We provide advice on how to create a home budget, manage credit cards, and so on. We provide many tips and answer a great deal of questions. We have other social responsibility programs as well, for example for women at risk, senior citizens, children, and more.</p><h4>How do you keep your data safe from attacks or leaks?</h4><p>We have over 1,000 corporate customers and over 3 million Panamanians and residents in the system, which is mainly the whole economically active population. A data breach could happen to anyone. However, if we take the necessary security measures in order to avoid breaches, such as implementing a comprehensive cybersecurity methodology, then our system will be better protected. In our case, we decided to implement the Information Security Management Maturity Model and are preparing the company to get the ISO 27001 certification soon. We value the information we have, which is why we invested more than USD3 million in the last 16 months to improve the security of our data centers and have state-of-the-art technology. This is significant for a company with USD2 million in annual profits. We invest a great deal of our revenues in hardware, infrastructure, and staffing brilliant engineers whose chief goal is to keep our data available and protected. In addition to securing this information, it is important that we control access to the system. No one person has access to the entire system.  </p><h4>What would you like to accomplish in the year ahead?</h4><p>It is key to define our strategic partners. APC Intelidat and our customers need more products. Whether this is done ourselves or through a partner is a decision that has to be made as soon as possible. We will likely achieve this in the calendar year, not the fiscal one. The second priority is to identify other business opportunities. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Despite traded volumes seeing a 27.8% YoY decrease to USD5.3 billion in 2017, how would you asses the year?</h4><p>2017 traded volumes were similar to non-extraordinary years, 1.46% more than 2015. 28 new corporate securities were issued for over USD3.2 billion, 55.4% of which were on our primary market, 13.5% on our secondary market, and the remainder on our repurchase market. 2016 was an extraordinary year for the exchange, as we had important government-issued securities throughout the Government Market Makers Program, an asset liability management program conducted by the government that increased the volumes on these securities as well. We also had important activity on the corporate side, with new issues over USD500 million. Therefore, 2017 was a good year in terms of volume and new issuers coming into the capital markets. </p><h4>Can you elaborate on the highlights of the integration of the Panama and El Salvador exchanges?</h4><p>The integration has exceeded our expectations. We started with our first trading transaction in May, and by the close of the year trading volume was slightly over USD17 million. By early 2018, we had transactions on both markets for a total of USD51 million, with four remote operators from El Salvador and three from Panama. As growing expectations of the integration between our countries grow, we have received interest from other exchanges to join. In December 2016, the exchanges from El Salvador, Panama, and Nicaragua signed an MoU and have started meetings with our regulators. We have also been in conversation with other exchanges from the region, but have not yet signed MoUs. Interest has also been received from an exchange in South America, with whom we have already had our first meeting. </p><h4>What are you main goals and focuses for this year?</h4><p>One of the major initiatives we are working on this year is replacing our existing trading platform to NASDAQ's market technology. It is an important investment for us and key to our strategy for becoming the hub of the capital markets of the region. We are also focusing on regional market integration and plan to work on starting the integration process with one or two other markets by the end of this year. One of the major goals we have been working on for the past four years is our i-Link with Euroclear, which has three phases: the first is for government-issued securities that we have had since April 2014, the second is for corporate debt securities, and the third is for equities and mutual funds. The second and third phases have not yet been launched, and we are focusing on working along with the government and Euroclear to be able to have the second phase available by the end of 2018 or beginning of 2019. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How was 2017 for Scotiabank?</h4><p>2017 was a great year; it was part of our integration year which started from 2016, during which we recorded double-digit growth. We are a bank with a long-term focus, and this aligns with our operations in Panama because we believe in the country and the opportunities it has on offer. Historically, we have been a corporate commercial bank, which is how we started in 1974. We have undergone multiple changes over the years and have now become a fully universal bank with a complete retail offer. We had an excellent 2017 in retail, particularly in basic mortgages and auto products, and the composition of our balance sheet is changing; it was 70% corporate commercial and 30% retail 10 years ago, it is now more balanced around 55/45, and we are growing nicely in retail ahead of some competitors. Moving forward we are planning to improve that ratio even further. In 2017, credit cards were a major part of the story; we had a full year to manage the credit card portfolio we acquired from Citibank, and we have had great success doing that.</p><h4>Since June 4, Scotiabank Panama and Scotiabank Transformandose have maintained a single operation in the country. What are the main highlights of the process?</h4><p>It has been a success, and we are pleased with the results. It was a huge task system wise, and as a result, we are now one bank on a new technology platform. We now operate under the Scotiabank brand with a commitment to become our customer's primary bank by providing practical advice and relevant solutions. We have 21 branches for a country the size of Panama; therefore, we are extremely pleased with this coverage. In total, we have 130,000 clients for the new platform.</p><h4>Can you tell us about your corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives?</h4><p>CSR is an integral part of how Scotiabank conducts business across every country where it has presence. We are part of a community and try to be there for our clients while being responsive to the local needs to make a positive and meaningful difference. We are a global bank but are here to serve Panamanians.</p><h4>What is your strategy to remain competitive in such a competitive market?</h4><p>We are competitive by nature and through what we have done and achieved from a retail perspective. We believe in Panama, a country that has immense growth potential, and as a large financial center, there are opportunities for consolidation in the system. We will carefully look at opportunities as they come. Our biggest competitive advantage is that people recognize our global brand, and therefore, they want to be a part of it. Our natural cost of funds, thus, tends to be cheaper just because we are who we are: an extremely solid bank, a reputation that we have established and proven throughout the years. Our aim is to continue efforts to spread the brand more than it has been spread in the past. This is clear by our recent acquisition, which is a combination of our brand investing and installing digital platforms in the market through an aggressive strategy. We are truly investing as a bank to change to a digital perspective, and we expect people to use digital channels to access our products as opposed to queuing up in branches. We are investing money in this initiative across our global operations, and we are committed to further invest in our digitalization process.<br></p><h4>What are your goals and priorities for 2018?</h4><p><span></span>Now that we are integrated with more products and a stronger brand, we will focus on increasing the number of primary customers. We want more clients who consider Scotiabank as their sole bank of choice, to the point that the first thing they see in their wallet is a Scotiabank card. The key to achieve that is through a strong investment strategy, as well as a strategy for digital platforms. That is our biggest goal not just for 2018 but all the way to 2020. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[45 years of Impresa]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[francisco-pedro-balsemao-ceo-grupo-impresa]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the evolution of Grupo Impresa? What have been the main milestones and challenges over the years?</h4><p>There is Grupo Impresa and SIC, which is the most relevant part of Impresa right now because the TV business is thriving in Portugal. Impresa as a holding was launched 45 years ago in January 1973. It started as a newspaper, Expresso, that began during the Portuguese dictatorship. At the time, it was a huge risk to use free speech and there was a lot of censorship. Fortunately, a year later, Portugal became a democracy. In the 1980s, we were able to buy some magazines and became a publishing company by the 1990s. SIC was launched in 1992 and became the pioneer in its industry. Although it wasn't launched as a startup due to its expensive and large launch, it was a pioneering operation as the first privately held TV station in Portugal; We had to be disruptive in terms of the way we operated and due to our efforts, the channel quickly became the leader in the market in terms of ratings and shares within four years. Although we lost our leading status after maintaining it for five to six more years, we are still leaders regarding commercial targets: the most affluent families turn to our channel, which is extremely important because they have purchasing power that advertisers want to tap in to. Due to programming opportunities and choices, we have managed to create this strategy.  For example, telenovelas used to have the connotation of a low-quality product. However, in SIC's case, we have strong script writers backed with talented actors and these shows are viewed by millions of people from different backgrounds and locations. In terms of production, we don't have our own production company, but we work closely with a company called SP; SIC makes up 80-90% of their revenue; hence, we have a strong relationship. The telenovelas are a product of our cooperation. Notably, we won an Emmy in 2011, and in 2018 we won awards in France and Canada, allowing us to market our products abroad. So far, we have sold Portuguese soap operas in 43 countries, including South Korea, Italy, Mexico, Dubai, and Germany. We are renowned to be the first Portuguese channel to start cable operations and it paid off because of our high viewership among distribution platforms. We have SIC Notí­cias (News), the first 24-hour news channel in the country, which is number one among news channels. We have SIC Mulher (Women), SIC Caras (Celebrities) and SIC Radical for different target markets, as well as SIC Kids. We also export these channels abroad to 14 different countries, some of which speak Portuguese like in Mozambique and Angola, or have a diaspora of Portuguese communities, like in France and Canada. And we produce a channel only for the African market, DSTV Kids. We also have SIC Internacional and SIC Internacional África so SIC is the Portuguese media company that has the biggest number of channels in its portfolio (we produce and broadcast 9 channels).</p><h4>What strategy do you have to refocus the business on audiovisual and digital segments?</h4><p>We had a large publishing business up until end-2017. When I became CEO in March 2016, the strategic plan in place was ending; therefore, I decided to hire a consultant to help us develop a new plan. One thing we had always felt was that the publishing business in particular, in Europe, the US, and Australia, is  difficult. We had 14 publishing titles, and we decided to sell all of them except our original newspaper, Expresso, and a music magazine. We decided not to sell it because we wanted to capture the younger target market; however, we stopped printing it and converted it to an entirely digital publication. It was hard to sell off our titles because it meant losing 200 people and 12 products; however, we had to do it because the contribution of all these brands combined was insignificant to our EBITDA. Expresso is an oasis here in the publishing business; it has a 36% share of the advertising market in Portugal. Expresso has the largest circulation in Portugal, although print sales are falling. We will not be closing the paper version, although our growth is focused on the digital version. We are well ahead of the rest of the market, selling 25,000 digital copies of the newspaper every week. All in all, we sell 86,000 Expresso's weekly publications.</p><h4>Impresa closed 1H2018 with EUR2.5 million, 30 times higher than figures in 1H2017. To what would you attribute that success?</h4><p>It has been one year and nine months since the 2017-2019 strategic plan was put into place, and so far, it has produced tremendous results. Selling the publications was very important, reducing our fixed costs. Similarly, we had some programming cuts due to shows that were not getting a good return on investment. We had no opportunity to increase the return because many of them were foreign programs, such as Brazilian telenovelas. They were successful in the past in our programming slots, but consumers habits have evolved since. Another reason was our increase in advertising revenue, which related to our performance and ratings. It also had to do with the fact with the World Cup this year as we had some of the matches alongside RTP. We developed new entertainment shows and news shows around the World Cup, and advertisers were eager to work with us. It will be difficult to replicate the same results in 2H2018; however, I am confident that our advertisers will be looking at our products and will continue to advertise with us. We recently hired one of the most important presenters in Portugal, which can be compared to a football team hiring Cristiano Ronaldo. It is expensive for us, although high figures that are being circulated are false, but we expect a great return on this investment.</p><h4>What are your goals and priorities for the year ahead?</h4><p>There are different challenges we face. We have competition from international players. The media landscape is now global but there is no level playing field because rules that apply to established media players don't apply to Netflix, Google, or Facebook. Nonetheless, local quality content is something that we are investing in, not just in terms of telenovelas, but in news and other fiction. When we start developing fictional products, we are always thinking about how they can be exported abroad; stories with a global appeal. For Dubai right now, for example, we have to edit and need to make sure there is certain content is adapted according to preferences. We are doing it systematically rather than ad-hoc. Our main goal is to move into our new building; it's important as a historical milestone since it means SIC will be in the same building as Expresso, something that has never happened in the company's 45 years of history. Our goal is to create synergies in different areas, improve operations, as well as boost creativity and motivation.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Innovation Above All Else]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[innovation-above-all-else]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is innovation being incorporated into DFSA's business plan moving forward?</h4><p>As a regulator, we recognize the importance of innovation and technology to support and enable financial services business models, products, and services. Fintech can enhance and improve the efficiency of markets, and provide better services and solutions. We encourage the development of fintech in the sector and also apply advances in regulatory technology in our own processes. DFSA's fostering of fintech, and use of technology itself, is reflected by the addition of a new strategic theme—innovation—to DFSA strategic priorities. In this way, we are strongly aligned with the National Innovation Strategy set out by UAE Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, to create an innovation-friendly ecosystem. </p><h4>How does DFSA's Innovation Testing License (ITL) model work, and what have been the key advantages so far?</h4><p>We launched ITL in May 2017, which is what other places might call a regulatory sandbox. This enables firms to operate in a controlled environment with reduced regulatory requirements. We need to ensure, first, that their operating model provides the market with something new and innovative. While they are testing out the concept under an ITL, we can determine if there are real benefits, if the product is truly innovative, and whether it can be properly regulated. We might then grant them a full license, and these companies can then go out into the market with a fully-fledged financial product. We have two firms that are already using the license: an automated investment advice service, Sarwa Digital, and real estate crowdfunding platform, SmartCrowd. We continue to receive healthy interest in the ITL from all over the world including the UAE, the UK, the US, Singapore, India, Azerbaijan, and Kazakhstan, covering a wide range of fintech activities. These include remittances via blockchain, digital wallet operations, and various wealth management solutions.</p><h4>How has fintech impacted the economy in Dubai so far, and what is in store for the future?</h4><p>Over recent years the Dubai government has made significant advances in providing online and mobile services, using technology to be more efficient and effective in the provision of public services. The Dubai Plan 2021 sets out goals that would take this even further, putting development and use of technology even more at the center of the Dubai economy. DFSA is contributing to these efforts. In August 2017, we announced new crowdfunding rules—a first for the GCC. These are in line with the goals of the Dubai Plan 2021 and will contribute to the development of this funding source for SMEs and the Dubai and UAE economies, with crowdfunding expected to become a more established form of financing for this important sector. There have been a number of crowdfunding offerings opening up in Dubai, and these quickly provide liquidity into the financial system, particularly boosting SME funding.</p><h4>More specifically, what impact can cryptocurrencies have within the financial landscape?</h4><p>Cryptocurrencies have had a significant impact over the last 18 months, fueled by the increase in the price of Bitcoin and the growth of initial coin offerings (ICOs) as a tool for raising money from the public. Using the underlying Distributed Ledger Technology as a vehicle for transactions that can take place quicker, cheaper, and in a more secure manner is highly attractive. Digital assets themselves are not without risks; they are not legal tender and can also lend themselves to anonymous transactions, posing risks of money laundering and terrorism financing. Some ICOs are not based on genuine business or economic propositions, and have effectively been frauds. It remains to be seen how the global regulatory community will respond to digital assets. Like many others, we are assessing our risk tolerance in this area. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess CBD's contribution to the development and growth of Dubai over the past decades?</h4><p>In 2019, CBD will celebrate its 50th anniversary, which makes it one of the first local banks established in the UAE. Our contribution to the growth of Dubai has been substantial. Many of our clients started out with us as small companies and are today large conglomerates. Moreover, CBD has financed or provided banking services to many of the projects that were crucial to the development of Dubai. In addition, CBD has played a key role in the development of local talent and has an ambitious graduate recruitment program, where we hire fresh UAE graduates every year with the plan of offering them a career in the bank. Even if not all of them stay with us, we are proud to deliver well-educated and well-trained graduates to the market at large.</p><h4>How do you assess the progress the banking sector is making with digitalization?</h4><p>Dubai and the GCC at large are well advanced. Digital apps in this region are as good or even better than those found in international banks. Moreover, this region is far ahead of the West in terms of ATM functionality, as users can pay utility bills or participate in IPOs through ATMs. Mobile penetration in general is high, though mobile banking still lags somewhat behind countries such as Sweden or the Netherlands, where almost no one goes to bank branches anymore. In early 2017, we launched CBD NOW, the first digital-only bank in the UAE, and despite its success, we decided we needed to do better. Rather than launching a digital bank, we wanted to make the whole bank digital. We firmly established becoming digital as a key target for the bank and made excellent progress over the past year. The biggest challenge in digitization is the end-to-end process. Offering a digital front end is easy, however, the challenge is making existing processes digital: zero touch, paperless, and real time, straight through.</p><h4>How do you view the impact of fintech on the banking sector?</h4><p>Fintech has successfully changed people's user experiences, and people now expect something similar to come from banks. However, most fintech applications are still built on a banking infrastructure, and there are only a few fintechs revolutionizing the core banking infrastructure. Blockchain will play a major role going forward in sharing documents in a secured way, though I do not see it playing a major part soon in massive real-time operations like cross-border payments. Artificial intelligence and machine learning will play an extremely important role in areas such as fraud detection and compliance, though the marketing approach of companies will also change completely once machine learning is fully deployed. Regional banks are not too far advanced in this field and have to make up ground with the international banks that are absolutely stunning in that space. The endgame for fintech companies will be amalgamating with banks, because they are natural partners. This will happen through partnerships and investments between banks and fintech players, and creating an environment in which they can assist each other.</p><h4>How can Dubai further work toward its goal of being the preferred investment destination for foreign capital in the context of Dubai Plan 2021?</h4><p>If we look at ease of doing business here, it is by far the number-one destination in the Arab world. And the supportive, well-functioning, and transparent government is a big factor in this. Many helpful laws and regulations have been introduced, including the bankruptcy law in 2017 that was a big step forward. The geographical location helps, because Dubai is a natural hub between the west and east. If we combine all that and look at the initiatives the Dubai government has taken to enhance the competitiveness of local business, we have a great starting point.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Bank of  the Future]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[bank-of-the-future]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess Mashreq Bank's contribution to the development and growth of Dubai over the past decades?</h4><p>Since its inception 50 years ago, Mashreq has not stopped distinguishing itself as a bank of the future. Innovation has been deeply embedded in the DNA of Mashreq throughout; since its foundation in 1967, Mashreq has enabled some of the UAE's iconic projects. The bank has always been at the heart of Dubai's economic boom, undertaking initiatives that were deemed impossible. Starting with the deepening of the Creek in the 1960s, Mashreq enabled the construction of the Dubai's most significant infrastructure projects such as Dubai International Airport, Burj Al Arab, Dubai Metro, Burj Khalifa, and Palm Jumeirah—the first offshore development of its kind at the time; it was built in 2003 for about USD5 billion. Mashreq's commitment to making its customers' lives simpler was evidenced when it introduced industry-first innovative products, such as credit card, ATM, and state-of-the-art mobile banking app. The launch of Mashreq Neo—the UAE's first full-fledged digital bank—is another example of how we addressed emerging customer needs. It also marked a new era in the digital transformation as digital commerce and cashless payments were identified as top government priorities. Mashreq's commitment to a digital future is closely aligned to its strategy of investing heavily in its people, and further developing the Emirati talent pool; Mashreq is one of the few banking institutions to have a dedicated national development program. Notably, the number of UAE nationals who have joined the bank in the past five years has grown exponentially, highlighting the bank's commitment to supporting the UAE's vision to grow future leaders and to foster an empowered Emirati workforce.</p><h4>How do you access the potential for Dubai becoming a leading regional Fintech hub?</h4><p>Dubai boasts an unmatched infrastructure and innovation ecosystem, providing a perfect environment for technology and disruptive businesses. In 2017, the Dubai International Financial Center (DIFC) established a USD100 million fund to invest in fintech start-ups. Since 2010, roughly USD100 billion has been invested globally into the fintech industry according to Accenture, clearly demonstrating an immense appetite for its development. Moreover, FinTech Hive, DIFC's start-up accelerator, is one of the first fintech accelerators in the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia region, and Mashreq is a first-round partner in this initiative. Mashreq has managed to stay ahead of the game so far. We have been making significant investments in artificial intelligence, robotics, and future technology over the past two years. This means Mashreq is lessening its reliance on human resources as it prepares for the digital future.</p><h4>Dubai has been working towards the goal of being the preferred investment destination for foreign capital. How do you assess the success of these efforts?</h4><p>Dubai attracted USD7.4 billion of inward FDI last year, a 7.1% YoY increase bolstered by investment projects from the US, Europe, and Saudi Arabia. In particular, the emirate is a top global destination to invest in technology and technology transfer, with medium- and high-tech ventures accounting for more than 60% of investment projects, the latest Dubai FDI Monitor report said. The UAE government has been taking steps to increase FDI inflows. These measures include encouraging new businesses to set up in free trade zones with lower registration costs, streamlining regulation in emerging growth sectors such as Fintech, and announcing plans to relax corporate ownership laws. Dubai's performance can be regarded as reasonably well in a not-so-good global trading environment. </p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead?<br></h4><p>The economic outlook looks positive with firmer oil prices, easing fiscal consolidation, and the pickup of global trade and investments ahead of Expo 2020. Our key areas of growth will be contract financing, education, healthcare, energy and renewables, and real estate. Outside the UAE, we have a target of around 25-30% revenue contribution from our international franchise. Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and India are important markets for us and we have already launched several initiatives in these countries. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Performance Benchmark]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[performance-benchmark]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess the development of DIB in recent years?</h4><p>In the last four years, DIB has transformed into a regional powerhouse in the world of finance. Our successful growth strategy has led to significant enhancement of all key metrics, particularly those around profitability and returns leading to the bank joining the “billion-dollar profit club" for the first time. While growth and profitability make me proud, what truly hits the mark is the fact that the bank had its best performance in times that were genuinely challenging for all. The real success lies in having changed the market perception about our institution. Today, the market views the bank not just as a performance benchmark for Islamic finance, but also for the entire banking sector.</p><h4>How can Dubai further strengthen its position as the global capital of Islamic finance?</h4><p>Dubai's commitment to Islamic finance is irrefutable. It was the Emirate that first introduced the concept by establishing the world's first fully fledged commercial Islamic bank, and ever since, it has continued to support the sector's development into what is today, a flourishing industry. We consider ourselves extremely fortunate to be headquartered in Dubai. The government focus on the development of Islamic economy as a whole has been a massive factor in enabling us to break the age-old myth that Islamic finance is a niche offering with limited scope. The sector's growth has far outpaced its counterpart, and the last decade has clearly shown that the segment cannot only compete head to head with conventional players, but can, in fact, surpass them in many aspects. Additionally, the Dubai government's unwavering commitment to this industry is fully aligned with its aspiration to become the global capital for Islamic economy.</p><h4>What is the significance of fintech to the Islamic finance industry?</h4><p>The challenges in the new digital world are the same for Islamic finance and its conventional counterpart. With changing family needs, disappearing cultural barriers, and enhanced lifestyle, it is inevitable that financial services will have to follow suit and evolve accordingly. Hence, I expect to see more opportunities and many new avenues, though one has to be nimble, decisive, and ready to act. The world is moving fast, and technological advancements will only see an acceleration going forward. The choice is, thus, to evolve or dissolve. With the global fintech industry expected to triple in the coming five years to over USD150 billion, the financial sector also continues to evolve. The UAE leads fintech evolution in the MENA region, with nearly 30% of start-ups based here. We, as financial institutions, are at a crossroads; we need these start-ups just as much as they need us, so it is about complementing rather than competing. It is about embracing rather than excluding, and it is about using the latest development in the industry to our advantage.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the future of Islamic finance both in Dubai and globally?</h4><p>Islamic finance is fast becoming a norm in the financial world. Statistics from across the world show extremely positive trends and high levels of liquidity amongst GCC investors, and other predominantly Muslim markets continue to push the industry northbound. Perhaps, the real driver is the changing attitudes of the sector being limited to Muslims. Islamic finance and banking are now globally accepted by customers and investors, who make decisions analyzing both types of institutions in the same manner. Dubai started the concept with DIB, and the last four decades have seen the Emirate truly take the lead. The ambition of becoming the global capital of Islamic economy will be another major boost for the Islamic finance industry.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the coming year?</h4><p>2018 is the culminating year of our 10-year strategic master plan. The last five years of that plan have been focused on an unprecedented growth agenda. We were ambitious from the start, and perhaps, the market was slightly skeptical about us in the earlier years. However, seeing our performance, this skepticism is rapidly dissipating and replaced by even higher expectations. Our financial guidance for the year continues to be well above the existing market trends, and we expect our market share to continue to grow this year. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How was 2017 for CELSIA?</h4><p>It was a spectacular year; we surpassed all our expectations. We were able to meet all our security indexes goals, as well as all the financial items we reported. In addition, 2017 was an excellent year in terms of revenue as we were able to achieve 110% income growth.</p><h4>What are the main details of your alliance with Grupo Provivienda?</h4><p>Provivienda and CELSIA have entered into an agreement to create a win-win project for the entire solar sector. We are involved in a project in which we will install 1,062 solar panels in the first phase, able to serve energy to 354 houses. In 2H2018, we estimate to have the first 20 houses ready and the remaining 334 houses shall be finished in 2019. In our business model, the price of the house includes the on-site solar solution and, therefore, the client can enjoy clean energy as soon as he acquires the house. Our joint goal with Provivienda is to develop 10,000 houses with solar energy within a decade.</p><h4>What is the appeal of the Honduran market for CELSIA's expansion plans?</h4><p>We are entering the Honduran market this year with the development of 10-MW solar power farm for Cementos Argos, a cement plant. Once settled in the country, we expect to find new opportunities in the industrial sector, particularly in the city of San Pedro Sula and the free trade zones. Additionally, we are looking forward to provide trigeneration systems (cooling, heating, and power) for the textile industry.</p><h4>What is the importance of Panama for CELSIA?</h4><p>The operation in Central America represents almost 24% of the company's EBITDA and revenue, with Panama  alone representing around 20% of this EBITDA and revenue and 6% of EBITDA and revenue for Grupo Argos. Panama is our main financial headquarters in the region because of its connectivity and other advantages, notably its stable and strong economy and key geographical location. We are also starting to expand in distributed generation opportunities, which is a product that we foresee to have great demand in the country. Additionally, we have a project in Chiriquí­ to develop two solar power plants with a capacity between 10MW and 20MW.   When this project is completed, the company's energy matrix in Panama will be 6% solar, 60% thermal, and 34% hydro. On the other hand, in Costa Rica we have a 55-MW wind farm, which we expect to double in size in the near future. </p><h4>What steps are you taking to promote industrial safety?</h4><p>Industrial safety is a challenge and an important policy for us. We are developing a safety culture in the company and are carrying out a program to achieve this. Safety is paramount to CELSIA, and we want to continue to expand in this area.</p><h4>What is the main challenge in Panama's energy sector?</h4><p>There are many challenges but the biggest one it to restructure Panama's transmission network. There are new players coming into the market as well, more so because of the progress in current discussions about the legal framework that regulates the country's energy sector. Therefore, we as a company need to be cautious about any upcoming competition and plan accordingly to further improve our services. In addition, there are certain issues with renewing long-term contracts that have been signed with private companies, and it remains to be seen how these will end up.</p><h4>What are your goals for Panama in 2018?</h4><p>We want to meet our safety and security goals and ensure that our generation assets are sustainable. Moreover, we need to strictly follow our timelines to complete all our solar and distributed generation projects. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[let-there-be-water]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How long have you been present in Latin America, and what are your specific projects in Panama? </h4><p><span></span>SUEZ has been present in Latin America for more than 80 years. In this region, 34 million people do not have access to an improved drinking-water source; SUEZ started activities in this region building the first wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Lima and Brasí­lia. Then, throughout the years, the group extended its expertise to Argentina, Chile, Mexico, and Colombia. We have been operating in Panama since 2009, when SUEZ was chosen by the Ministry of Health to build and operate Panama's first WWTP. Located in Juan Diaz and in operation since 2013, this plant treats wastewater of 1.2 million people living in the capital. In 2017, the ministry awarded a new contract to SUEZ in order to double the treatment capacity of the plant to up to 475,200 cubic meters (cbm) per day. Moreover, we are currently working with the National Institution of Sewerage Systems for the construction and operation of the sewer network and a treatment plant in the city of David.</p><h4>You are currently building the extension of the WWTP of Panama City; can you tell us more about this project? </h4><p>The expansion of the WWTP began in May 2017 and it will last three years, during which the treatment activities of the first module must remain operational. Today, the pipes and basement are finished, and we are now completing the engineering. We are starting the construction of different buildings within a two-year timeline. In 2020, the plant will treat wastewater of 2 million inhabitants and will be equipped with a water treatment and sludge treatment line through which the treated water will be discharged in full compliance with national standards. </p><h4>Why is Panama a key country regarding SUEZ's regional activities? </h4><p>Over the past few years, Panama has invested the most in various project related to water treatment in Latin America. The decontamination of the Bay of Panama began in 2001 with the "Sanitation Program of the Bay of Panama." As we are leader in the water treatment field, it is highly important for us to support Panama in this challenge. Moreover, this country is an excellent platform to develop business in the region, and this is why our office in Panama is the company's regional headquarters.</p><h4>What are your ambitions regarding the development of industrial activities in the country? </h4><p>SUEZ has the ambition to provide urban areas and industries with effective support to meet new challenges, which are all linked to sustainable management of resources. The company's industrial business is managed by its newly created division, SUEZ Water Technology and Solutions (SWTS), which is a merger between SUEZ Industry and General Electric Water, acquired in 2017.</p><h4>What are the most immediate challenges that need to be addressed in Panama? </h4><p>In Panama, water cycle management is a huge challenge. When compared with Europe, water consumption in Panama is extremely high, with figures as high as 600 liters per citizen per day. In Spain, for example, the figure is about 100 liters per citizen. In Panama, this can be explained by the fact that most of the water is being wasted in leakages. We are working on improving the infrastructure to tackle this issue across Panama. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the milestones and major transformations for TAP over the past few years?</h4><p>TAP Air Portugal was owned by the state until 2015. Due to restrictions in the European framework, TAP Air Portugal was not a profitable company and the Portuguese state could not capitalize the company. Between 2009 and 2015, Portugal had a tough time, with the bailout between 2011 and 2014, and we had a difficult task convincing investors that we were worth investing in. Conversations surrounding the privatization of TAP solidified in 2015 because of Portugal's agreement with Troika, the IMF, the European Commission, and the European Central Bank (ECB). TAP was subsequently privatized and the shareholder agreement was reconfigured so that the state could remain a shareholder. TAP is a successful example of a public-private partnership (PPP); 50% is owned by the state and 50% is owned by private shareholders. It is a company that is extremely dear to Portuguese people, as everyone feels as though they are a part owner of TAP. This ensures a great environment and atmosphere within the company and is also great outside because it does not make room for rumors and creates a calm environment for the company to operate. Since the privatization we have been accomplishing an ambitious strategic plan which complies renovating and expanding our fleet, reaching a lot more destinations, whether in Europe or North America, South America and Africa and, consequently, carrying more passengers.</p><h4>Can you provide an overview of your key routes and new aircraft?</h4><p>Currently, our fleet is composed of 90 planes, and the plan is to have 120 or 125 in four or five years. We have also added many new routes. We have an important position in Latin America, mainly in Brazil; we are the most important European carrier connecting Europe to Brazil and have roughly one-third of the market. We serve 10 destinations in Brazil and will serve 12 in one or two years' time. We will expand our operation in North America significantly—both the US and Canada—are more than doubling our destinations in the US. In Canada, we fly to Toronto. We will also expand in Africa and Europe and adding more destinations. From 2019, we plan to fly to Washington, Chicago, Tel Aviv, Montreal, and San Francisco. In Europe, we will have, from Lisbon, Tenerife, Dublin, Basel, Naples, and from Porto, Brussels, Lyon, and Munich. In the coming years, we will have plenty more destinations. TAP is growing significantly, and we are benefiting from (and also contributing to) Portugal's popularity globally. We are experiencing growth pains and need to recruit more pilots and cabin crew and order new planes. There will also come a point when we will need better infrastructure, as we have already been suffering and will continue to suffer from the bottlenecks in the airport (because we are responsible for more than 50% of the traffic in the airport). There are plans to expand Lisbon Airport by opening a new terminal in 2021 — but until then we need improvements in the current infrastructure (facilities, parking for planes, runway, among others), as we want to continue to grow and transport more passengers. In 2017, we reached a new high of 14.5 million passengers, and in 2018 we hope to achieve 16 million. We are growing at a great pace but need the infrastructure to become more productive.</p><h4>What is the importance of the business class segment, and what is your strategy to increase the customer base of TAP Corporate?</h4><p>The segment is extremely important. If we want to create more value and ensure passengers remain loyal to the airline, we have to treat them well and ensure we provide excellent service. We are in the process of renovating and expanding the fleet, as I have already mentioned. Many planes are over 15 years old, and we have ordered many new planes from Airbus for long-, medium-, and short-haul flights.</p><h4>What are your key priorities for 2019?</h4><p>We seek to continue to grow and grow with quality, meaning serving our customers better. That is what we are more focused on, and with the arrival of the new aircraft, our service onboard and in the airports will be much more efficient and spare customers a great deal of trouble and bureaucracy. We will also look at technological advances where necessary. We are on the right track.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you see the UAE's regional and global leadership in promoting clean energy?</h4><p>The UAE is a regional leader in developing and deploying clean energy solutions and technology. An excellent example of such leadership is Masdar, which sends a strong message to the whole world that the country is making waves in the renewable energy sector. Furthermore, the UAE's commitment to promoting renewable energy received global acknowledgement when the country was chosen to host the permanent headquarters of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) in its capital, Abu Dhabi, in 2009. The fact that one of the world's leading hydrocarbon producers can compete with established players in the field of renewable energy reaffirms the UAE's commitment to reducing its ecological footprint and transitioning to a climate-resilient green economy. Locally, we have mega projects such as Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park in Dubai, the largest single-site solar park in the world with a planned capacity of 1GW by 2020 and 5GW by 2030. Several other projects of around 400MW have already been connected to the grid, and we have positive expectations for further additions in 2019. Furthermore, Masdar is bidding for renewable energy projects in Saudi Arabia and Oman, transferring our experience abroad, and supporting development ventures around the world, especially on remote islands, where communities are in dire need of power supply. We are also extremely active in improving efficiency in energy supply and promoting demand-side management. We are working on high-tech solutions to produce desalinated water and have had great success in popularizing energy-efficient green buildings. The UAE is one of the top 10 countries globally in terms of cumulative LEED-certified gross sqm outside the US, according to a list revealed by the US Green Building Council (USGBC) in 2017.</p><h4>How do you see the role of the private sector in addressing sustainability challenges and advancing the UAE's economic diversification agenda?</h4><p>The private sector has a vital role to play across industries to advance the sustainability agenda. There are some excellent examples of the growing commitment of the private sector to sustainability. For example, the Majid Al Futtaim Group launched an initiative to be net positive by 2040, starting to embed sustainability in most of its practices and policies. Meanwhile, DP World has embarked on the construction of the largest distributed solar rooftop project in the Middle East, with the installation of 88,000 rooftop solar panels on its Dubai facilities. In a bid to bring the private sector on board to help us achieve our leaders' vision, the Ministry of Climate Change and Environment in 2016 established the “Environment and Business Majlis" with the aim of boosting the contribution of the private sector and aligning it with the government's environmental strategies. Furthermore, the Ministry recently launched the “UAE Green Business Toolkit" to inspire companies across the country to become eco-friendlier and socially responsible and enhance awareness about ways to operate greener.</p><h4>What role can green finance models and green fiscal policy play in the transition to a green economy?</h4><p>Green finance is something we take seriously. We work in close cooperation with financial institutions and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Finance Initiative to ensure readiness to support and finance promising projects. Locally, Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) announced a USD27 billion green fund in 2016 that offers loans to investors in the clean energy sector at reduced interest rates, and First Abu Dhabi Bank has committed USD10 billion in financing over the next 10 years toward the clean energy sector. In 2016, we announced the Dubai Declaration on Sustainable Finance, signed by 32 UAE financial institutions that committed to supporting the UAE's transition to a green economy. Garnering the backing of financial institutions and understanding green technology requirements is crucial. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you evaluate the work done by the new Ministry of Environment?</h4><p>The Varela administration has laid the legal and organizational foundation for the state to move toward a green economy. The design and establishment of longer-term policy frameworks and green financing mechanisms in water security, forest restoration, biodiversity management, and ecotourism in protected areas are set to generate an unprecedented number of green jobs over the next 10 years. Panama's 2015-2050 Water Security Plan features an investment portfolio of 556 water projects worth around USD11 billion. The government created the National Water Council (CONAGUA) to oversee the plan and spearhead the modernization of the water sector. With regard to the forest sector, a PPP for the Million Hectares initiative now has its own legal basis (Law 69 of 2017). Also, the Reforesta Panamá Fund, allowing for USD15 million to be invested yearly in forestry projects for the next 20 years. Panama will also house four world-class biodiversity related centers: the International Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (ICGEB), International Center for the Implementation of Emission Reduction from Degradation and Deforestation (ICIREDD), Biodiversity and Drug Discovery Center, and Innova Park. Additionally, the current administration has paved the way for mainstreaming green tourism into the sustainable livelihood formula of Panama's rural communities. It is no secret that Panama has done an outstanding job by declaring about 40% of its territory under some sort of conservation protection, which is three times larger than the global average. It is envisioned to secure the country's water, forest, and biodiversity heritage. On the back of these initiatives, Panama is poised to become a key global player in the fields of water entrepreneurship, biodiversity and biotechnology R&amp;D, forest management and carbon trading, and ecotourism.</p><h4>What are the main highlights of the National Environment Agenda 2014-2019, and which issues are still pending?</h4><p>The state-wide environmental modernization is the main highlight of the current administration. To support the modernization process, the ministry's annual budget has doubled from USD34 million in 2014 to USD68.5 million in 2018. In four years, we have approved investment projects worth USD49 billion through an improved system for environmental feasibility evaluation. With regard to civil society participation, the ministry has signed over 80 MoUs with non-governmental organizations, community-based organizations, as well as domestic and international R&amp;D organizations to implement projects for wildlife protection, forest and watershed management, participatory environmental planning, and policy development. Public dialogs to upgrade environmental policies have been essential to gradually transform the relationship of rural communities with the surrounding national heritage. We are institutionalizing town hall-style monthly meetings to touch base with all citizens and stakeholders. Informed public participation is vital for any country to move up the sustainable development ladder.</p><h4>What are your main initiatives to control illegal logging and to encourage reforestation?</h4><p>We implemented the first ever electronic system to track wood harvesting and transport, helping us ensure that 100% of the wood produced is certified. It has also assisted us in tracking illegal activity, leading to an increase in arrests of illegal loggers, particularly in Darién. The government is aware that forests are key to the future of water resources and the economic benefit resulting from community-based ecotourism. For the past four years, the President and the whole cabinet has joined the civil society in planting trees throughout the country. Notably, the president announced the launch of a program to halve jail time of those inmates who work on reforestation projects.</p><h4>What are your targets and priorities for the year ahead?</h4><p>We want to eradicate poor plastic garbage management practices because they pollute the environment and directly affects Panama's wildlife.  Panama was the first country in the region to unanimously pass a zero-waste target and plastic bag ban and is on the right track to sort out such society-wide behavioral imperfection. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you expect e-commerce to evolve in the UAE over the coming years?</h4><p>The largest players in the world are positioning themselves in the UAE; Amazon recently acquired souq.com and is now setting up shop logistically in Dubai South. Companies are shifting more toward e-commerce and investing heavily in their own platforms. Dubai typically has a learning curve followed by a spike. We do not have an easy S-curve that develops and grows over a period of time. We incubate, and today 2-3% of retail sales happen through e-commerce. The figure is likely to shoot up before plateauing. We will see a spike in 2018 and 2019. There will be a major transformation now that there are two generations more accustomed to e-commerce than other types of purchases. Primarily, makeup and clothes are already primarily moving into e-commerce, which is changing the retail landscape. Younger people now prefer to browse and shop on their phones rather than at malls, which will soon start to kick in economically, and repeated purchases will become more automated. High-end retail may be able to retain clients if the experience goes beyond just visiting the store. If not, they too will become part of the migration to digital. Physical purchases will never become completely obsolete, though the experience will start to become an important complement to purchases. A unique experience has to be embedded into their services.</p><h4>Traditional media is facing headwinds as a result of on-demand services. How do you expect this trend to develop in the Middle East?</h4><p>Currently, we are still catching on to the influx of content. Digital will mean more to companies such as Disney, Netflix, and Hulu; it will replace TV. The development of content itself will change, though not the medium; it will still be phones, tablets, computers, and TVs. The way content is presented has changed and media at large has become less expensive. Now, it all boils down to the most basic element of the story: storytelling and the creation of the content itself. Now there is also a reverse migration from digital to reality. People are using digital platforms to see Rome or Paris, for example. Digital media promotes real-life experiences for people to experience them first hand.</p><h4>What is the philosophy behind the Entrepreneur and Media Hub that AAHG is Developing?</h4><p>We are establishing NOMAD, a unique world-class pioneering project to facilitate and support the growth of local and international entrepreneurs and position the UAE as a leading light in global business innovation. It will significantly reduce the cost of operating in the UAE for start-ups representing the media, culinary arts, arts and design, and gaming and technology arenas. The biggest challenge for Dubai is that it is a young and expensive city, which does not make it an ideal place for start-ups, so we are effectively adding an additional landscape to the Emirate that does not exist yet. Our plan is to prototype the project in Dubai, allowing someone to live and run a business at affordable and globally competitive pricing. The participants will have their own apartments, offices, visas, and meals included in that cost. We are building a flexible ecosystem where the start-up does not have to employ everyone around them; they can still outsource services that are not key to the business. This ecosystem will cost a pre-determined amount, which will be valued by our participants because the costs of employing people for all of their requirements and day-to-day tasks would be significantly higher. We are also encouraging participants to be innovative by mixing with an international community from whose environment they will prosper. </p><h4>Will this program complement or replace existing incubators or accelerators in the entrepreneurial sphere?</h4><p>The project will be an incubator and an accelerator, co-existing within a purpose-built infrastructure in a unique eco-system, the first of its kind. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[The Art of Good Governance]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[the-art-of-good-governance]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is Hawkamah shaping the corporate governance landscape in the MENA region?</h4><p>We have what we call the Hawkamah Process, which consists of four key pillars: awareness creation, policy advocacy, training courses, and implementation. Awareness creation is done with governments, regulators, and private sector actors. Within policy advocacy, we work with entities to improve on-the-ground activities. For example, we work with regulators and stock exchanges to improve listing rules, and interact with the government to make sure they have clear manuals for publicly owned companies and government institutions. Policy advocacy is where we talk about the specific things governments and regulators can do to push the agenda of governance in their constituencies. In our training courses pillar, we qualify people to sit on boards and be corporate governance advocates in their own companies. There is now a mandate for companies to have company secretaries and investment regulation officers, and we train these people to ensure they are aware of all the issues surrounding corporate governance. The final pillar is working with companies on the actual implementation. We go to ministries, state-owned companies, listed companies, banks, and family businesses to do corporate governance assessments and gap analyses to see how we can work together, improve, and help companies understand corporate governance and adherence to regulations. </p><h4>How does Hawkamah promote women's representation on boards and leadership positions?</h4><p>Global numbers show that women make a difference when they are on boards, so there is a business case for it. We are one of the founders of the GCC Chapter of the 30% Club, a UK-based initiative pushing women onto boards and into top management positions. We have done research on the subject: what is really happening, what are the challenges, and how can we handle these. We are working with regulators on the idea of listing rules and also do board briefings. Many of the boards we used to go to consisted only of men, so we explained to them the value of including women. We also work on the training side, establishing and launching a program three years ago with the Dubai Women's Establishment, headed by Sheikha Manal bint Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum. In most cases, when a woman is appointed to a board, she will be the only one. Since we want to help them to have the confidence to add value, we offer training courses on how to be effective board members. </p><h4>How does the S&amp;P Hawkamah ESG Pan Arab Index incentivize good governance?</h4><p>Seven years ago, we launched this index with S&amp;P to establish a benchmark to compare countries in terms of corporate governance. Since we started the index three years before launching it to establish a track record, it really has 10 years of information and data. The index focuses on the 11 largest markets in the region, and we explore 200 variables of environmental, social, and corporate governance factors within listed companies. We were aiming to create competition between companies, and this drive to the top is exactly what we witnessed. In addition, investors look at the companies in the index and create portfolios based on that information. Our studies show that ROI is higher among the companies that are tracked by this index. This is why companies are competing to be on our index, as well as to be at the top. Every year, we announce the top-10 companies in the region in addition to the top 50. Those that want to be in the top 10 ask us what they need to do to gain entry to this listing, which is when we explain their weaknesses. This is a healthy competition that is a highly effective way for Hawkamah to promote corporate governance. We also have an agreement with Dubai Financial Market (DFM) in which we mandate certain governance requirements for listed companies in Dubai. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the key achievements for DAFZA in the past year?</h4><p>DAFZA has achieved strong year on year business results and made significant progress across key projects and initiatives in the past year. We recently announced the results for 1H2018, showing an 11% growth in EBID in comparison with the same period of 2017, and a growth of new rental revenues by 27%. The results included a 10% increase in licensing revenues and a 31% increase in revenues from government services, resulting in total revenue growth of 8% on 1H2017. DAFZA also achieved a solid 15% growth in the number of registered companies over the same period in 2017, providing global and regional investors across a wide range of industries with the ideal business-friendly environment, and a seamless customer experience supported by world-class infrastructure, high quality services and logistics facilities. There was also a 5% increase in the number of multinational companies at DAFZA, a direct result of our high-quality services enabling businesses to expand in the Middle East, Africa, and Central Asia and explore high investment opportunities in the region. These positive figures were delivered as a result of DAFZA's strategic plan set in early 2017, which is in line with the ambitious objectives of Dubai Plan 2021. One of the key elements of the plan is to support Dubai in becoming one of the most innovative and progressive cities to host world-class free zones across the globe.</p><h4>What makes DAFZA a strong ecosystem for international companies looking to regionally expand?</h4><p>DAFZA's ecosystem integrates world-class infrastructure with the strategic location of Dubai to provide the highest level of services and meet the needs of customers. DAFZA ensures its offerings meet international market requirements, economic policies, and developments across various global business sectors. Through its strategic location, multinational companies have the opportunity to not only achieve strong performance, but also to drive growth and expansion into emerging regional markets. This is made possible through DAFZA's vast portfolio of exceptional services, world-class facilities, advanced infrastructure, smart solutions and investment facilities, and an environment conducive to business, investment, and innovation. The 1H2018 results highlight the flexible business and investment environment provided by DAFZA to its various segments of global investors.</p><h4>To which markets would you like to expand DAFZA's reach?</h4><p>Core markets for DAFZA are based on their foreign direct investments in the UAE, both in terms of value and number of projects. Generally, DAFZA is focused on attracting investment and business opportunities from a wide number of markets, including China, India, South Korea, South America and Europe. We also organized a series of investment seminars called Gateway to Growth in India, China, Spain, Germany, Switzerland, and Korea. These roadshows aimed to introduce the opportunities, investment advantages, advanced facilities, and global infrastructure that DAFZA provides.  </p><h4>How does DAFZA support SME growth?</h4><p>The first half of 2018 witnessed an increase in the number of registered SMEs by 17%. This confirms the success of DAFZA's focus on providing integrated solutions and services that ensure business growth for each segment. There has been a particular focus on helping SMEs increase their collaboration with several public and private entities in line with the vision of the UAE and Dubai governments to develop the sector and help grow the national economy.</p><h4>How will the Dubai Blink platform help in meeting the needs of future global trade?</h4><p>The Dubai Blink project was designed to support government plans to create smart, digital and innovation-driven economies. It was launched to benefit from the growing global e-commerce market valued at around USD7.7 trillion in 2017. DAFZA has begun the implementation of Dubai Blink, the world's first e-commerce platform for free zones companies to utilize artificial intelligence, blockchain technology, and virtual business licenses adopted as part of Dubai 10X. We have also organized a series of workshops between free zones and government entities to disseminate the project. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been DMCC's biggest accomplishments over the past year?</h4><p>DMCC was awarded the number-one free zone in the world for the third year running by fDi Magazine, which illustrates how we are viewed both locally and internationally. This accomplishment stems from our DNA of continuously evolving and creating more value for our member companies over and above registration, licensing, and regulation. DMCC is constantly enhancing customer service levels, creating new products, services, and clusters of excellence for the industries that are part of our free zone. In 2017, we focused on four key markets: India, China, the UK, and Germany. </p><h4>What features make DMCC Free Zone a strong ecosystem for international companies that want to grow their business in this region?</h4><p>It is important not to stop at providing licensing and regulation, but to go the extra mile with end-to-end solutions, accessibility, and the right customer experience. We are a vibrant SME hub, supporting SMEs wherever they need help, most commonly with business applications, insurance products, and residence visas for dependents. Within our free zone, there are hubs around certain themes, such as an ecosystem for tech start-ups called AstroLabs, which has over 120 companies and is the region's premier co-working space and learning academy for digital technology companies. Another such start-up hub, concentrated around health, wellness, and wellbeing, is due to open soon as well. Large corporations that come here also benefit from operating in an existing ecosystem. Jumeirah Lakes Towers (JLT) consists of a community of 68 high-rise residential and commercial towers. This infrastructure enables people to both set up their business and live here. Many free zones are rather industrial in nature, whereas with DMCC's JLT, everything is at your doorstep.</p><h4>In which commodities can DMCC add value?</h4><p>We look at any commodity in which Dubai can add value, either because of our proximity to growth markets for these commodities or because we can provide the infrastructure to draw more trade in a structured fashion. When we were set up in 2002, Dubai's diamond trade was roughly a USD3 billion industry and largely unstructured. In response, we launched the Dubai Diamond Exchange (DDE), and today that trade has risen to about USD27 billion, putting Dubai in the world's top-three diamond trading centers. Dubai has long been recognized as a city of gold and in 2002, gold trade was worth about USD6 billion. Today, gold trade with Dubai stands at almost USD60 billion. The Emirate is a world-leading bullion center and is no longer purely focused on jewellery as it was in the past. We have achieved this feat through creating infrastructure and standards that have actually raised the quality of trade. The Almas Vault, located underneath the Almas Tower in JLT, is the largest non-sovereign vault in the Middle East and is used by refineries and banks. Dubai has the second largest refinery grid outside Switzerland, and most of it is centred around this free zone. DMCC has worked with the OECD for the last seven years to create a standard called the Dubai Good Delivery (DGD) standard, which certifies quality but also assures responsible sourcing of gold to prevent conflict gold entering the supply chain. We have done the same with the tea industry: last year we handled 53 million kilos of tea, up from 42 million the year before. The DMCC Tea Centre is a tea marketplace where planters bring in their tea in bulk for processing. We also provide all of the required infrastructure and services, including warehousing, tea bag production, and specialty blending. We are also developing the DMCC Coffee Centre. Coffee consumption in the region is growing by about 7-8% annually, whereas globally growth is 2-3%. It will likely handle 20 million kilos of coffee each year and has already signed agreements with representatives of the Yunnan Province in China to bring high-quality Arabica coffee into the facility. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Seeing  the Future]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[seeing-the-future]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the role and mission of DFF?</h4><p>DFF is an entity, or as I like to call it, an engine that is mandated to enable both the public and private sector alike to adopt new technologies, acquire advanced skills, and always be above the curve when it comes to the latest technologies and future trends. Sheikh Mohammed once said, “The future is not built on possibilities and numbers but on clarity of vision, planning, action, and implementation." With that in mind, this outlined a far-sighted approach that placed future readiness at the very core of what we do in the foundation. DFF was established just over two years ago to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of Dubai through our three main pillars; Platforms, Thought Leadership, and Future Projects. Our role is to be the catalyst in prompting change and promoting innovation, and we do that by bringing together individuals, organizations, and government entities to share that vision and to implement the reality. We inspire and draw together thinkers, visionaries, and creators to help ideate the future. One of the ways we do this is through the Dubai Future Academy, where we invite industry pioneers and experts in the latest fields of blockchain, artificial intelligence, sustainability, IoT, 3D printing technologies, and autonomous transportation to equip coming generations and leaders with the right tools and knowledge to anticipate future trends and always be ahead of the curve. We believe that education is collaborative and an ongoing journey for one's self-development. We also provide the environment and resources needed to promote disruptive, positive change through incubating and prototyping, which can be seen in another of our initiatives, the Dubai Future Accelerator program. Through a nine-week period, the program provides a platform for government entities, startups, and well-established companies from around the world to explore and test solutions that address future challenges within each sector. Such challenges range from water safety and security to 3D printing organs and even providing jobs for refugees. Another of our platforms that promotes collaboration is Area2071, a physical and digital ecosystem that supports public and private sector disruptive collaborations and experiments. Area2071 is strategically linked to the UAE's Centennial Vision 2071. It aims to solve challenges for the next billion people by producing system-level, disruptive questions, and experiments. The solutions to these questions are co-created through collaborations with a wide ecosystem of public and private x-labs, startups, accelerators, incubators, venture capital, and academia.</p><h4>With Dubai 10X, Dubai is positioning itself as a laboratory for governments of the future. What is the vision behind Dubai 10X?</h4><p>Under the direction of Sheikh Mohammed, Dubai 10X has been designed to positively challenge every government entity to think outside of the box, disrupt their existing processes, and design a better future within their sector. Our vision is that Dubai achieves today what other world cities will implement in 10 years. In just 365 days, 36 entities made more than 160 propositions, of which 26 have been approved. For example, one of the 36 participating entities is KHDA, which is disrupting the schooling and education sector through a system in which a student is no longer confined to a physical space in a school. KHDA has now launched a pilot project called “Rahhal," which was founded on the idea that the world is one big classroom. It is a customizable platform that aims to turn any organization into a learning provider, and to turn people into lifelong learners.</p><h4>Which industries in Dubai stand to benefit most from the implementation of a wide 3D-printing strategy?</h4><p>3D-printing is clearly the future of not only building and construction, but also healthcare and education, which is why the DFF and leadership realized its significance. We are aiming to become a global leader in 3D printing, and Sheikh Mohammed has pushed us to the limits by setting a 3D printing strategy, whereby 25% of all buildings constructed will be 3D-printed by 2030. From 2019 onward companies will need to use 3D-printing for at least 2% of production in order to obtain a license to build. It will start by 3D-printing small objects like door knobs and frames, moving gradually to larger parts and building materials. This shows that the vision is not merely a dream we are looking at but one we are actually prepared to execute. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Open for Business: Expo 2020]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[open-for-business-expo-2020]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What impact will Expo 2020 Dubai have on the economy, particularly SMEs?</h4><p>Expo 2020 Dubai will contribute to new business generation, GDP growth, and job creation across the region since it is open to businesses of all sizes, especially SMEs—the pillar of any economy. We already have more than 20,000 companies from 140 countries registered on the expo's e-sourcing portal, more than 14,000 of which are SMEs. More than half of Expo's contracts awarded so far have been won by SMEs.</p><h4>Could you explain the scale of Expo 2020, and how it will tap into new technologies and catalyze further development? </h4><p>More than 200 nations, multilateral organizations, businesses, and educational institutions will participate in Expo 2020, and we expect to welcome 25 million visits, 70% of which are expected to come from outside the UAE. This means we will be the most inclusive World Expo ever. World Expos have introduced cutting-edge innovations for 167 years. We are doing it a little bit differently by implementing innovative services throughout the journey to 2020, such as our Online Marketplace, which connects entrepreneurs and businesses with each other anywhere in the world and helps to boost and expand opportunities. We view technology as an enabler rather than a substitute. In line with our theme, 'Connecting Minds, Creating the Future,' we want to use technology to encourage more interactions between people, not to replace them.</p><h4>How are you working with partners from the public and private sectors to further build Dubai's reputation on the international stage?</h4><p>Since the bid phase, Expo 2020 organizers have worked as a team with the federal government and the rest of the country. Dubai's record win, with 116 votes, was only possible due to strong collaboration. We will continue to work hand in hand with these stakeholders before and during the event. For example, Dubai Electricity and Water Authority  (DEWA) has become our energy partner and supports the fulfillment of our goal to supply 50% of our energy usage from renewable sources. The Roads and Transport Authority is building a metro station right at the Expo site and is enhancing the surrounding road infrastructure and bus services. Commercial partnerships are also playing a vital role. We are working with a variety of world-class brands, including premier partners Accenture, Cisco, DP World, Emirates Airline, Emirates NBD, Etisalat, Nissan, PepsiCo, SAP, and Siemens, as well as official partners DEWA, ENOC, and UPS.</p><h4>To what extent are you involving young people in the journey to 2020?</h4><p>Youth and volunteers are critical to the success of Expo 2020. Our theme carries the word 'future,' and we cannot think of the future without thinking of our youth. Expo 2020's Youth Connect team engages with schoolchildren in the UAE on a daily basis, and schools visit the Expo site to learn about our themes and see how work is progressing. So far, we have engaged with 40,000 students from 140 schools. Many of them will come back in 2020 and see Expo through a different lens.</p><h4>How will you ensure that Expo 2020 leaves a meaningful legacy beyond April 2021?</h4><p>From day one, we have been committed to building a legacy that is meaningful and sustainable. This is based on four pillars: physical, economic, social, and reputational. A large part of this strategy involves the site's transformation after the Expo into District 2020, a world-class mixed-use development and integrated community that will reuse 80% of Expo 2020's built environment. For example, the Sustainability Pavilion will become a Children and Science Centre. The Conference and Exhibition Centre, developed by Dubai World Trade Centre, will eventually be the biggest in the region, helping to expand Dubai's existing reputation for hosting major international events and conferences. Two of our premier partners—Siemens and Accenture—have already committed to establishing a permanent presence within District 2020. </p>]]></richbody0content>

Over the last year, we opened representative offices in Brazil, Panama, Argentina, and India that have complemented our global network and greatly supported our efforts to strengthen our relationships with key stakeholders in these markets. In addition, the chamber organizes several high-level events and trade missions throughout the year that support its strategy to promote Dubai as a preferred investment destination. Many of these events are hosted as part of the chamber's successful Global Business Forum series, which focuses on strengthening Dubai's economic cooperation with emerging markets. All these efforts support the objectives of Dubai Plan 2021 as well as Dubai's economic diversification plans.</p><h4>What are the key sectors where UAE businesses can provide their expertise abroad?</h4><p>UAE companies have vast expertise and capabilities in logistics, aviation, tourism, retail, and hospitality, in addition to a strong appetite for investment and expanding their global footprint. In fact, many of the UAE's leading companies have already established their presence in key markets in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, and we expect this trend to gain momentum as more businesses look abroad for new growth opportunities. At the same time, the UAE's business community has been quick to adapt to new trends and develop capabilities in emerging sectors and fields such as artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, 3D printing, and smart city solutions in line with the objectives of the Dubai Plan 2021.</p><h4>How does Dubai Chamber encourage cooperation between the public and private sectors to enhance competitiveness and ease barriers to trade?</h4><p>As a bridge between business and government, Dubai Chamber plays a key role in facilitating fruitful cooperation and partnerships between Dubai's public and private sectors. These efforts have helped accelerate Dubai's economic growth and development over the years and position the Emirate as a leading example of how great things can be accomplished if various segments of society align their efforts and work together toward a common vision.</p><h4>The chamber recently announced initiatives to support Dubai's new economic stimulus plans. What do these entail, and how will they strengthen Dubai's position as a global business hub?</h4><p>Under the new initiatives, the chamber is coordinating with other government entities to review services and fees with the aim of reducing the cost of doing business in the Emirate, while also working with a newly formed advisory board to boost the contribution of global companies in shaping the regulatory landscape. The council, represented by selected multinational corporations and Fortune 500 companies, represents business interests, strengthens investor confidence, and plays a key role in developing the local economy. I am confident that these unique initiatives will support the growth of Dubai's economy, address challenges facing businesses in the Emirate, and significantly boost investor confidence in the market. </p><h4>How do you assess the potential for Dubai to become a leading global fintech hub?</h4><p>Dubai is well on its way to becoming one of the world's smartest cities, and it is investing a great deal in new technologies and innovative solutions. The adoption of blockchain technology across government entities is a key focus of the Dubai Smart City vision, and it signals a shift away from traditional administration and toward the digitalization of services. Public and private players have been quick to adopt measures to support the growth of the fintech sector in Dubai, and the region's first fintech accelerator was launched in the Emirate, which will provide an opportunity for firms operating in this space to set up and conduct business in the Emirate. Dubai is eyeing USD1 billion in fintech investments by 2022. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Dubai attracted USD7.4 billion of inward FDI in 2017, a 7.1% increase from 2016. What measures and policies have catalyzed this success?</h4><p>There are many factors that have contributed to Dubai's success in sustaining and growing FDI capital flows despite a global decrease in FDI last year. First, Dubai's value proposition for investors is unique. Whether the investor is a multinational company, a medium-sized family business, or a startup, Dubai's strategic advantages as a city of the future, gateway to regional growth markets, and global business hub offers the right opportunities for growth and expansion. Second, Dubai has sustained its global ranking among the top-10 cities in the world in capital flows, number of projects, and reinvestment over the past three years. Last but not least, our strategic focus on future readiness has inspired a host of investor-centric innovative services. Today, Dubai FDI provides a portfolio of in-person and on-demand smart services that cater to the investors' declared and undeclared needs at every stage of their journey and experience. The Dubai FDI Monitor is a good example of Dubai's global leadership on providing an on-demand, Open Data platform to inform investment decisions. Our latest services to be introduced this year include a dedicated investor information portal and the first-of-its-kind FDI Policy Accelerator to keep pace with the shifts and transformations of industry, new business models, and new forms of investments (NFIs).</p><h4>What is the significance of the sharp rise of technology and knowledge-based FDI that Dubai is experiencing? How do you assess Dubai's attractiveness as a global destination to invest in technology and technology transfer? </h4><p>Our leadership has declared the UAE a global laboratory for 4th Industrial Revolution technologies, and strategies and roadmaps are in place for a smart city, deployment of autonomous vehicles, 3D printed buildings, and artificial intelligence, and the Dubai government will be running on blockchain by 2020. Moreover, digital transformation has increased Dubai-based businesses' competitiveness, productivity, and profits. Today, Dubai is already leading the world on FDI technology transfer and ranks third behind Singapore and Shanghai in FDI capital flows into AI and robotics, according to a recent FDI benchmarking study by FT Markets. According to Dubai FDI Monitor data, an average of 60% of all FDI projects in Dubai over the past three years have an advanced technology component, classified medium to high per OECD definitions</p><h4>Dubai Plan 2021 involves the transformation of Dubai into one of the smartest and most sustainable cities in the world. What opportunities does this offer to international investors? </h4><p>Dubai Plan 2021 is a strategic framework that encompasses all aspects of living and working in Dubai with clear social, environmental, and economic goals. Many economic sectors offer great opportunities especially in trade, logistics, tourism, real estate, and financial services. In recent years, healthcare and education have grown and matured exponentially, offering lucrative returns thanks to new strategies like medical tourism and population growth, and the attraction of international students as Dubai grows its global reputation of excellence in health and education. By hosting Expo 2020, Dubai is providing another platform for business growth and expansion for both traditional and new economic sectors as we see increasing activity in the digital, startup, creative, and sharing economies, driving entrepreneurship and increasing FDI flows into research, development, and innovation.</p><h4>How do you see Dubai's international leadership in what is known as “the future industry"? </h4><p>Dubai is the most diversified and knowledge-based economy in the MENA region. This achievement wouldn't have been possible without a leadership vision of the future. Leading “the future industry" is deeply grounded in how Dubai anticipated change and shaped its own future. Today, the Dubai 10X program is at the heart of this transformation, with a clear objective to put Dubai 10 years ahead of any other city in the world. Dubai provides a rare opportunity for global business leaders, forward-thinking companies, and entrepreneurs to shape the future of cities and the way we work, live, learn, and play.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead? </h4><p>We remain positive about the outlook for FDI inflows to Dubai in the coming years, thanks to having the leadership vision and guidance to continually improve on the business environment and provide the economic incentives that enhance business sector sustainability, competitiveness, and productivity. Dubai also enjoys a high level of investor confidence and a true partnership between the public and private sectors. This partnership creates new FDI opportunities and facilitates the flow of capital, technology, knowledge, and talent into productive assets that enhance Dubai's economic sustainability and competitiveness. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did the idea for Empresas La Floresta come about?</h4><p>The holding was created three years ago. We are the first holding company approved by the government of Puerto Rico. The insurance company was opened earlier in 2010 as it takes five years to modulate. We are an overcapitalized company, and the holding belongs to a trust for the security of all the stakeholders; KPMG, the superintendence of Puerto Rico, and the trusts audits us. If we make a significant movement of money, the trust regulates it. It is a system of protection for those insured, the regulatory entity, the employees, and the country.</p><h4>How was 2017 for the company?</h4><p>2017 was a great year. It is important to look at the technical utility in the balance of the company, and last year we had a technical profit of USD3.36 million. The accounting of an insurance company is different from the accounting of a typical business. Regarding the holding, we were the first hospital in Latin America to perform robotic surgery and offer treatments against AIDS. Similarly, we were the first hospital to be cataloged as a university in live kidney transplants. We have to sell people what they need, and we find market needs through studies and analysis. Primarily, we focus on chronic diseases and low economic classes. The second saving system in the world is insurance, and here our target is the lower class.</p><h4>How have Farmagar and Clinisalud evolved?</h4><p>Farmagar became the first nationwide distributor of medicine in Venezuela. We plan to open in San Miguelito as part the company's integration is already mature and generating profits. Clinisalud is a primary attention center and has a system of preventive medicine. 85% of primary health problems are solved without hospitalization, which has been a huge success for us; chronic patients are the ones we see most of. In the clinic of La Floresta, there are no longer instances of children born with HIV.</p><h4>After many years in the sector running a holding of this caliber, what is the main challenge in Panama?</h4><p>The challenge is to grow and decide if we want to grow in rankings by net prima or profits. We may not be a huge company but we have a high profitability. Moving forward, we see major opportunities in the hospital area. We are vertically integrated with a chemist, a distributor, a hospital, a pharmacy, and a primary care center; this makes us a self-sustaining business and, therefore, strong competitors.</p><h4>Empresas La Floresta was recognized as the best holding company by Search the Elite in 2017. How was that process and what does it mean to you?</h4><p>For me, it is an honor. Cambridge reviewed the nominees and spoke to me several times. They did not promote it in Panama, even though it was supposed to conduct a conference about the world economic system.</p><h4>What are the objectives of the holding company for 2018?</h4><p>We want to grow and consolidate in Puerto Rico, Panama, and Santo Domingo. Over time, we have reinvented ourselves to adapt to difficult economic cycles. For example, we hired a large Mexican consortium that is responsible for recruiting and organizational psychology. Today in an interview, companies have to tell the future employee how far they can go in the company, what are the projected goals, and ask if they are willing to follow that path to grow together with the company. This is one of the most difficult businesses in the world, and it takes five years to mature; therefore, it is necessary to establish a solid base and excellent time management. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess Dubai Chamber's accomplishments in Latin America in the past year? </h4><p><span></span>Dubai Chamber has ramped up its activities in Latin America as part of its international expansion strategy. These efforts are aimed at increasing Dubai's trade and investment with the region and forging closer ties between the UAE and Latin American business communities. The opening of Dubai Chamber's representative offices in Brazil and Panama were major steps forward that have enabled us to strengthen our relationships with key public and private sector stakeholders, identify promising business opportunities for our members, and promote Dubai as an attractive market for Latin American companies. We plan to further expand our presence in the region with an additional office in Argentina in the near future. Over the last few years, we have signed cooperation agreements with several chambers of commerce and other government bodies with the aim of boosting our access to promising Latin American markets. We have also allocated around USD27 million to raise awareness about business opportunities in Latin America, which reflects our strong commitment to forging closer economic ties with the region. This investment supports the activities of Dubai Chamber's existing offices in Latin America and the Global Business Forum (GBF) on Latin America. GBF Latin America is our flagship event series that brings together heads of state, policymakers, top government officials, prominent CEOs, business leaders, and entrepreneurs from the UAE and Latin America to explore bilateral business opportunities. Over the last few years, the series has generated a lot of interest and achieved significant progress with regards to fostering economic cooperation between the UAE and Latin America.</p><h4>How does Dubai Chamber's new Panama office contribute to building bridges and strengthening economic relations? </h4><p>Officially inaugurated in July 2018, Dubai Chamber's Panama office is focusing its efforts on identifying business opportunities that can create mutual benefits for UAE and Panamanian businesses alike. Panama and the UAE share many synergies as both countries serve as strategic gateways to their respective regions, while they also boast highly developed logistics expertise and infrastructure. Dubai Chamber's Panama office is actively assisting companies in the country that are keen to trade with Dubai, expand their global footprint, and access markets across the GCC, Middle East, Africa, and Asia. Beyond trade facilitation, our Panama office regularly hosts and attends meetings, exhibitions, seminars, and networking events in Latin America, and works with government entities and business communities in the region in organizing trade missions and bilateral meetings.</p><h4>Why is Dubai Chamber focusing on Panama specifically, and how do you aim to build on synergies between Panama and the UAE in the future? </h4><p>As an attractive trade, logistics, and financial hub, Panama is one of the best places to do business in Latin America. The country offers a stable business-friendly environment and excellent infrastructure, in addition to attractive incentives for foreign investors. The country connects directly to 78 cities on the American continent and across the world through its sea ports located on its Pacific and Atlantic coasts, airports, and, the expanded Panama Canal. We hope that direct flights between Dubai and Panama will become a reality in the future as this would be a major factor that would enhance business relations between the two sides. Other measures, such as the easing of visa restrictions for citizens travelling between the UAE and Panama and additional strategic agreements facilitating cooperation in new sectors and areas would also help build bridges between business communities. One of our main objectives is increasing Dubai's non-oil trade with Panama, which amounted to nearly USD21 million in 2017, and expanding the scope of trade and investment to new high-potential sectors and product categories.</p><h4>What are the key sectors for  the growth of bilateral trade and investment between Panama and Dubai? </h4><p>There is huge potential to expand trade and investment ties in key economic areas such as manufacturing, finance, logistics, and tourism. Panama can serve as a strategic gateway for UAE businesses to access the Latin America region. The recent expansion of the Panama Canal has made trade with Latin America much more efficient. Panama's robust economy is among the fastest-growing in Latin America, and its prospects for the future look promising.  The country is home to a rising middle class with growing spending power, which is creating plenty of new business opportunities in the areas of fintech, financial services, real estate, data, free zones, port infrastructure, logistics, dry docks, and infrastructure projects, which UAE companies can capitalize on. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the company evolved over its 50-year history in Panama, and what have been some of its achievements?</h4><p><span></span>It has not been easy; however, hard work pays off. For example, we established a factory that produces butter processed cheese, currently the leading cheese brand in Panama. Previously, the butter was imported directly and had to be stored, transported, and refrigerated. This raised costs significantly, but over time our Australian partners found a way to store it in a 55-gallon tank that did not require refrigeration. When exported, it does not need refrigeration, and when it reaches Panama, we just need to add water. We entered that business several years ago and have done extremely well; to date, no one else is doing this; we produce and export butter for everyone else. Before we adopted the non-refrigeration way, producing butter resulted in a lot of taxes, around USD0.10 per pound. At the same time, we chose not to raise prices because of a potential decline in sales. We have been able to surpass Nestlé and are currently number one in terms of cheese sales across Panama.</p><h4>Tzanetatos works with several segments such as food, personal care, cosmetics, household, and automotive. What is the company's core activity?</h4><p>We started in the food segment but over time we have ventured into other areas such as real estate development. We have constructed several buildings, including a commercial mall in Colón and a 40-storey apartment building in Costa del Este with two 400-sqm apartments per floor. The company still owns 10% of the mall in Colón with prominent developers as minority partners. As developers, we have seen an increase in demand for small 70-sqm apartments in buildings with shopping centers on the ground floors and apartments on the upper floors. We have 3ha of land available and want to build two buildings with a green zone in the middle along with various facilities such as restaurants and pedestrian areas. </p><h4>How has Tzanetatos contributed to Panama's socioeconomic development?</h4><p>Tzanetatos Group's contribution can be summarized in its primary belief in making a better society for all. For example, I purchased a house with 20 rooms, 42 beds, and a small chapel so that mothers from outside the city who bring their children to the children's hospital have a place to sleep. Also, we developed a blood bank for a hospital. With the same purpose in mind, we built a school called Instituto Atenea for Panamanian students; those who completed seventh grade are sent to Athens, where the group owns a hotel. On top of providing accommodation, we also help the students with flight tickets. Another such contribution is our collaboration with Irma Lourdes, a hospital that is spread across 30,000sqm.</p><h4>What are your goals and priorities for 2018?</h4><p>We pay a great deal of attention to the developments surrounding the next year's general election. Entrepreneurs and companies must play their roles in social responsibility. To that end, I have purchased a 3,000-sqm plot for a project with commercial premises on the ground floor and an amusement area for young people on the upper floor. The project is based in Chorrillo, a low-income area stricken by crime. The plan also includes a dining room for up to 50 children who will be supported with rental income for life. Those with the ability and resources have to create opportunities for a better living in order to have better citizens who will strive toward a more prosperous Panama. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What would you highlight as main initiatives over the past year?</h4><p><span></span>Panama is growing at higher levels compared to other countries in Latin America. Having growth rate above 5% is great, though there are still challenges in order to ensure this growth is more inclusive in terms of other sectors and different regions within Panama. Economic growth in 2017 was mainly because of logistics, transport, and the Panama Canal, while sectors such as construction, commerce and retail, and others are not that well prepared for the slowing economy. In terms of most of the population being largely employed in retail and agriculture, the slowdown of the economy was noticeable in 2017 and carried on into 2018. We are still in the process of adjusting to this slower pace of growth. At the same time, there are also many opportunities with China. We have always maintained that Panama requires a clear vision of what it needs in the short and medium term so that we can negotiate with China in terms of a win-win situation.</p><h4>How is APEDE working to increase coordination between the private and public sectors for social and economic stability?</h4><p>Panama is betting on increased coordination between the two sectors as a way of communicating amongst all the stakeholders or constituents of Panama. Since 2014, APEDE has prepared and presented a Country Vision, presenting a set of documents as a road map to highlight and focus not only on the short term but also on Panama's strategic planning. At present, the association is working to expand this vision, with the revision from 2025 to 2050. That vision cannot just come from APEDE or the private sector; it needs to include workers, the academia, and politicians. For example, we are getting information that also plays an important role in the National Competitiveness Center (CNC). As President of APEDE, I am also President of the CNC, so we have opportunities to work together and establish a united vision.</p><h4>What are the main advantages of investing in Panama?</h4><p>The biggest advantages are Panama's USD-backed macroeconomic stability, investment rate, and financial infrastructure in the sense that credit can be obtained in a more competitive way compared to other regional countries. Also, we have certain regulations like the SEM law that provides benefits, so it makes sense for a company's regional headquarters to be located here. Moreover, Panamanians have an open mindset so foreigners do not feel like strangers here. However, we still need to provide more advantages to entice companies to move their businesses here. Tourism is important; the country still relies significantly on tourism, and we need to work as hard as our neighbor Costa Rica to get to the top. We are still in the process of getting our marketing together in order to have a clear branding of Panama. Our challenge as a country is to have initiatives like logistics and tourism in terms of the country branding to boost continuity and consistency over a period of five years. People can then identify with a stable campaign and a stable way of doing business.</p><h4>What advice would you give to the next President of APEDE?</h4><p>We have to raise the standards every year in order to remain a beacon in terms of what we can provide as an organization to the country and society as a whole. APEDE is driven by principles of liberty, democracy, ethics, and education, therefore, we need to contribute to build a better society based on these aforementioned principles and convert them into concrete actions, changes in public policies, and inquiries to government for transparency and accountability. At the end, what remains is a great satisfaction from contributing to a better country with stronger institutions, specifically by being part of the change rather than being a mere spectator. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[thinking-ahead]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the role that the Chamber takes to support the business environment in Panama?</h4><p>The UK is one of the top four investing countries in Panama. The Chamber provides British companies with contacts and advice as to where to seek the information required regarding feasible investments in Panama. In addition, we help Panamanian companies who seek assistance and information on opportunities in the UK. Importantly, a prospective member of the Chamber doesn't need to speak English, be British, or have a link with the UK; the Chamber is a multi-lingual organization. A large part of our activities is helping peer-to-peer connections between our members through our various activities. Moreover, we provide the Panamanian government with feedback regarding concerns of our members. </p><h4>What are the main factors that make Panama attractive for British investors?</h4><p>We seek to build on our established presence in Panama. The Chamber is increasing its focus on SMEs because they need greater assistance as compared to big firms. In a nutshell, we are complimenting the activities and growth of the UK Embassy, which has long established a formidable trade presence in Panama; we are well placed to explain what Panama has to offer from a businessman's perspective. The fact that Panama's economy is based on the dollar is a great advantage because the majority of investors, especially those seeking to open new businesses, have concerns regarding local currencies in Latin American markets. The region presents investors with huge opportunities; however, currency fluctuations and instability have caused investors to shy away from the region expect for Panama. On top of this, the Panamanian market is well placed from a logistics hub perspective as connectivity is important to prospective investors. One initiative that would further boost the interest of British investors is a direct flight from Panama to the UK; the Chamber is working with the government to overcome this hurdle. </p><h4>Where can reforms be implemented to facilitate the country's economic growth?</h4><p>First and foremost, education is of prime importance if Panama is to continue along its already formidable growth path. The Chamber will increase efforts to help companies with improving English language standards as well as the general quality of education in the country. Since English is the language of business and higher education, improving the education system should be the number one target. Equally important is to maintain the rule of law; the lack of the rule of law is highly criticized by the local population and prospective investors. Consequently, the Chamber will closely follow the future progress and intentions of the government, especially changes in the Constitution.<br></p><h4>What incentives do you offer members and what is your strategy to attract new ones?</h4><p>The Chamber holds different weekly activities including the now famous Ascot Races, Golf Day, and Annual Business Forum. In addition to regular lunches with guest speakers, we have social evenings where members can get to socialize and exchange ideas. Our members also enjoy a wide selection of discounts at various establishments in Panama. We also work with other British organizations such as the Anglo Panama Cultural Association, British Aid group, Caravana, and the Annual British Ball. Since the Chamber is a non-profit organization, it supports various charities, especially those focused on education. </p><h4>What is your main goal for 2018?</h4><p>In 2018, the Chamber will continue building on the hard work undertaken by our predecessors. In particular, we want to see increased recruitment of younger members who will set up their own boards and activities; it is vital to ensure that the Chamber stays relevant to the younger business community. Finally, we are planning activities for women under their own executive in order to appeal to a larger part of the community. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As President of the Chamber of Commerce, Industries, and Agriculture, how would you evaluate the Panamanian economy over the last 10 years?</h4><p><span></span>Panama's economy has been growing steadily over the past 10 years. From 2010-2013, the country experienced double-digit growth, and from 2015 onward it has been growing between 5% and 5.5% per annum. The external facing economy, which includes the aviation industry, ports, Panama Canal, and logistics sector, has been driving the country's growth. Meanwhile, the internal economy has been performing at a slower rate than expected. This includes the automotive, hotel, and retail industries, which have been shrinking over the last few years. Similarly, the construction and real estate sectors have been growing at a slower rate. Based on the figures provided by the chamber's economic center, the economy is expected to grow around 5.4% in 2018. The country has the potential to grow 6.5% and we are predicting to reach that figure by 2020. </p><h4>Has the election played a strong role in the downturn of the economy?</h4><p>We are currently in the pre-election year. Candidates will have less time to campaign for both the primaries and the national election because the electoral code has changed. This means there will be less money circulating in the economy. In addition, business people typically hold off on making investments in projects during an election period. Therefore, we will witness a slowdown in the economy through YE2018. </p><h4>What are your main initiatives and goals for 2018?</h4><p>We are mainly focused on three pillars: tourism, education, and logistics. The chamber has a few tourism projects in the pipeline. The first is the establishment of the Tourism Investment Fund in August 2018. Its first task is to take over Panama's international advertising campaign. At present, Panama's Tourism Authority has a contract with an American advertising company that will expire in October 2018. Second, the convention center is being built in Amador, set to finish by YE2018; we are pushing the government, not only to finish the construction, but also to start advertising the center to attract new companies to Panama. Our second pillar is education. The government is currently completing a technical institute that will prepare Panamanians for what could be 60% of new jobs created in the country over the coming years. In terms of logistics, Panama has been promoting itself as a regional hub with immense potential. Notably, after a successful free trade agreement with China, logistics will take on an even greater role in Panama's economy. The country already boasts a reputation as the "Hub of the Americas" with Tocumen International Airport, as one of the most efficient airports in the region, along with the Panama Canal, the country's most important asset. The ports and container movements through the Panama Canal alone account for more than USD2.5 billion every year.</p><h4>Which sectors are currently the most profitable for potential investors in Panama?</h4><p>The greatest opportunities for investment in Panama are in tourism, logistics, and green energy.</p><h4>What training programs does the Chamber have specifically for women, who make up one-third of its members?</h4><p>The chamber has undertaken several initiatives to train and give back to its female members. Women make up an important part of our environment and membership, and for the past few years we have been working on facilitating them more. The chamber's more than 1,700 women members are offered networking opportunities, training, and information. </p><h4>What reforms need to be implemented in the short to medium term to facilitate Panama's social and economic growth?</h4><p>The construction sector is bureaucratic here. We have been working on a high level joint government and private sector commission where we have evaluated 100 government processes and reduced them by about 20% while increasing efficiency. On the regulatory side, we promote reforms to the constitution that are mainly focused on the administration of justice. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[forging-a-robust-economy]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your main priorities and vision for the ministry for 2018? </h4><p><span></span>We have set a number of priorities for 2018. We are in the midst of negotiating an FTA with China, and it is our main priority given the footprint of China's economy on the global stage. Panama-China relations alone give us a fairly full plate in terms of actions for the year. In addition, Panama is always keen to attract foreign investments, and we are continuing our efforts to lead Central America in terms of FDI. We have certain legislative initiatives and recently submitted a policy change to the cabinet aimed at making the multinational headquarters law more competitive while adapting it to OECD's latest international standards. We are also focusing on improving exports; they have been sliding over the last few years; however, we were able to reverse the trend in 2017, recording growth of around 5%. In 2018, we are up around 11% on our exports, illustrating that our initiatives are producing significant results. Equally important, we have important projects aimed at improving the tourism industry; we are aware that tourism will play a major role in ensuring Panama's long-term economic wellbeing. To make this happen, we need to improve not only the natural and cultural infrastructure, but also take initiatives like Colón international shopping centers. Colón plays an important role in the government's plans, investing over USD1.7 billion through a project called Renovación Urbana, Integración Humana (Urban Renovation, Human Integration), in areas such as infrastructure, housing, sport facilities, schools, and others. It is joined with another program called Colón Puerto Libre (Colón Free Port), that grants aggressive incentives for the private sector to invest in Colón, and for consumers, tourists, or Panamanians that buy certain goods.</p><h4>What are your expectations for FDI in 2018? </h4><p>FDI is a cornerstone of our economic activity, representing almost 10% of GDP. By being able to attract FDI, Panama is able to provide growth, employment, knowledge transfers, and higher quality of life. The numbers speak for themselves; almost 50% of the FDI in Central America comes to Panama. Of the FDI that we are able to attract, almost 50% is in the form of local reinvestment in earnings, which tells us that companies trust Panama and are willing to expand and diversify their footprint. Panama is an ideal hub for distribution and R&amp;D, and many companies end up adding more global business services and activities to their operations in Panama. </p><h4>What are the main highlights of the FTA between Panama and China, and what can Panama expect in the coming years? </h4><p>We are working closely with the private sector as we negotiate this FTA in order to proceed with maximum transparency and maximize our opportunities. Simultaneously, we are organizing trade visits and will have a large trade delegation in November. The CIIE conference in Shanghai is the perfect window to connect exporters in Panama with importers and distributors across China. We are looking at the relationship from many angles and want to ensure that potential Chinese investment abides by clear rules in order to generate real, industrial economic growth and diversification. We approach the trade agreement as a holistic exercise that can inject sustainable investment into Panama and allow local companies to thrive.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on the main initiatives taken to modernize the industrial sector in Panama? </h4><p>To trigger this change, we needed to come up with a new, forward-looking industrial law. After several discussions, we developed a piece of legislation that provides aggressive incentives to modernize the industrial sector, foster competitiveness, and increase productive capacity. We have expanded on the law's details, so the framework is in place. Now, it is about making sure that investors know how the industrial sector can work for foreign and national companies. We also have to automate the way companies access these incentives, and we are hopeful that this process will be completed by the end of 2018. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate the work and initiatives launched by the ministry thus far?</h4><p><span></span>Today, Panama has an active and proactive role in the global agenda, with clear leadership in the Development Agenda. This is recognized by the international community and international organizations. The experience of Panamanians such as Natalia Kanem, Esmeralda de Troitiño, and Laura Florespara occupying positions of leadership in the UN and the IACHR have been recognized, and Panama was selected to chair committees and conferences of the International Labor Organization, International Organization for Migration, Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, Inter-American Committee against Terrorism, and Association of Caribbean States, among others. Panama has for the first time formed a national cooperation plan, Panama Coopera, which attracts and focuses on the country's priorities, and has made official the incursion of Panama as a cooperating country. It also incorporates a new strategy of cultural diplomacy that promotes Panamanian cinema, gastronomy, and music through the foreign service. This government has strengthened its relationship with Latin America and made historic approaches with countries from other regions with which we did not have such a close relationship, seeking to diversify and increase opportunities for the country. A great example is the establishment of diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China, a step that will benefit Panama diplomatically, economically, socially, and commercially. The strengthening of institutions and the modernization of processes have been key pillars of our management and one of the main legacies of this administration. All services for citizens have been automated, from the procedures of authentications and legalizations, to privileges and diplomatic immunities, consular services, and internal procedures for the acquisition of goods and services.</p><h4>What are the main advantages of diplomatic relations with China, and what can Panama expect in the coming years?</h4><p>After concluding a feasibility study with positive results, Panama and China officially launched negotiations for a trade agreement during a formal ceremony held in Beijing. With such an agreement, Panama will strengthen its commercial relationship with the second-largest economy in the world, boosting its logistics platform and consolidating Panama as a center of operations with added value for large Chinese technology companies. In addition, the trade agreement would boost Panamanian exports to the Asian market, with great potential for agricultural, fishing, and agro-industrial products, which would have better access to this market with preferential treatment. Likewise, we aim to make the trade agreement an important catalyst for continuous sustainable development, as well as diversification, competitiveness, and scope of exportable service sectors. One of the main findings of the feasibility study is that Panama and China have complementary economies. Therefore, in terms of prospects, we are confident the trade agreement will increase Panamanian exports to China, a country that currently ranks third as the destination of Panamanian exports, worth more than USD42 million in 2017.</p><h4>What are the priorities for next year?</h4><p>Regarding foreign policy, strengthening the bilateral agenda with China is a priority. The relation is already supported by 25 bilateral agreements. In 2018, we will also carry out high-level visits to key countries and receive high authorities from several nations under our new Falcon Policy; we are working on opening embassies in Australia, Africa, and the Middle East. Panama will host World Youth Day, an important showcase of our country to the world. Finally, it is an extremely important year for the consolidation of the processes of modernization and institutional strengthening. We will hold the fifth and sixth entry contest for the diplomatic and consular career. It is a priority for this administration to have a competitive diplomatic branch—one that is represented by the best professionals. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>On a day like today four years ago I took office as President of the Republic at the Rommel Fernández Stadium, a place that unites Panamanians. Defining these four years of management in a word is extremely easy: peace. We have had peace to carry out the necessary tasks and to lead this country through paths of progress and honesty. Without social peace, there is no investment, prosperity, economic growth, or new jobs. With my head held high, I can tell the country that we have fulfilled our commitment to change the policy of a business to a public service. Today, it is evident that nobody is above the law. No cases of corruption have been hidden and those that have been reported are being investigated. Together we are building a functional democracy where the separation of powers is respected.</p><p><span></span>In this fight against corruption, we recovered more than PAB500 million, PAB390 million by judicial means to date, and savings of more than PAB250 million due to transparency in public procurement. The recovery of these funds has allowed us to meet a debt of 40 years with workers through the CEPADEM, benefiting more than 600,000 people who are returning to them a figure that exceeds PAB350 million. We have accomplished changing the lives of millions of Panamanians.</p><p><span></span>At present, 355km of new roads have been built throughout the country and over 2,000km of roads are set to be built by the end of our administration, an investment that exceeds PAB2 billion. We have allocated over PAB144 million to support agricultural producers. I committed myself to seek equity in education, so that all Panamanian children have the opportunity to receive bilingual education in schools with modern infrastructure. We are moving forward with a firm step to a bilingual public education system. The construction of the first higher technical institute has an advance of more than 48%; the professors train in gastronomy, hospitality, and tourism in France; in the automotive area in Germany; and in business, construction, and logistics in Canada. We are investing more than PAB1 billion in new educational centers and improvement of facilities throughout the national territory. To fulfill our promise of potable water we are expanding the water treatment plants of Chilibre and Sabanitas; building new Gamboa and Howard water treatment plants. In terms of health, we are building the sewerage systems of Santiago, David, Changuinola, Boquete, and Isla Colón and expanding the wastewater treatment plant of Juan Dí­az. We built the first plant of this type for the west sector, in Burunga, Arraiján. These projects represent an investment of PAB1.5 billion.</p><p><span></span>By December 2018, we will complete the renovation of the National Theater and begin the 2019 theater season; we will deliver the works of the Metropolitan Cathedral and the governance of Colón, where we will witness the parade on November 5. We will continue improving the public transport system, increasing the frequency and quantity of buses, offering a more efficient and integrated service; today, we transport some 600,000 people in the Metrobus, 150,000 more than last year.</p><p><span></span>Despite the complicated situations that we have lived, fighting against corruption and the attack on our legal and financial services, we have been able to maintain an average growth of 5.2%, unemployment of 5.9%, and inflation below 1%. In these four years, 150,818 Panamanians have come out of poverty. The establishment of diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China has allowed the arrival of a direct flight from Air China and we have begun the feasibility studies of the Panama-David train. The launching of the Falcon Policy towards the Middle East and Asia Pacific and the re-launching of the relations with other powers will bring us a new era in commercial, cultural and cooperation exchange. </p><p><span></span>My government has not been perfect, but I have worked with honesty and good intentions. May God bless Panama and accompany us in this election year to continue working always united for the future of this beautiful nation. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have relations between the UAE and Panama evolved since you took office in 2014?</h4><p>As soon as I won the election, I decided to establish an embassy in the UAE in order to expand our diplomatic footprint. Since then, we sent an ambassador and have exchanged a number of missions. The Dubai Chamber of Commerce came to Panama and wants to open an office. Additionally, we plan on bringing a business delegation to the UAE and have confirmed that Panama will participate in Expo 2020. We are signing different agreements aimed at protecting investment and supporting tourism between our countries. Going forward, the main challenge we face is ensuring that we add value to all of the cargo that comes through the canal. This would not only ensure Panama's position as a shipping and logistics hub, but would also allow firms and countries to maximize their industrial and economic potential. </p><h4>What strategic priorities and areas of cooperation between Panama and the UAE are moving forward?</h4><p>Trade is a vital component of relations between Panama and Dubai and can be further leveraged to support both nations. If we are able to establish a direct flight, trade could expand a great deal. Panama and the UAE both represent international success stories; both are global hubs with air connectivity and financial centers that play an important role in the global economy. Each place is also a gateway to their respective regions: the UAE for the Middle East, India, and Africa, and Panama for Central and Latin America, with the canal the most modern and visible symbol of our ability to connect the world. Moreover, our airport serves 15 million passengers and has 15,000 employees, which we seek to grow to 30-45,000 in the coming years. In terms of investment, we are trying to invite the UAE's investment fund to bring capital into Panama, vitalizing sectors like energy, infrastructure, and real estate.</p><h4>What are the biggest lessons Panama can learn from the UAE?</h4><p>The UAE is a country that promotes peace, dialog, tolerance, and investment protection and, as such, has a great future ahead. A key area we can learn from is immigration. Changing regulations to drive immigration would be vital, including visa requirements, so that we can support expanded tourism. The UAE is a country with a beautiful soul that makes a great effort to ensure that the people who are building it are happy and taken care of. In Panama, we changed from restricted visas to stamp visas, and I hope that one day we can open the country entirely, doing away with visas. This is, of course, a process that takes time. From a business point of view, immigration reform would facilitate a smooth transition for international SMEs looking to enter the country and bring their expertise. By having nationals from more than 150 countries working together in the Emirates, it sends a strong message to countries that are currently closing their borders and restricting access. You cannot define people by their country of origin, and the UAE is doing an excellent job illustrating this.</p><h4>What would be your message for UAE investors interested in Panama?</h4><p>Panama's FDI has grown by more than USD4.5 billion every year in recent years, coming from Asia, the US, Europe, and the Middle East. Thanks to our robust regulatory system, investing in our country is very secure, profitable, and safe. In this sense, we have directed more than USD500 million in the fight against corruption. Panama's USD65 billion GDP has been growing steadily for the past 10 years, averaging 6-7% growth per year. Unemployment is less than 5%, and inflation is less than 1%. Like the UAE, we have benefited from the growing presence of international companies that are using our geographic position. As proof of our extremely business-friendly environment, 150 international companies from all industries and service specialties have moved their headquarters to Panama. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[A Strategic Relationship]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[erwin-kroell-senior-vice-president-omv-middle-east-africa]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you walk through the strategic relationship between OMV and Abu Dhabi and the steps that led to the USD1.5 billion purchase of the 20% interest in the concession of the Satah Al Razboot and Umm Lulu offshore fields?</h4><p>The relationship between Abu Dhabi and OMV goes back to 1994, when IPIC (now Mubadala Investment Company) acquired a 19.6% of OMV shares, which today is up to 24.9%, making it the second-largest shareholder after the Austrian State. This was the start of a relationship that has improved and intensified over time, both in the upstream, where in 2018 we announced the signing of important offshore concessions, and downstream, where OMV owns 36% of polyolefin producer Borealis, a joint venture with Mubadala, which holds the remaining 64%. In the upstream segment, our close cooperation with Abu Dhabi, through IPIC, has grown from being an investment of the Emirate's fund to actually doing business in the Emirate itself. As such, in 2007 we opened the first representative office and started to engage with ADNOC to determine how and where we could cooperate. After some years of engagement and discussion, we entered into the first Technical Evaluation Agreement for the appraisal and potential development of the Shuwaihat gas/condensate field together with Wintershall. The following year, we signed a second agreement for an exploration evaluation in the Al Ain area; in 2016 we did a third Technical Evaluation Agreement covering the Northwest Offshore region of Abu Dhabi, where together with Occidental we worked on the appraisal and development concept for sour gas out of a number of undeveloped gas, gas/condensate, and oil fields including Ghasha and Hail. A major step was the agreement signed on April 29, 2018, when OMV became a 20% shareholder of ADNOC's offshore concession Umm Lulu, SARB, Bin Nasher, and Al Bateel. The concession fits perfectly into the OMV Upstream strategy identifying the Middle East &amp; Africa as a priority region for our business, and its 40-year duration demonstrates our commitment to a long-term sustainable growth strategy together with ADNOC.</p><h4>What is your perspective on ADNOC's transformation and what are the implications of its new partnership model for IOCs such as OMV? </h4><p>ADNOC is not the only national oil company (NOC) undergoing this process of transformation, as the developments of the energy industry are asking for both IOCs and NOCs to adapt and work more closely to apply the right technologies for creating increasingly complex oil and gas reservoir systems. This more direct approach can also be seen through its partnership model: ADNOC and other NOCs are forming strategic partnerships with their oil and gas off-takers, such as China, India, Korea, and Japan to secure access to those respective markets. Given these dynamics, it becomes increasingly important for an IOC such as OMV to both gain extensive knowledge of a market before entering it and carry out joint studies with potential NOCs it might partner with. What OMV has achieved together with ADNOC in the UAE is similar to what has been done with NOC in Libya, where we formed a successful strategic partnership many years ago. It is part of the business development cycle: before a player truly commits to investing in a certain asset or a certain country, it should first and foremost build relationships with its potential host NOC.</p><h4>Where does Abu Dhabi still offer significant opportunities in the upstream segment?</h4><p>Today, there is no more oil or gas that can be extracted easily, and while there is still exploration potential, it is most likely not to the extent of finding discoveries such as those made in the past decades. In Abu Dhabi, the major opportunity, which is also a challenge, consists of developing the more complex offshore sour gas in rather tight formations. Demand for gas both in the UAE and the entire region is very high and only applying advanced and fit-for-purpose technologies will help securing gas supply. It is thus clear that in the foreseeable future gas will play a major role in the energy mix of the UAE.</p><h4>How do you expect the energy mix to evolve in the medium term, and what should the energy industry place particular attention to with regards to this evolution?</h4><p>With the growth of global population, each country will have to meet the respective growth in energy demand through a diversified, more localized energy mix, whether it is through hydrocarbons—predominantly gas—coal, hydro, solar, wind, and nuclear. As such, attention should be devoted to how the change in the use of hydrocarbons and the progress in energy efficiency will impact economies. Today, for example, transportation accounts for the majority of oil usage: this will change, as the finite resource oil will be used more in the petrochemicals segment. On the gas side, a great deal of gas is burned for electricity, water desalination, or major industrial projects: this will also change, and we are likely to see a more diverse set of energy sources used for one asset. At the same time, there is a huge untapped potential in using energy more efficiently. Hydrogen will be important in the future energy mix to drive transportation. Another example is offered by using desalinated water more consciously since desalination of seawater is very energy intensive.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the value of your relationships with international institutions, and what do you look for in these partnerships?</h4><p>Some of these partnerships are for accreditation purposes. We are a member of the Middle State Commission for Higher Education and being a member of the association allows us to participate in the decisions of the accreditation criteria. Through the association we are developing best practices in governance and institutional policies. Some other collaborations are there for program development and research objectives. For example, we have been running a program where we invite scholars from world-renowned universities to come and teach at Zayed University. We also bring people to advise on improvements to our institution, particularly when it comes to English instruction and the English skills of students. This reflects our aim of always looking for aspects that improve the environment for all students. Finally, we also have a number of research collaborations with institutions around the world.</p><h4>Are there any specific areas of research that you are aiming to be more involved in?</h4><p>As a comprehensive university, we have research strengths in multiple areas; IT security and data analytics, environment and public health, accounting and other business fields, social sciences, and innovations in education and other fields. As we have these expertise, we look for partners who share similar specializations. We have around 250 research projects annually in these fields and around two-third of these are in collaboration with international research partners. Also, there are a number of contract research projects funded by government agencies for specific objectives.</p><h4>How do you assess students' ability to adapt to all these new technologies and programs?</h4><p>Our students are the first adopters of technology, which makes the integration of innovative approaches natural. To further this, we are creating an innovation and entrepreneurship center at the university to coordinate developing the business enterprise culture in partnership with business incubators and accelerators, and national organizations developing the SME sector. The university has a FAB-LAB that was just established at the College of Arts and Creative Enterprises, where we combine IT skills development with design courses and fabrication facilities. The Fab-Lab is an interesting concept because it has 3D printing capabilities for small items, and for bigger items the lab contains an eight-axis robotic arm can fabricate these using subtraction technology. By programming this robot, our students can take images and then fabricate these images thereby carry out reverse engineering. This opens a lot of possibilities for students, who are eager and capable of adopting new solutions.</p><h4>How does Zayed University contribute to the further economic diversification and Emiratization of the UAE?</h4><p>About 55% of our graduates get jobs in the first year, and about 70% get jobs in the two to three years after graduation. The remainder go to graduate schools or work within their families' businesses or simply prioritize family. Our graduates are well articulated, and have gone on to work across all sectors of the economy and in government. A great example is the current Minister of Community Development, HE Hessa Bint Essa Buhumaid, who is an alumnus of our university.</p><h4>How do you go about fostering leadership when designing your programs?</h4><p>The learning outcomes of Zayed University are based on a core comprising the skills to be learned by all and are modeled after the twenty first century skills. They include critical thinking, communications skills, leadership skills including the roles within teams, technological awareness, and relevant IT tools. We use a lot of role-playing, which fosters the ability to interact with a team well and contribute. We also have student councils for each campus, student clubs, and training programs. We believe that students learn though experiences thus the quality of the learning experience is important. Thus, we encourage students to apply their skills in classroom projects and in the wider community, through volunteerism and other activities outside the campus. Additionally, people from the community are often engaged to deliver workshops on campus. By sharing their expertise with the campus, students then get a mixture of experiences.</p><h4>How do you promote the development of original research and entrepreneurship?</h4><p>We have been running an undergraduate research program where a select number of students are mentored by faculty members for 2-2.5 years, after which they are expected to produce an original piece of research. Upon successful completion, we reward them by supporting their participation at local and international conferences to present their findings. Students completing this program are well prepared for graduate school, as they have acquired important research skills. We are going to start a new program in entrepreneurship along similar line in which a cohort will be recruited to engage in a co-educational program to develop their enterprise skills. This program will be complement a mandatory course for all students in the freshman year on entrepreneurship skills, whose faculty have received training at Stanford University as part of a Ministry of education initiative for public schools in the UAE. And will also complement upper level courses now offered in which students develop business plans within their majors, such as IT, Design, Communications, etc.</p><h4>What is on the agenda for 2018?</h4><p>The university will complete its first round of national program accreditation in 2018. This is a major milestone which will add to its institutional accreditation, and international accreditation by US-based program accreditation bodies. It is noteworthy that Zayed University, as a public university, was not required to undergo national accreditation until recently, thus it obtained its international accreditation before the national accreditation. We look forward by end of 2018 to the start of construction of the new male student campus in Dubai, which will allow the university to offer new programs. This expansion will cater for male students as well as have shared labs for STEM programs and an expanded sports facility. As every year, we will have a seminar speaking about the legacy of Sheikh Zayed, but for 2018 it will take on added significance considering it will be the Year of Zayed. His legacy is about being active in all aspects of life, being considerate, mindful, and tolerant. The University in 2018 will establish an innovation &amp; Entrepreneurship center. Every February we participate in the national innovation month, where activities starting in Abu Dhabi during the first week, go through the other Emirates, and end in Dubai during the final week. During this month, we will have a lot of activities both on our campuses in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, and out in the communities. We are showcasing a lot of innovations that have been developed by Zayed University, including quality assurance, smart services, and a platform for online courses. Through the Innovation &amp; Entrepreneurship center, students will have the opportunity to develop their ideas into viable business ventures.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you reconcile your modern vision of the Phoenicia with its storied past?</h4><p><span></span>Since its opening in 1961, the Phoenicia has been recognized as an elite destination, with 446 luxurious rooms and suites, wide choice of restaurants, shops, and two swimming pools. Kings, queens, world leaders, celebrities, businessmen, and the jet-set alike have all made Phoenicia Hotel their home away from home and played a pivotal role in the country's golden age of the 1960s and early 1970s. After years of closure due to Lebanon's tragic war, Mazen and Marwan Salha, Chairman and Member of the Board of Directors of “La Société des Grands Hotels du Liban" respectively, decided to rebuild Beirut's “Grand Dame" of hospitality. Much like a Phoenix rising from the ashes, the hotel reopened its doors in March 2000. Phoenicia Hotel is a symbol of Beirut and its place in the hospitality scene is so ingrained that the decision to reopen it was a natural one. Since reopening in 2000 it has undergone a series of improvements led by internationally renowned designers, such as Martin Hulbert of Fox Linton, Inge Moore, and Summer Williams. Their aim was to evolve the design characteristics of the Phoenicia into a more modern approach while maintaining its cultural and artistic heritage. With each transformation, new opportunities take shape. The Phoenicia Hotel continues to make history, and to assure its place as Lebanon's foremost hotel.</p><h4>What have been some key developments for the company in 2017?</h4><p>We have had a busy year with plenty of new initiatives from certain segments in the economy. In particular, we are placing a focus on organizing more familiarization trips for MICE bookers. We can definitely say that Lebanon is back on the map as a hub for regional congresses and conferences. We are also witnessing greater demand from the Latin American market, particularly Brazil, and from Australia. The fact that there are now more direct flights from European countries is another factor that is helping to increase demand. Among the trends that have stood out has been the return of high-end travelers, and also of clientele from the GCC region. The positive outlook during the year contributed to visits from high level political delegations, which we were proud to host. During the year other notable developments for the hotel included the addition of new retail openings, allowing for an enhanced retail experience for guests.</p><h4>What are some key challenges that are present in the Lebanese market?</h4><p>The general climate of the country has an impact on the hotel's wellbeing. Political and security concerns can impact the hotel as a business, but the past year has been positive and we are booming again. Security is the most important factor here so it was essential for us to allay people's fears. The measures we took then and continue to take to assure security proved that we are indeed safe; we use challenging times to reinforce our positive outlook. For example, when a crisis hit Lebanon's apple farmers and impacted their ability to export, we made a conscious decision to support them by offering free apples to our clientele. Such small actions have the power to spread positivity in the face of adversity.</p><h4>What are some of the upcoming projects with huge potential?</h4><p>We are developing a lot of different projects in terms of culinary expertise, art, and CSR. We have an extensive art collection throughout the hotel and we continuously initiate creative projects to promote local talent, such as the Phoenicia Hotel Art Photo competition. We are working on a lot of culinary initiatives such as a culinary institute and an academy. We are also fully committed to improving the hotel's CSR, ESS, and employee engagement through team-bonding activities and workshops spreading positivity and empowerment. We believe the hotel's strongest asset is its people; we are driven by a human approach and want to deliver a genuine and true experience to all of our guests. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Conceptualizing Community Malls]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[conceptualizing-community-malls]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What strategy are you currently implementing at ABC Group, and how does it differ from the company's previous operations?</h4><p><span></span>The last year and a half has been extremely intense. First, we built new offices; we did not want a modern building in particular, but more of a traditional Lebanese building with a modern interior. ABC is a Lebanese company and we wanted this to be reflected. We then worked on setting up a state-of-the-art logistics network and boosting our new retail concept with the renovation of Achrafieh. Shifting from a family-owned business to a corporation is easy; at first, people did not fully understand the benefits, though this has gradually changed.</p><h4>How does your new retail concept differ from before?</h4><p><span></span>In our new concept, the central flooring of the department store is in a Lebanese style, with copper and natural stone, and we have increased the feeling of openness and done away with walls. The retail concept that we rolled out in Verdun followed the same trajectory as Achrafieh. The opening of the Verdun department store, as well as the mall, were two extremely important milestones in the company's history. The entire project was rolled out in an incredible way; we built 150,000sqm in three years and delivered the project six months ahead of time and 20% under the initial budget. Our malls are community malls where people already live, and we insert ourselves into a society and reflect their aspirations. When it comes to business, ABC's vision is to make Lebanon a better place, positively impacting the community that we work with. </p><h4><span></span>How is e-commerce influencing the retail sector in Lebanon, and how are companies like ABC Group dealing with it?</h4><p><span></span>There is a big myth surrounding e-commerce that it kills malls. However, when we talk about retail entertainment, customers interact with malls in different ways; many people go to ABC not only to shop, but also to buy a newspaper or eat, among other things. Selfridges and Harrods will continue to exist because as long as one offers an experience, it will always surpass what is offered online. Nevertheless, we are continuously working on making our customer experience more seamless and pleasant, and we will continue to offer things that correspond to people's dreams. ABC is working on an e-commerce project that will likely be rolled out in 1Q2019. We value e-commerce and it is important; however, at the same time we should not overdo it. It should be a complementary service to our existing portfolio.</p><h4>To what extent has consumer purchasing power fallen due to the current economic situation?</h4><p>According to Lebanese Franchise Association (LFA), the purchase of luxury goods has fallen by 50% since 2012. Spending on fashion and accessories declined by 30%, meaning the overall cake has shrunk. For luxury, the biggest impact was the lack of influx of large spenders from the GCC. We have continued to advance, especially with Verdun, and currently see double-digit growth. We need to continue to offer a unique journey to our customers and make it an enjoyable experience for them. We have not been hit by this trend, and we are working extremely hard to maintain that.</p><h4>What projects does ABC Group currently have in its pipeline?</h4><p><span></span>Although we have several ongoing projects, we are mainly focused on the absorption of 2017's projects. We have plans for new brands, standalone stores, and e-commerce. We have also launched Lebanon's first corporate think-tank where consultants work with young employees to come up with key projects. This comes from a German model and I am extremely interested to see how this can be transposed into a Lebanese retail company, as an internal tool, to work on ideas and react, since retail is changing significantly. At the same time, we have young talent who has not always had the opportunity to be involved at a corporate level, especially when it comes to preparing for the future. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Having additional properties in Malta and Liberia, and projects in Jordan, Scotland, and Bahrain, what specific role does Le Gray Hotel play in Beirut as part of the greater Campbell Gray Hotels portfolio?</h4><p><span></span>The qualitative yet fast expansion of the company is, to a certain extent, underlining the role of Le Gray Beirut as a loyal advocate to the philosophy of Gordon Campbell Gray. Le Gray's attention to layers and layers of details, understated approach to luxury, and finesse of quality delivery where everything is about service made a difference, surely. This is the role of Le Gray, and we will always be loyal to the vision and philosophy of Campbell Gray. We simply believe in it.</p><h4>What measures have been taken by Le Gray hotel in recent months to boost local, regional, and international visitor numbers?</h4><p>Le Gray's sales and marketing leaders managed to compose a well-structured plan focusing on penetrating new markets through social media platforms, fair participation, and invitations for international journalists and influencers. We have always believed that there is nothing better than a highly credible third-party endorsement to promote Lebanon as a destination and Le Gray as a luxury property. This creative effort has been accompanied by a thorough travel plan for our sales team focusing on the diversification of our business mix rather than continuously counting on a single source market in a highly elastic sector and politicized region.</p><h4>What further measures should be taken by the government and/or sector in order to assist luxury brands such as Le Gray in the attraction of visitors?</h4><p>The participation of the Lebanese Ministry of Tourism in international luxury fairs, organizing FAM trips for regional and international events organizers, and diversifying the business mix through creating demand from different markets to Lebanon will surely raise occupancy rates of luxury-brand hotels. On the same note, luxury brands are highly frequented by high-income people with great sensitivity to stability, safety, and security. And this is the government's main role: ensuring a safe and secure environment.</p><h4>In regard to Lebanon's tourism recovery plan, which areas of the country have experienced the most growth, and do you have any expansion plans in these areas?</h4><p>It is worth mentioning that the active tourism recovery plan created positive dynamics and aimed rigorously on repositioning the destination on the touristic map. That said, demand is still impacted by regional conflicts and a highly politicized atmosphere. Beirut, as the capital, remains the main destination for both leisure and business travelers alike. However, we are not witnessing an overflow of demand necessitating expansions to accommodate the demand.</p><h4>What are Le Gray Hotel's main objectives for 2018?</h4><p>With the inauguration of the extension project by the end of 2017, Le Gray's main objective is to penetrate the up-scale luxury conferences and events market and promote the newly inaugurated facilities. In parallel, and after adding more than 18% worth of room inventory, the team is determined to acquire its share from the MICE business through bundling attractive packages for our niche market. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[from-bust-to-boom]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us some background on the casino and recent developments that have affected its operations?</h4><p><span></span>In Lebanon, the casino is a place where many gather to eat and enjoy a broad selection of entertainment, in addition to gambling. Our main revenue stream, though, is gambling, and all the departments are designed to serve gambling. Even when we host large events, we do it with the intention of maximizing our gambling revenues. We want to bring people to the gaming rooms. Casinos in Lebanon face many problems at the moment. Casino du Liban has a concession for 30 years, and we are the only ones allowed to operate gambling houses in the country. With only eight years left in our concession, it is difficult to find new investors. New investment takes two or three years to get off the ground. The second problem we are facing is the high tax rate from the government; the government takes 50% of the company's revenue. The number of employees at the casino is another problem; it is currently too high, and salaries are also high. It is an inefficient operation. Furthermore, the government is not enforcing the closure of small, illegal gambling operations, which eats into our legitimate business.</p><h4>What do you expect to occur in eight years when your concession expires?</h4><p>After the election, we plan to apply for another concession for 30 years. Our primary goal at the moment is to lobby for this concession. We also want to pay less taxes. This is a Catch-22 in that although we pay high taxes, we are essentially then guaranteed to the government approval for another 30-year concession. Beyond that, we also employ 1,200 people, so we are a major source of employment.</p><h4>Are you currently operating at a profit?</h4><p>When I was appointed CEO of the casino, the losses were upward of USD6 million per year. We finished 2017 with a USD3 million surplus. This turnaround came into effect only after six months; we made a huge investment in the gaming rooms to buy new games, enticing many high rollers. In order to attract them to the casino, we pay for their travel and accommodation at the hotel. We also host large events for VIPs, bringing people from all over the region. We like to host top entertainment acts from around the region as well, and this draws people to our casino. Lebanon is a great place for tourism, and people like to come here and gamble.</p><h4>How much of your business is from foreigners?</h4><p>In terms of the number of customers, foreigners account for approximately 20%. In terms of revenue, foreigners make up close to 35% of our total revenue. Many of our high rollers are foreign visitors. We look to increase this group of visitors and have created a new department specifically for this.</p><h4>What new projects have you initiated?</h4><p>We are renovating our main restaurant and are planning many additional investments. However, we are waiting for the new concession before we jump into these projects. We could receive the concession in as little as six months. We are renovating a number of theaters, restaurants, and halls currently. In terms of large-scale investment, we are proposing creating a big new room for gambling. We also plan to start hosting an Texas hold 'em tournament. Moreover, we are keen to get into online betting and sports betting. We hope to develop an infrastructure similar to the sports betting infrastructure in places like Las Vegas.</p><h4>What are your targets for this fiscal year?</h4><p>We hope to record USD10 million in profits this year. Even if we do not receive the new concession in the next six months, we will create a new area for bingo, which is a popular game in Lebanon for all age groups. </p>]]></richbody0content>

What has been your strategy to achieve this?</h4><p><span></span>Addmind is a trendsetter for the region because we own and build all our own concepts; we do everything in-house. The company is based on people, and in this industry, companies always need the right flow and operations to succeed. We have our own contracting, architecture, marketing and design, accounting and auditing, and concept development divisions. We learn from our concepts and ideas at all our sites, and we try to lead the way for new trends. We always learn from our mistakes.</p><h4>Why did you decide to expand from Lebanon to Dubai?</h4><p>In the GCC, the only open market for our business is the UAE, mainly Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Dubai is a cosmopolitan place, and business people have a great deal of work going on there. It is an open market that is exposed to the world. All the main sectors are struggling in Lebanon under the current situation, and we had to look at another market to diversify our operations. We chose Dubai because it is a place where one can open entertainment facilities such as nightclubs. It is the closest environment to Lebanon in the region.</p><h4>Have you explored other markets, such as Europe or Africa, for expansion?</h4><p>We have not as we are still exploring the Middle East. For example, we recently franchised Iris in Bahrain. That opened in 4Q2017, and now we have Iris Bahrain. We have also franchised Iris in Qatar and that project is currently under construction. We are in the process of signing an Oman franchise deal as well.</p><h4>What entertainment brands are currently part of Addmind's portfolio?</h4><p>Our portfolio consists of beach clubs and beaches, lounges, restaurant-bars, restaurants, and clubs under a number of brands. Currently, Addmind mostly focuses on opening restaurants. Over the last year, we were more involved in the nightlife and lounge industry, which was our core business from the outset. However, now we are working to create a balance between our restaurant and nightlife offerings. Diversifying is a great way to ensure the company's growth into the future. We opened Matto restaurant in Dubai. In 1Q2018, we will launch our new Lebanese cafe and restaurant, as well as a Japanese restaurant, which is a new concept for us. We are also opening a smaller fusion Japanese bistro without a bar in a new cluster in Beirut called Zero Four.</p><h4>What areas in Beirut do you see the F&amp;B and hospitality industry moving toward in 2018?</h4><p>There is no individual area of interest; it is an open market. Lebanese people know what they like and they follow concepts, excellent service, and taste to wherever it is offered. In Lebanon, if one has a great concept and experience, people will come.</p><h4>How can companies like Addmind continue to attract people to visit Lebanon?</h4><p>Since we firmly believe in Lebanon, we work to open up new opportunities to invest in Lebanon. We are still opening new concepts; for example, our strategy and budget for 2018 will focus on opening seven new establishments in Lebanon. We have already opened three so far and have four in progress that we want to open by summer 2018.</p><h4>In addition to expansion, what other specific business objectives do you have for 2018?</h4><p>Our specific objective is to maintain the success of our existing products and deliver on all the new concepts we will open this year. Our Dubai nightclub, White Dubai, was ranked the 20th Best Club in the World by the renowned DJ Mag and was the only club in the Middle East to make the Top 100 list, coming in higher than clubs in London, New York, Ibiza, and Miami. We also launched two new venues in Dubai in January 2018—Drai's, a beach club and nightclub franchise from Vegas, and Soho Beach, a beach club destination with a pool, cabanas, and jacuzzis. We hold a big concert there every two weeks. The response to these new concepts has been excellent. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has AUB evolved to become the number-one university in Lebanon and the Arab world?</h4><p><span></span>Our university is 152 years old, and it has had a tremendous impact not only in the region but also around the world. During the civil war, the university maintained its campus and became a beacon of diversity and excellence. After the war, AUB emerged slowly and carefully to establish itself as a serious research university. One of the recent landmarks was the university's ranking as the top university in the Arab world. In addition, in 2018 we will tenure a significant number of faculty members for the first time since 1985. AUB produces more than 63% of all citable knowledge for Lebanon, the highest proportion of any major university in the Arab world for its nation of residence.</p><h4>What initiatives are you undertaking to promote entrepreneurship and interdisciplinary creative innovation?</h4><p>We are in the process of revamping our curriculum and developing what we hope will one day be a USD50-million innovation park and strategy. We expect to encourage entrepreneurs, students, faculty, and others to participate in interdisciplinary work that not only creates new knowledge but also potentially leads to the creation of new micro-economies. The Lebanese economy is excessively dependent on tourism, banking and finance, and family businesses. These are all important; however, the creation of a knowledge economy based on entrepreneurship is vital to long-term economic growth. Our department of education is the leading department of education in the Arab world, and is responsible for 11% of all new citable knowledge regarding teaching. There is a sense of entrepreneurship and resilience in the Lebanese and Arab population that we need to take advantage of in a positive and purposeful way. It is extremely important for AUB to combine our civic engagement with a sense of corporate and social responsibility.</p><h4>Where is investment most needed in terms of the quality of education in Lebanon?</h4><p>We are continually assessing and improving all our programs. We are required by our accrediting agencies to constantly study our programs and assess where we are doing well, where we can do better, and how we can improve. We have led a significant effort to look at our humanities curriculum and developed a general education approach to enhance the humanities component so that people can emerge as better writers, thinkers, and creators. At the same time, we are keen to revamp our education in areas such as technology, engineering, community service, athletics, and other areas. AUB is in the business of producing thoughtful, empathetic, and influential leaders across all sectors of the economy.</p><h4>What are AUB's main objectives and expansion plans for 2018?</h4><p>We launched our 'Boldly AUB' campaign because we had several major objectives. We first needed to become better at educating and attracting more diverse students. We need to raise our research capacity, so that it is world class in all aspects. We also want to reform the curriculum, expand our capacity, and potentially partner with other great international and regional universities, and the private and public sectors, in order to offer projects beyond our campus walls. We need to continue to raise the quality of healthcare. Although we have one of the finest medical centers in this part of the world, medicine is a rapidly evolving field, and we need to keep up. Finally, we need to continue to build our endowment. Specifically, for 2018, our goal is to improve our educational curriculum and start installing our updated, humanities intensified, general education. We have several buildings under construction, such as the Daniel Ambulatory Care Building and the Masri Institute for Energy Studies. Finally, we are building a state-of-the-art library for engineering and sciences. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been your strategy to maintain LAU as one of the leading educational institutions in Lebanon?</h4><p><span></span>We recently decided to focus on five strategic directions. The first one is the intellectual capital of the university. To excel, we must hire top-quality faculty and provide them with the opportunity to grow within the university. We must also provide them with a development program so that they can grow and respond to the needs of the students. At LAU, we like to pursue and expand the frontiers of knowledge and communicate that to others. This is why we focus on traditional education, but with a particular interest in humanities and social sciences. The second pillar is innovation. Technology is developing at such a fast rate that we have to adapt our curriculum to respond to the needs of the new generations of students and deliver content that is relevant to their growth. We are establishing an Innovation Center. One arm will be focused on innovation and re-engineering our curriculum, and the other arm will be in charge of promoting entrepreneurship among our students. The third strategic element is LAU Without Borders, which focuses on taking education where it is not available. My philosophy is that if people cannot come to our campus, we take the campus to them. In the Gulf, for example, we need to offer more than technology and online courses. We have to figure out how we can be present as an entity as well in those areas. The fourth pillar is focused on institutional branding and communication. All of this information has to be really processed internally as well as externally. The fifth and final strategic direction is the financial stability of the university. Financial aid and scholarships are extremely important, and we are complimenting it through fundraising. A major effort will be made in order to promote fundraising in Lebanon. We are working to also promote interdisciplinary programs, as to encourage departments to work with each other. The fourth revolution is bringing a strong focus on robotics, nanotechnology, quantum computing, the Internet of Things, and artificial intelligence. These five factors are imposing a threat of complete failure upon us if we do not bring different disciplines together. We need to foster joint degrees, for example, not only at LAU, but between different schools. Our approach is guided solely by our ambition to become the innovation university in the region.</p><h4>What is the university doing to increase the number of graduate students, who currently make up just 9% of the student body?</h4><p><span></span>This is one area that we need to promote more, and the board decided to grant the university an additional 100 new faculty members, making sure that the ratio between faculty and students is correct, promoting our various graduate programs. We are currently revising our master's program to do two things; first, to find out whether the master's programs we offer are still relevant. If they are, what are we doing to strengthen them? And if not, what kind of new master's programs do we need to open? The second reason is to address the financial impact of moving in that direction; we need to know if aid should cover 50%, 75%, or 100% of tuition for graduates. Another issue related to this is the price of PhD programs. We cannot go wholesale in this particular regard. The university ought to be in a position to connect with institutions outside Lebanon in order to provide students with PhD programs that we cannot offer. We will be addressing the matter thoroughly and will continue recommending the Board of Trustees on how to strengthen them.</p><h4>What are LAU's main objectives for 2018?</h4><p><span></span>Our main objective is to translate the strategic directions given to us by the board into specific actions on the ground. This is going to be our first and foremost responsibility until September, and it will catapult us into the limelight of innovation and excellence in Lebanon and the region. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the current situation of the Lebanese education system, and what are the main developments over the last few years?</h4><p>The education system has undergone three main developments. First, the impact of the Syrian crisis; we initially thought that the number of Syrian refugees in Lebanon would fall in 2017 and 2018, instead, we registered an increase in the number of Syrian children residing in Lebanon or being born in Lebanon. We currently have around 250,000 Syrian children enrolled in formal education and 70,000-80,000 in non—formal education. Another element is the commitments made by the international committee to cover education-related expenses. The Lebanese educational system needs rehabilitation, both in terms of human resources and physical infrastructure. We have recruited 12,000 Lebanese teachers to provide education to the Syrian refugees, which is a large figure for a country like Lebanon. The second important issue is the wages of professors in Lebanon. The newly introduced Law 46 in 2017, which significantly increased the salaries of professors and educators, has certain negative repercussions when applied to the private sector. Therefore, we will try to gradually introduce this law in private schools over a period of three years. Third, we recently received a loan and grant by the World Bank, allowing us to not only absorb the repercussions of the Syrian crisis on Lebanon, but also provide new support to the Lebanese educational system by providing more training to professors and establishing a new curriculum, a reform needed since 1997. We are entering a new phase of progress in the education system that will allow us to move forward with our 2030 vision—one that matches the objectives of the UN and the international community.</p><h4>How many Syrian child refugees are still without education?</h4><p>We are approaching the target of providing 400,000 children with access to education, though around 100,000-125,000 are yet to be located because they are either working in the agriculture industry or seriously abandoned. Many of these children were too old for school when they first arrived in Lebanon; however, we are tackling this issue with NGOs and the UN. To date, less than a third of Syrian children are out of school. The core program is to integrate all children into the education system, targeting all refugees. We have Iraqi refugees as well as children from other countries. Lebanon is extremely proud of what it has provided, and the international community has praised our efforts. The only problem is that most of these efforts were paid for at the expense of our own resources. Nevertheless, we are building up a new generation of Syrians who, we hope, will be grateful to Lebanon. It is moving to see Syrian children learning French and English here.</p><h4>What changes does the ministry expect to make to the existing curriculum?</h4><p>We are adding certain subjects related to mathematics and IT and introducing new programs to create a 21st century education program. We are also revising the traditional classical humanities, which include philosophy, civic education, and history. A cohesive history book has yet to be written in Lebanon because of the inheritance of the civil war. I am supervising the publication of a new history book. Collective memory will be a major instrument in consolidating national consensus and civil peace.</p><h4>What are the ministry's main objectives for 2018?</h4><p>The ministry recently inaugurated a new center for exams that is completely automated and linked to 1,200 public schools. We will also launch the World Bank program this year. Moreover, 2018 will witness the launch of the 2030 Vision. This is the year of improvement in the quality of education and we have already kicked off several renovation projects. Notably, we have reinforced kindergarten, but we still need to improve our intermediary public school network. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Where do the Health Medical Services fit within the health sector in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi in terms of addressing capacity gaps? </h4><p>Seeing multiple gaps in the existing healthcare market, we started ten years ago as a healthcare consultancy, setting up businesses for more than 100 medical facilities, which included clinics, medical centers, homecare and pharmacies. We chose Al Ain as it has a developing healthcare market and a prospect of being a medical tourism destination. The population of Al Ain previously had to travel, either to Abu Dhabi, Dubai or even abroad, to benefit from tertiary or supportive healthcare. However, the gap has been bridged, to a certain extent, due to an improvement in outreach and accessibility to care. After the initial few years, we also diversified into providing homecare services, having exponentially grown in the number of personnel providing quality service to our clients, with a fair geographical distribution across the UAE. Over the years, with the help of feasibility studies and population surveys, we have addressed the special needs segment of chiropractic, occupational therapy, speech therapy, ambulance services and audiology by establishing a rehabilitation center. The US-based Accreditation Commission for Health Care vetting our quality of service to the clients, was also an important milestone. For the future, we are thinking of establishing medical centers with multi ethnic healthcare personnel, to enhance the communication channels between clients of different nationalities, resulting in effective healthcare delivery. Currently we perceive ourselves well placed, as an organization, addressing the needs of the clients, with a diversified healthcare delivery system, spread across different domains.</p><h4>What are some of the most relevant special health services that are in demand and why do you think this is the case? </h4><p>The feasibility studies and surveys have helped us in understanding that the outreach of supportive services is the area that needs to be tapped. There is also a need for effective patient and family education. Healthcare personnel needs to deliver a variety of services, engage constantly with the clients, make them aware of their contribution towards the well-being, as prevention is always better than cure. This will require an active involvement and co-operation from all the stakeholders in the healthcare market and should be driven by the regulatory bodies in UAE. Once these issues are solved, major areas of focus that hold a good deal of potential, are rehabilitation centers and tele-medicine, which is also an uncharted territory in the UAE.</p><h4>What medical fields and processes are likely to be most affected by the advent of digitization?</h4><p>Digitization has its pros and cons. On the one hand, it does help in bringing down the timeframe in completing processes and primarily improves accessibility to different specialties and needs, such as telemedicine. The down part is data security maintenance (patient confidentiality) and the high investments required in setting up the system, which can be worked around by defining and understanding the scope and delivery systems of an organization. I also see a significant change in the way medical records are made, maintained and disposed with the advent of digitization. No matter how advanced or digitized the healthcare domain does become, it still requires the “human touch." That being said, the pressing issue currently in the emirate of Abu Dhabi is the stability of medical practitioners within an organization; physicians moving from one organization to another does not instill confidence in the patient, due to inaccessibility during the time of requirement. There should be a regulatory mechanism in place to safeguard the interests of the organization too.</p><h4>What is the key to solving the heavier presence of public sector medical facilities in Al Ain and what opportunities can stem from an eventual resolution?</h4><p>There needs to be more transparency in the communications between investors, insurance companies, and government, along with a strategic alignment with the Abu Dhabi Economic Vision 2030 and UAE Vision 2021. Moreover, there needs to be a stability in the rules for payouts by insurance companies; ratings to facilities are being implemented in questionable ways, so that insurance companies have to pay back less. This ends up being an added burden to the facilities. Another primary concern is the wages gap between the government and private sector. If there is a cushion for the return on investments made by the private medical facilities, to thrive and sustain, especially the small players, this wage gap can be reduced to a certain extent, though might be not be completely eliminated.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you define the Costa Rican identity today?</h4><p>Beyond legal security and favorable environments for investors, Costa Rica is the only country that has a historical democratic foundation, which is fundamental to secure the long-term stability of the economic outlooks. Many have bought into the short-term incentives given by our neighbors in the region and end up returning here because value-added, long-term business strategies need more than low costs and infrastructure projects.</p><h4>What are the plans to promote and continue with the Central American Integration System (SICA) agenda?</h4><p>Celebrating 200 years of our republic during our administration, we are extremely committed to advancing the agenda of SICA with the necessary reforms. We need to align the objectives of certain SICA institutions to serve the development needs of our countries and the region. We need to adapt the organization to understand the specific situation of countries that promote more advanced agendas. For example, while there are countries that live with 50 or 60% poverty rates, ours is around 20%, so we want to advance the sustainable development agenda. We also understand the need to strengthen our regional market, as our neighbors should be our main trading partners, and we should be theirs. The strengthening of the Central American institution may allow Costa Rica to have greater economic opportunities in closer markets, so that the local economy can have more benefits and to open access channels for SMEs that have difficulty accessing and logistics to markets geographically farther.</p><h4>What is the new administration's perspective and position in terms of access to organizations like the OECD?</h4><p>The most important challenge in Costa Rica is to make the most out of the commercial agreements that it has already signed with different partners, rather than intensively spending diplomatic capital on signing new ones. We were the first country in the region to establish economic and political relations with China. We could do more things with the UK, which is our most important business partner. We are making an important institutional effort to achieve accession to the OECD with all the advantages that it implies. The OECD far exceeds the commercial issue. We will adopt important standards related to efficiency, transparency, use of public funds, use of data, education, and technology. On the other hand, we will consider joining the Pacific Alliance as long as we can protect our highly vulnerable sectors that have an impact in the regions they are located, such as the agricultural sector. Many times, we enter into competition against heavily subsidized industries, which diminishes the sectors that continue generating a large amount of employment and that are still important in different regions of the country as they lose competitiveness. However, we have important advantages, such as in the area of services.</p><h4>What are the main priorities on the agenda of the new administration?</h4><p>One of the most important elements of this administration will be decarbonization. This project brings together specific government actions, the first of which is public transportation. When we decided to change the country's energy matrix to do away with fossil fuels, it implied the absolute transformation of the means of transportation. High-speed railways is one of the most important projects in the urban sector that also requires a large number of long-term private investments. We need financing that is attractive for the country and investors. On the other hand, the freight train on the northern border with APM Terminals is another great and necessary project that we must consolidate in the short term. There are some important investments in the infrastructure sector that we have pending. One of them is public infrastructure. We have to advance significantly the construction of certain hospitals that we do not have fully funded, for example, the Hospital of Limón and the geriatric hospital. We have to accelerate investment in telecommunications to generate all the necessary conditions for another kind of investments. We want to guarantee universal access to the internet, which can jumpstart development in most impoverished areas of the country. Costa Rica plans to become a global green lab where the best experimentations on environmental sustainability and climate change are made. This space is a great investment scenario linked to the decarbonization plan and the use of renewable energies nationwide.</p><h4>What message would you like to send to the investment community in terms of the structural changes in the free zone or the promotion of systems of public and private sector concessions?</h4><p>Free zone regimes will be maintained. The democratic system works, and the investment attraction models that have produced important results cannot be changed on a whim. There is a national plan that aims to increase the supply of bilingual and technical personnel. We have a policy with public-private partnerships, and the most significant manifestation of that is that President Alvarado has in his cabinet a representative of the private sector to look at where the joint investment opportunities are and where are the strengths and weaknesses of each one to start specific investment projects. Decisions have also been made to reduce the red tape through leaning due diligence for operating businesses.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[best-in-service]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What strategy have you followed to maintain MEA as the pride of Lebanon?</h4><p><span></span>Any airline company must have the ability to compete, and this necessitates cost control. We should maximize our staff productivity and decrease our unit cost. On the other hand, we must provide our customers with the best service. MEA has chosen a niche market where people are looking for the best service both on ground and onboard. Therefore, 20% of our seats are business class, a high percentage compared to other airlines in the world. We also have invested in the best entertainment system and lounges for our passengers. The average age of our fleet is five to six years, and we do not keep any aircraft for more than 12 years. MEA provides the best flight schedules and frequencies, focusing on our regional network and on destinations that Lebanon has economic ties with. We have a 37% market share at Rafic Hariri International Airport in Beirut and currently fly to 33 destinations. Our net profit for 2017 was around USD95 million, compared to USD94 million in 2016. But our operating result is less for 2017 because of decreasing yields, increasing fuel prices, and so forth. This has been offset by the sale of two aircraft.</p><h4>To what extent have you seen an increase in the number of passengers traveling with MEA?</h4><p>MEA had a YoY increase of around 8.5% in 2017. With our new fleet, we will have an increased passenger capacity because the A321 is larger than the A320. However, our A321 aircraft are being equipped to the highest standards with only 160 seats, instead of the maximum capacity of 230 seats. We are keeping the planes spacious and comfortable. These new aircraft will consist of 28 business class seats and 132 economy class seats.</p><h4>What impact is the MEA Training and Conference Center expected to have in Lebanon?</h4><p>Having a conference center in Beirut is important for business activities. The center is open to everybody; it is not only for airlines. At the moment, we do not have many customers coming from outside Lebanon for training, but once the political situation improves, we expect to attract more clients. However, a training center is needed in Beirut because Lebanon has an advantage in terms of its human talent. This is a state-of-the-art center, equipped with the most advanced simulators for both pilots and cabin crew training. It is also one of the best centers for aircraft engineering and maintenance training. We will also be offering training for commercial activities, cargo handling, and so forth.</p><h4>Does MEA have any other projects coming up in 2018 and beyond?</h4><p>The construction of our new maintenance facility will begin at the end of 2019 and should be ready in mid to late 2021. We are demolishing all our existing buildings that are not eco-friendly, and our new green building will be completed by 2019.</p><h4>What are MEA's main business objectives in 2018?</h4><p>The main objective is to maintain our profits. We have been distributing profits to our shareholders for the last 10 years hoping to continue this way. We are aiming to distribute one dollar per share in 2018, meaning USD55 million per year out of sales of USD800 million. There are a lot of hubs in the region with good connectivity and movement of traffic between the Gulf and Europe, but this is not the basis of our network; it is complementary to our network. MEA is a SkyTeam member, but we are open to operating with a variety of partners. For example, we just signed a new code share agreement with Kuwait Airways, and in 2017 we signed the same deal with Turkish Airlines. We also have code-share agreements with other airlines, such as Qatar Airways, Etihad, and Air Canada. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does DHL Lebanon play in the company's current regional and international strategies?</h4><p>Lebanon is one of the 228 countries and territories in which DHL operates and is part of the largest transport network in the world. In Lebanon, we do our part to ensure that we provide our customers with world-class service. This requires continued investment in our people and in our infrastructure to ensure the service levels in and across Lebanon are as good as, if not better than, anywhere else in the DHL network.</p><h4>What were DHL Lebanon's main highlights during 2017, and what can be expected in 2018?</h4><p>2017 was a busy year in which we made numerous improvements to our business processes and focused a great deal on training. First and foremost, our on-time performance improved again, meaning we delivered faster and more consistently than ever before. This was achieved by leveraging our DHL flights as well as a number of commercial flights both in Lebanon and throughout the entire DHL network. The recent upgrades to our facilities and flight operations around the world have made us faster and more efficient, once again, boosting service levels. The infrastructure upgrades were complemented by a great deal of training at all levels of the organization to ensure that we can confidently stand by our claim of being the international transportation specialists.</p><h4>What is DHL's current involvement in e-commerce, and how will it influence economic development in Lebanon?</h4><p>There are an estimated 1.6 billion online shoppers, and that number is growing at a rapid pace. E-commerce is generating substantial international volumes and has become an important part of our business. This is a dynamic, exciting sector, and DHL is ideally positioned to provide e-tailers with a single global delivery solution at the click of a button. We have developed IT solutions that allow our customers to process and track orders quickly and efficiently and provide their customers with enhanced last-mile delivery capabilities. Again, in addition to the technological improvements being made to our operational platform to cater to e-commerce, we are also investing in transferring the knowledge required to serve our e-commerce customers. All of the above provide online merchants in Lebanon with the capability to deliver their products anywhere in the world as fast as, if not faster than, our competitors. As delivery is a key factor in the success of an online business, DHL plays an important role in the growth of this sector.</p><h4>What are DHL's main objectives for 2018?</h4><p>We will double down on quality as a vehicle for growth by continuing our drive to improve everything we do. That begins with more training, further improving our processes and additional investment in the global network infrastructure. This is not a new approach but is one that provides tangible results to our customers. We will also continue to build capacity and capabilities to support the growth of the e-commerce sector to which Lebanon is no stranger. Many businesses, old and new, have embraced the concept, leveraging the internet to market and sell their products online.  We believe that Lebanese businesses are ideally positioned to take advantage of the global online market place. And DHL, the world's most global company, is here to deliver. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What further ICT infrastructure developments should be made to boost the sector's impact on the economy?</h4><p>The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN-DESA) produces the e-Government Development Index (EGDI) that measures three primary indicators: digital services offered by governments, the telecommunication infrastructure, and human capital. If these three indicators are considered, the ICT sector can be responsible for the boost in economy. The ICT sector is the largest employer compared to other sectors. We are constantly on the lookout for ICT graduates and need more interest from potential students in the ICT sector. Lebanon also needs better and more affordable digital infrastructure. We also need a national digital transformation strategy aimed at shifting e-government services to the cloud that will enable the emergence of new ICT sectors such as micro services and an apps industry.</p><h4>Which of the services offered by Everteam in Lebanon are currently most in demand?</h4><p><span></span>Lebanon's positioning in terms of the digital transformation is typically irregular, unstructured, and cautious. Lebanon has in fact still not adopted a clear digital transformation plan. Since the country is still in need of a digital foundation, we have been focusing on the back office automation of e-government over the past years. We have been transforming back office operations through government resource planning initiatives by content-enabling back office business applications such as human resources, payroll, budgeting, stock, inventory, and others, and by digitally transforming internal processes through the automation of various types of requests coming from various sources, in various formats.</p><h4>How do you see these services evolving in 2018?</h4><p><span></span>As the technological revolution advances, Everteam provides a new micro service architecture that includes a modernized application layer to build content-centric applications. The company is also taking a giant step towards the future by focusing more on business- and citizen-centric solutions. As a matter of fact, we will strengthen our positioning in big data and analytics and focus on integrating this modern technology more with IoT software and services. Our customers will also be able to see more of our AI-backed biometric solutions, which are witnessing rapid transformation through facial recognition, speech to text, and chatbot technologies. We will also leverage the power of deep learning augmenting the abilities of bots. In addition, we plan to port our IoT enabled solutions on top of a robust blockchain platform.</p><h4>What distinguishes Everteam from its competition when delivering client confidence?</h4><p><span></span>Everteam brings a broad set of platform level capabilities across content and process services coupled with big data, analytics, and the cloud. Over the years, Everteam has sustained a positioning strategy in the industry that incorporates superior service quality, innovative solutions, and proximity. We deliver advanced and high-market platforms and provide our customers with the ability to develop and customize processes that match their goals, through an open architecture. We incorporate our product and technology experts within our team members locally in Lebanon. Our sales, software, product, R&amp;D, and quality assurance engineers are involved in the entire project lifecycle, helping organizations to drive their call for digital transformation.</p><h4>What are Everteam's main objectives for 2018?</h4><p><span></span>Everteam's plan to sustain in the future is divided into several areas. The first is a technological expansion: we will continue to invest in technology areas, as what is new today can be outdated tomorrow. The second is a geographical and structural expansion. We are in the process of hiring around 100 engineers in Lebanon and are looking at an international expansion to Central Asia and Africa. The company's executive committee has also put in place an aggressive expansion strategy. In the past decade, Everteam has made several acquisitions around the world, allowing the group to expand its operations to the US and Asia; with this, Everteam will be able to enter new markets, mainly the SME market, and propose new solutions. Today the company also looks to acquire businesses in the financial sector. Our mission is to help organizations all over the world reduce costs, minimize risks, and ensure compliance with norms and regulations, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and cybersecurity. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Which strategies have driven the success and expansion of RGH Holding in Lebanon and the EMEA region?</h4><p><span></span>RGH Holding's growth from a family printing business to a diversified international investment group has mainly been driven by three factors: a dedicated focus on R&amp;D, the ability to innovate and anticipate the demands of niche markets, and sustained investment in human talent. Our R&amp;D strategy is proactive and driven by a determination to venture into new technologies ahead of demand. We analyse opportunities, foresee trends and needs, conduct research, and come up with solutions that focus on enhancing people's lives. After all, citizens ultimately want fast processes, convenience, and security. Human talent is an essential part of any business. With over 2,000 employees today, RGH Holding aims to continue investing in local creative talent because we believe it sustains a healthy business ecosystem. Part of our strategy lies in supporting rising young entrepreneurs by providing the necessary mentorship, guidance, and financial support to incubate and grow their businesses. Entrepreneurship drives innovation, creates jobs, and boosts the economy. Accordingly, our mission is to enhance our economic growth and retain valuable human capital by creating a space in which entrepreneurs and their ideas can succeed.</p><h4>Being an incubator for start-ups, how do you think SMEs should protect themselves from the rising number of cyber attacks globally?</h4><p><span></span>Cybersecurity is a primary concern for SMEs. Despite the rising concern about cyber attacks, awareness of such threats is still low, and thus vulnerable to ransomware attacks. To reduce those risks, SMEs should continuously be upskilled on security challenges relating to the Internet of Things, human errors, and cloud technology. In this case, it becomes every employee's responsibility and not just an IT department matter.</p><h4>How is RGH Holding contributing to Lebanon's digital transformation?</h4><p>Digital transformation is a necessity and is in full swing in Lebanon. The public sector is reaping the benefits of government automation. We work closely with the Lebanese government on several projects such as e-vehicle solutions, biometric passports, e-residency permits and e-work permits. Future opportunities are legion, and we aim to continue providing beneficial solutions to Lebanese citizens. Moreover, Serta, a subsidiary of RGH Holding, is contributing to this digital transformation. The company was awarded a major part of the national fiber optic tender in Lebanon. The last time an infrastructure project of this size was implemented in Lebanon was in 2004. The introduction of fiber optics will create a technological revolution as high-speed internet opens countless new business opportunities locally and internationally. This project will put us on par with industrialized countries in terms of internet speed.</p><h4>What new technologies and/or trends is RGH Holding expecting to introduce during the course of 2018?</h4><p>We are focusing on developments in digital identity, connectivity, and cybersecurity. Supplying governments with automation technologies is a top priority for us, as this will ultimately improve citizens' lives and protect their identities. Also, we believe that connectivity is a key economic driver. Securely and seamlessly connecting citizens with one another, government, and businesses creates a climate conducive to personal and economic growth. Finally, securing data is another priority for us. Therefore, we are working hard to develop cybersecurity solutions that will assist companies in preventing or countering cybercriminals attacks.</p><h4>Besides government automation, to what extent would e-governance boost economic growth and improve the country's current 'Doing Business' ranking?</h4><p><span></span>Successful e-governance will boost the economy by reducing costs and increasing efficiency and transparency. Digital technologies allow governments to streamline their processes and create a secure, more efficient and more rapid flow of information to citizens, governmental agencies, and the private sector. E-governance is a prerequisite for creating sustainable societies. If we get this right, everything falls in to place: people can transact and do business more efficiently, and the economy benefits as a result. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[250 Projects Completed]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[ali-al-khalifa-ceo-astad]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What flagship projects has ASTAD developed in Qatar?</h4><p>ASTAD has completed more than 250 projects, though there are some projects we really take an honor in having been a part of, such as the Museum of Islamic Art, Qatar Faculty of Islamic Studies, Qatar National Convention Center, and the Lusail Sports Arena. This arena was due for completion for the 2015 World Handball Championship, and despite the tight schedule, it was completed in two years. In 2017, we also worked on three iconic projects: Qatar National Library, Sidra Medicine, and North Western University. We currently have an active project portfolio which includes the National Museum of Qatar, Qatar Foundation Stadium, and several rail projects.</p><h4>How is your international portfolio developing?</h4><p>We recently completed our five-year business strategy with the support of McKinsey and identified strategic partnerships as the way forward with operations abroad. We signed an agreement with a theme park consultancy firm in the US and have done the same with several real estate and construction stakeholders in Korea, Oman, Kuwait, Tunisia, France, Turkey, and the UK as well as in Russia, which will allow us to enter East Europe. As ASTAD grows internationally, we want to strengthen our collaboration with the existing market operators that share the same values. We are investing a lot of time in research and market analysis before collaborating with firms worldwide. We currently have offices and projects in Oman, Kuwait, UK, Sudan, Somalia and Burkina Faso. We help suitable and carefully selected international partners enter the Qatari market, which has led us to work with leading firms that have worked with the likes of Disney on projects in Qatar.</p><h4>How has the blockade affected the operations of ASTAD?</h4><p>Certain companies in Qatar were dependent on specific suppliers and as a result of the blockade, they had to search for different suppliers quickly, which was not a difficult task. The case for ASTAD was different, as we had already put a strategy in place to penetrate other markets. We accelerated this strategy, and today we find ourselves operating in countries with great potential for our business in East Europe and Africa, for example. For some other countries, operations are managed from Doha and executed through a local partner. Alternative faster, cheaper and higher quality suppliers were sourced and operations in Qatar, if anything, are now progressing more positively.</p><h4>How can any party involved in a construction project benefit from SANAD?</h4><p>SANAD is a solution developed by ASTAD to support the contractual procedures within this region's construction industry. SANAD is the result of a wealth of experience gained by ASTAD after working on so many complex projects in numerous sectors. It lays out the best ways of communication and cooperation between the contractor, consultants, and the client in a project. We used internationally known models as a reference and combined that with our expertise in Qatar. We have received positive feedback from contractors and clients in countries including Kuwait and Oman, and market operators now use SANAD locally in Qatar, which is why we now have a version in Arabic. Soon, we will also have it in French to serve as an asset in our international operations. We see SANAD as our social contribution to the construction industry. We took the steps to put together market expertise and share it with the industry at zero cost. The only thing we ask is that the users give us feedback within a year. We have won several awards for SANAD, including an award for social responsibility in engineering in Oman and recognition in Qatar.</p><h4>What is the added value of having a local project management company like ASTAD for operations in Qatar?</h4><p>We have more than 800 employees from 62 nationalities and have extensive experience in sectors such as aviation, sports, transportation, residential, education, hospitality, infrastructure, culture, and commercial. We have over 250 projects with a decade of experience within this industry locally, and we work internationally so we are well aware and well versed in the differences between operating within or outside of Qatar. ASTAD has the right mix of skills and a deep understanding of Qatar's construction industry in terms of what the authorities need, what might be acceptable in Qatar, and what will not work in Qatar. We understand contractors and deal with them accordingly. This is one of the reasons we established SANAD, because countries like Qatar do not make money from liquidated damages. Oil is a major source of income for Qatar, and we seek to invest this resource in the most efficient way possible to guarantee our future generations' wellbeing. All parties in a construction project need to fully understand how a project fits into the future of the country, adding value and reducing the risks and the difficulties involved.</p><h4>What is the outlook for ASTAD in 2019?</h4><p>Thus far in 2018 we have won several major projects in more than six countries, which will keep us busy in the upcoming year. In the past, we worked to develop solutions for rail construction, and today ASTAD is part of all rail-related projects. ASTAD aims to work in rail in Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, and across the Silk Road. Additionally, we look forward to winning more projects in the aviation sector. We see aviation as a strategic sector for our business and, in this regard, Africa is a region with huge potential. Regionally, Oman and Qatar also present great business opportunities. There will be another airport in the country, so aviation is a sector that we will focus more on in 2019, while keeping in mind that infrastructure will remain our core business.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[yasser-al-jaidah-ceo-qatar-cool]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>
	How important is energy efficiency for cooling facilities in a country like Qatar?</h4><p>Energy efficiency needs to be a priority for many reasons. Electricity is not free, and the country needs to produce it. Qatar uses natural gas, so the more efficient Qatar is in utilizing this asset, the better the country will be. Qatar Cool plays a key role in bringing energy-efficient solutions for district cooling in Qatar. The savings that district cooling can bring from CAPEX to OPEX on the lifecycle of a project are considerable. Most importantly, energy efficiency is crucial for environmental sustainability. We actively drive this by our involvement with specific authorities and within the government. We try to push forward an agenda of district cooling and zoning. We have showed policymakers the benefit of having specific policy agendas for a more sustainable environment. We also participate in conferences and write-ups, advocating energy efficiency, sustainability, and the environment. Qatar Cool has  an MoU with Tarsheed that will push for further electricity and water conservation. One of our main partners in Qatar is the Qatar Environment and Energy Research Institute (QEERI) , which has helped us in our research and development agenda to increase usage of sustainable sources, such as recycled water as opposed to fresh water.</p><h4>How do you maintain a high level of consumer satisfaction?</h4><p>A customer-centric focus is not only a priority for us, but rather a value. It is ingrained in the way we do things. The customer always comes first. As a result of our customer focus committee, we cover all areas related to customer services, from complaints to experience and touch points, allowing customers to interact easily with the company. We work consistently to identify the root causes of the complaints so that broader actions can be started.</p><h4>How do you raise awareness of your CSR initiatives?</h4><p>We are heavily involved in water conservation efforts and workshops around the country. There is a range of events that happen annually that we are involved in. Our main focus is young people. We try to build understanding and respect for the environment at an early age so that this becomes part of their values. In this regard, we also organize many activities with children to interact with the environment and learn by playing and having fun.
</p><h4>How will your fourth new cooling plant increase your capacity?</h4><p>
	It will suffice the increase in demand we are witnessing in West Bay and also create capacity for the city infrastructures being built by Qatar Rail. There are certain buildings under construction that will be hooked up to our grid. The new plant will create a substantial capacity of 35,000 Tons of refrigeration with a thermal energy storage of 25,000 Ton hours. We plan to add more plants and have an expansion agenda that goes beyond Qatar. The country is going through consolidation; we are looking at growth through acquisitions within Qatar. Abroad, we have a specific framework we are working on that looks at the macro and micro elements in the countries we are eying.
</p><h4>
	What potential do you see in the international market?
</h4><p>
	Based on our research, district energy is on the rise. We are the fifth-largest company in district cooling internationally. UN-Energy advocates district cooling, giving its overall savings for the country itself. After several years, the savings could be as high as QAR15 billion (USD4.12 billion), a large part of which is OPEX. Governments should consider district cooling as part of their urban planning by reclassifying district energy as a utility. It is important to work out cost recovery models because what makes district cooling costly is the infrastructure and capital costs required to build it. If the government lays down the pipelines and then has providers to offer the product, it would lead to substantial savings for consumers, therefore increasing the acceptance of district cooling. Another element is zoning and asset allocation,  if a company knew ahead of time that a certain zone is approved for district cooling, it could better plan on its loads. Currently, many people cannot invest early because they do not know what a zone will look like. Internationally, there needs to be more organizations and people advocating this, which is what we are doing at sectorial and urban planning.
</p><h4>What are your main goals for 2019?</h4><p>
	For us, the market in Qatar has plateaued. We are now looking for opportunities to consolidate our business. There are districts in Qatar that are growing, and we will build plants to increase our capacity. For example, The Pearl Qatar is growing, and we need to grow with it to cater to the increasing population. In order to grow our business in 2019, we will follow both organic and inorganic strategies. We have subsidiaries that do water treatment and air balancing, and we are trying to grow these in these areas. There are elements of strategic international partnering that we are considering at the moment. We also want to expand beyond commercial real estate to the industrial sector, such as oil and gas, to bring in our cooling solutions. All these will take place while we put our international business agenda forward.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have Lebanon and the MENA region contributed to Diageo's global growth in 2017?</h4><p><span></span>Globally, Diageo increased its net sales by 1.7% in its December 2017 results, but Lebanon exceeded this by growing its net sales 6%. What is important for us here is not so much growing our sales to market, but growing our in-market brand performance. Lebanon is a scotch market, and we are the leaders in market share when it comes to scotch, which is the biggest spirit category and second only to beer overall. We grew our share in this market from 63 to 64%, which is huge from an industry perspective. In addition, our market share for vodka is around 8%. Our only beer product is Corona and is the fastest-growing beer brand in the country, even though the market share for imported beer has not been as high as local beers.</p><h4>Do you see growth for all of your segments in 2018?</h4><p><span></span>The total whiskey market dropped by 1% in 2017 compared to 2016, but Diageo's whiskey business grew by 6%. The vodka market in Lebanon grew by 1%, versus 10% for Diageo's. That is a clear confirmation we are outperforming the market. Both arak and champagne experienced respective drops of 9% and 18%. Main drivers for such a decline are visitors choosing to buy cheaper alternatives instead of champagne. Lebanon's consumption for champagne used to be much higher, and this was mainly driven by tourists and visitors. Nevertheless, sparkling wine grew by 18%, rum grew by 6%, tequila grew by 17%, and gin, from a low base, grew by 35%.</p><h4>What steps should the government take in order to improve the food and beverage industry's performance?</h4><p><span></span>What we need from the government is stability and a strategic approach to legislation and reforms through which we feel our industry is supported. The government was trying to introduce a new excise duty as high as 35%, which would have caused serious damage to the industry. Sudden changes to legislation and tax models can have a drastic impact on the economy, industry performance, and systems if industry experts are not brought to the table.  By expertise, I meant best practices and capabilities built throughout wide global networks and markets. Also, we need a much closer focus from the government on designing strategies and solutions to stop parallel imports and counterfeiting. Both issues have grown so much to promote unfair competition, pricing confusion, and extreme pressures on brand owners and on our intellectual property protection agenda. We collaborate closely with the authorities to stop parallel trading because we want stability and a level playing field in the pricing of alcohol. We want to bring trust back to our industry system and be seen as key contributors to the economy. Lebanon is unique amongst its neighboring Middle Eastern markets as the only country where alcohol advertising and branding are permitted. This creates room to innovate and build brands and markets to ladder up the whole industry. What we create and innovate here gets replicated in other places like Dubai, and we want the authorities to be aware of and support this. We work closely with the Ministry of Tourism and the Ministry of Economy and Trade and want the legislation to be favorable to our industry and operating environment, instead of suggesting adverse reforms and tax changes that are not based on proper econometrics and data. This is part of our role as a business partner. We are proud to have been present in Lebanon for the last 20 years, and we want to keep growing this partnership with the country. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What strategy is BUS employing to grow and achieve its goals?</h4><p><span></span>We understood from the beginning the challenge was people-oriented rather than technical. We had to choose strong partners both in the region and across the globe to help us build this knowledge within the group. We were specialized in terms of EPC, but we also started working to diversify into services. We worked with some of the best firms to help us design and implement strategies to reach our goals, but we understood that the main success would come from developing the skills and competencies of people within our company. To this end, our training and the technical facility we established were key. This new facility is designed to train our people on both the technical and process fronts. We also implemented a complete project control system that allow us to monitor developments in great detail and see how our project is progressing and how we might improve our efforts. It has also allowed us to verify that proper safety procedures were being implemented. We have a dedicated department within the company that is tasked with monitoring everything, conducting analyses, and issuing reports. </p><h4>How successful have your smart metering technologies been?</h4><p>This project, which we were awarded in 2012, covers the whole value chain of the distribution sector, and we are managing the distribution sector on behalf of EDL. We are also doing the design and planning for the whole system and are working hard to take into consideration the growth of demand. We are responsible for the construction of new networks and facilities, as well as operations and maintenance. Additionally, we are the sole point of communication for customers and are responsible for metering, bill collection, and reporting. The smart metering is at the core of this project. Since we were unable to install these meters in the first five years of the project, we received an extension allowing us enough time to install them. As a core part of fixing and modernizing the distribution network, these meters are vital. We have done a number of live tests and pilot projects; however, though everything went well, especially with the testimony of international experts, we could not get the green light to deploy the system. This is a major milestone for EDL, and it wants to make sure that transitioning to smart systems can be as problem free as possible. Smart meters are valuable because they improve the collection process of EDL and reduce the instances of illegal activity. The meters do this through accurate consumption readings and then automatically transmit this data to the AMI center. </p><h4>How have the group's activities in renewable energy sources been developed?</h4><p>The group is interested in developing its activities on the renewable side. We have an IPP in Jordan and have just signed a PPA with the ministry here in Lebanon. We will also be participating with one of the three companies that the ministry has signed PPAs with to build wind farms. We are investing in one of these farms and have started to work on the early stages of the project. We strongly believe in the renewable sector. We have also expressed interest in solar farms that the ministry has proposed, and are among the firms that have submitted applications and expressions of interest. The timeline for the solar farm is largely contingent on how quickly the government is able to move. </p><h4>What are BUS' main business objectives for 2018?</h4><p>We are looking to expand our knowledge and experience abroad through our two main competitive advantages: our proven track record of success and the fact that we are from one of the most difficult countries in terms of electrical distribution; whoever succeeds in Lebanon can succeed anywhere. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What makes the oil industry so diverse, and how is it specifically developing in Lebanon?</h4><p><span></span>Access to secure and reliable sources of energy is critical for the economic development of Lebanon and for triggering economic competitiveness in other productive sectors. Across the value chain of petroleum activities, the development of the prospective hydrocarbon resources will require capital-intensive investments that will have direct and indirect impacts on the Lebanese economy and society. In the short term, petroleum activities will trigger demand for goods and services in the oil and non-oil economy, while in the longer term the resulting revenues will be placed in a sovereign wealth fund and be invested and/or saved, depending on the law that defines the strategy of the fund. Beyond the direct financial returns, the prospective resources could transform Lebanon into an energy-independent country, thus reducing the fiscal burden of the energy import bill. Several impacts could result from access to indigenous petroleum resources, such as ripple effects across several sectors of the Lebanese economy, creating added value, and increasing purchasing power and competitiveness. In Lebanon the local market is capable of monetizing the prospective gas resources, as the electricity sector will be the first off-taker of natural gas. The medium industrial hubs, including energy-intensive industries, could also benefit from access to indigenous petroleum resources. In the longer term, the transport sector could also benefit from natural gas resources. Regarding employment, Lebanese legislation includes provisions for local content emphasizing employment, training, and procurement. With regard to employment and training, the provisions stipulate that at least 80% of employees must be Lebanese nationals. This target is to be reached gradually and could be subject of exemptions if justified, especially in the early phases of development of the sector. Regarding procurement, preferential treatment will be given for the procurement of Lebanese-originating goods and services exists, provided such goods and services are internationally competitive with respect to quality, availability, price, and performance.</p><h4>How do you deal with the challenge of renewable energy to the gas industry?</h4><p>We do not perceive the inclusion of renewable energy sources as a challenge in the energy mix. With the climate change convention, Lebanon seeks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by using renewable energy and conventional sources of energy that are less polluting. Lebanon is committed to the Paris Agreement in its intention to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 12% by 2020, as an unconditional target, and by 30% by 2030 as a conditional one. Lebanon is close to achieving the 12% target in terms of total demand for electricity and heating. However, few countries are able to generate power solely relying on renewable energy sources because of cost, access to finance, storage, availability of suitable land, reliability, and security of uninterrupted supply, to name but a few. To cover the power demand gap, we need a reliable source of energy such as natural gas, which is cheaper and less polluting than heavy fuel oil, gasoline, and others that are currently being imported. The inclusion of prospective indigenous natural gas to the energy mix in Lebanon represents a transitional energy that is relatively cleaner and cheaper compared to existing sources of imported heavy fuels. Lebanon is planning to gradually increase its utilization of natural gas in the energy mix, and there are plans to gasify the economy early on through the import of liquefied natural gas (LNG), especially since most operating and new power plants can also run on natural gas. </p><h4>How will the potential wells affect Lebanon's economy?</h4><p><span></span>It is already a positive indicator for the Lebanese economy to be able to attract renowned major international oil companies willing to take the full investment risk and work in Lebanon. Lebanon has the potential to find hydrocarbon resources, as the geological setup and legislative environment are conducive to oil and gas investments. Nevertheless, the oil and gas sector is by nature a high-risk industry in technical, economic, and geopolitical terms. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[lana-khalaf-country-manager-microsoft-qatar]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Microsoft has recognized the achievements in technology by Qatari companies such as Gulf Warehousing Company and Nakilat. What was the ground for this recognition?</h4><p>No matter the organization, Microsoft recognizes we are all undergoing a digital transformation. Nakilat has done so through our “Azure" cloud solution. All its data is now saved on a public hybrid cloud with Microsoft, which enables it to have 99.95% availability, full security, and a cost reduction of 50%. This will also allow it to focus on its business and not consume resources managing IT. Gulf Warehousing Company adopted the cloud in a different way; it uses it to bring smart warehousing into the market. The great thing about these partnerships is that we bring new solutions locally. At the same time, we are now packaging the cloud-based solution developed in Qatar to internationalize it.</p><h4>Ooredoo is also benefiting from Azure solutions. What has this entailed for the company and Ooredoo?</h4><p>Additionally, Microsoft has partnered with Ooredoo, the biggest telecom provider in the country, to bring Microsoft Azure hybrid cloud services, which will expand Ooredoo's offering and enable Qatar's organizations to gain major business benefits by transforming from CAPEX into OPEX. For example, Ooredoo will be able to use the “pay as you use" model, which is new. This will comply with all the data regulations and guidelines within Qatar. It is an amazing partnership and will allow organizations in Qatar to innovate through enabling this hybrid cloud within Qatar locally. This will certainly play a key role in innovation and application development because now with the change in quantum computing of the future and how the cloud is transforming business, having this hybrid model now for the first time available in Qatar will allow an organization to go to the cloud and have a spike in any application they need in a second and then come back and only pay for what they are using, which is an amazing benefit.</p><h4>Which projects do you currently have in Qatar to advance the country's education agenda?</h4><p>Microsoft's mission in education is to empower students, educators, and institutions to achieve more aligned with the vision of education in the country. Technology plays a crucial role as it equips educators and students with the right tools and capabilities to develop for the labor market, even preparing students for jobs that do not exist today. In Qatar, we are training 1,000 teachers with the Ministry of Education and Higher Education as part of our capacity building program, which stresses on embedding technology in education, addressing things such as developing project-based learning, using technology in education, and using technological tools. We also provide every student in Qatar with free access to Office 365 from Microsoft. Microsoft in Qatar has in place a program called Imagine Academy for students to gain specific certifications and be empowered for the work place. Early on, we engage with students and train and certify them so that as they graduate, they are empowered and have the right skills, certifications, and qualifications to enter the job market. Additionally, we use a fair share of our resources in R&amp;D and develop joint programs with Qatar Computing Research Institute, which is part of Qatar Foundation. Qatar is truly investing in education as it wants to become a knowledge-based economy, and this is an area where Microsoft has a great deal of capabilities and expertise to bring in.</p><h4>The government has focused on offering e-services to an increasing technological population. How has this benefited Microsoft's operations in the country?</h4><p>The Qatari government has a clear vision to move into e-services, which has benefited all IT companies in the country. Microsoft has worked with the Ministry of Transport and Communications to optimize costs for the country and accelerate innovation in e-services. We are developing a platform of e-services called Sadeem, where any ministry today can log into this e-services platform and offer a range of services to their stakeholders. We are also proud to have worked with Ashghal to improve its customer service solutions and develop its own CRM.</p><h4>Which major technological changes do you see being implemented in Qatar in the next few years?</h4><p>We are definitely moving into intelligent cloud solutions to guarantee full security between the cloud to the edge and the flow in-between. In Qatar, we see many technology advances coming in the near future. We see also hybrid clouds leading the future, as they provide the power of both private and public clouds at the same time. This is what we have done with Ooredoo, and most probably more companies will follow this pattern. The second thing is AI and machine learning. Data is the new currency and is key for the development of any country. With the flow of data, we will move toward e-services, business intelligence, IoT and smart city initiatives, in order to make well-informed decisions. We have been working closely with Texas A&amp;M University in Qatar in the field of mixed and virtual reality as well as drone and robotic technology. These developments will be “Made in Qatar" as a result of the support of the government and the know-how of IT companies like Microsoft.</p><h4>What would you advise girls who want to make their way in the IT world?</h4><p>In IT, as in any other business, the key requirement to be successful is to have the passion and the persistence. The technology sector has had male prominence, but recent years have seen female emerging and taking on important roles. Fear is considered as a major component creating hesitation among many girls from following this career path. From my own experience, by hiring more females and bringing them into our teams, they can make major differences, especially in engaging and thinking differently. IT works to develop innovative solutions, for which it is extremely important to have different approaches to problems and, therefore, diversity. My advice would be to first have the passion for IT and learning because IT is in constant flux. Also, females do not have to think of IT as pure technology. IT today impacts all industries and most things in life. Females need to bear in mind the broad range of ways of applying technology to virtually everything to determine what they are most passionate about within IT.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did the bourse's trading evolve between 2016-2017, and what do you foresee for 2018?</h4><p>Overall, 2017 witnessed relatively modest trading movement on the BSE. In the year's 242 trading sessions, 87 million shares were traded for a value of USD762.1 million, compared to 120.5 million shares valued at USD971.6 million in 2016. This represents a decrease of 27.8% and 21.6%, respectively, on the volume and value of shares traded. At the end of 2017, the stock capitalization of the listed shares decreased by 3.7% to reach USD11.47 billion, against USD11.91 billion at the end of 2016. As for 2018, we expect some improvement in trading activity at the stock market. The political environment and parliamentary elections scheduled for May could present some challenges to a better liquidity for the stock market during the first half of the year.</p><h4>Which companies are high performing in the bourse, and what impact will their performance have on economic growth throughout 2018?</h4><p><span></span>During 2017, overall market activity resulted in 16 securities declines, six advances, and six remaining flat. Among the 28 listed instruments on the BSE, the largest gainers were Ciments Blancs and Holcim (Liban) from the industrial sector, followed by BLOM Bank GDRs and BLOM Bank Common shares from the banking sector. It is important to note that during 4Q2017, all Ciments Blancs and Holcim Liban bearer shares were transferred into nominal shares following the issuance of law number 75/2016, which imposed on Lebanese companies the obligation of transferring their bearer shares into nominative shares. This transfer of shares has resulted in an increase in liquidity in these companies and may be attributed, among other factors, to the increase in their share price performance. In 2018, we expect a better performance for most of the listed companies because of positive growth expectations and an easing of some of the pressures from the Syrian conflict.</p><h4>What are the current listing requirements at the bourse, and what further amendments could be made in order to attract more company listings?</h4><p><span></span>Securities listed on the BSE are placed under one of the three market sections (Official Market, Junior Market, and OTC Market) depending on obligations undertaken by issuers and their respective levels of risk. Admission to any of the above-mentioned markets is granted by the Beirut Stock Exchange Committee after examination of an application file that can be easily downloaded from the BSE website. Likewise, issuers should submit to the stock market a letter by virtue of which the applicant is committed to the governance and transparency rules imposed by the stock market as well as by any other rules, regulations, and circulars issued by the stock exchange. Issuers must get prior approval from the Capital Market Authority in order to get listed. As general provisions, issuers of securities wishing to join the official market must have been incorporated for more than three years with a capital equivalent of at least USD3 million and have distributed at least 25% of its capital to the public, at least 50% of which must be held by shareholders. On the other hand, the Junior Market is open for newly established companies with a capital equivalent to at least USD1 million.</p><h4>To what extent should the existing Financial Market Law be modified to accelerate processes such as the privatization of the bourse?</h4><p><span></span>The Financial Market Law does not need modification, at least for the time being, as its articles have been drafted according to the most recent recognized international standards. The slow movement in the privatization of the bourse is due to the bureaucracy that we have in public administration, not due to the law itself. Although the process of privatization is not moving as fast as we need, the Lebanese Council of Ministers approved the formation of the BSE SAL as a joint stock company. It will replace the current BSE, which will be liquidated. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us a brief history of where Lucid began and where it is today? </h4><p><span></span>Lucid got its start in 2003 in London as a corporate finance house and strategy advisory. We were always focused on providing a one-stop-shop service for high net worth individuals (HNWI) offering investment banking services to their companies and alternative investment management opportunities to address their wealth management needs. Between 2003 and 2011, we worked out of London and Beirut and concluded more than 95 transactions in more than 13 industries. In 2011, we decided to get regulated in Lebanon because of our duty to contribute to the development of our country, the credibility of the Lebanese banking sector, and the richness and affordability of Lebanon's human resources. We started as a financial institution in 2011 and upgraded to an investment bank in 2016. </p><h4>Who are your main competitors in this space?</h4><p><span></span>We designed Lucid along a blue ocean strategy with a distinct strategic positioning. Our one-stop-shop approach to HNWI and their companies gave us a competitive advantage. All specialized banks are active in some of the services we offer, but our concentrated and personalized service to our clients shielded us from significant competition. Our differentiation from our competitors stems from our private equity engagement. On the corporate side, this entails giving critical assistance in strategy formulation to achieve growth; establish dedicated private equity funds to satisfy the funding needs of small- and medium-sized companies; provides access to global industry specialists to take an active role in the company's management or business partners and financial and/or strategic investors; contributes its corporate finance and advisory skills; introduces the best in class policies and procedures to achieve high standards of governance; and identifies, plans, and executes the best possible exits to maximize value. When it comes to investors and HNWI, Lucid provides access to bespoke deals; represents and protects their interests through private equity fund structures; offers highly transparent investments with each private equity fund dedicated to an investment in a single company; diversifies investors' overall portfolio; and provides higher returns.</p><h4>What is your vision for the company, and what kind of clients are you going after? </h4><p><span></span>Our deep financial and structural knowledge enable us to design innovative solutions and offer high-quality financial engineering. As such we have already successfully issued several instruments, such as corporate bonds, preference shares, and other mezzanine structures. Our clients are Lebanese HNWI at home and in the diaspora. Our strategy is to increase our reach with these HNWI who are highly sought after by other banks, and thus require a focused approach. To this purpose we are creating a suite of bespoke products. </p><h4>How are you approaching these high net worth individuals and families?</h4><p><span></span>The approach is extremely personalized on a case-by-case basis, which allows us to gain their trust. Coming from the same environment and having a similar background helps in that respect. </p><h4>Are you looking to expand your own operations into other markets? </h4><p><span></span>We are fortunate to be maintaining and expanding our excellent relationships in the GCC, Africa, and Europe without the need to have a physical presence in these countries. However an expansion through a second office could be contemplated in the near future.</p><h4>How do you gauge your success at the end of the year?</h4><p><span></span>Profitability is important, but being in the early stages of our operations as a bank, the main criteria are the quality of our services and customer satisfaction. We are working toward our goal of being recognized by Lebanese HNWI as their investment bank of choice.</p><h4>What other areas is Lucid looking into?</h4><p><span></span>Part of the new financing schemes in Lebanon will be PPPs, a major and important initiative for the country's recovery. This is important, not only because private money is being channeled into government projects but also because it brings much needed governance, professionalism, and transparency into the country. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What measures is the Ministry of Finance taking to reduce the country's escalating public debt?</h4><p><span></span>The public debt figure is currently USD80 billion. The effort to reduce this is a governmental one much more than a single effort from the Ministry of Finance. However, what we are doing on our end is putting Lebanon on track in the orthodoxy of managing its public finances. My team and I have worked extremely hard to produce public accounts for Lebanon from 1993 to 2018, and we are nearly done. We have a 2017 budget, and the government is finalizing the 2018 budget now. The main issue will be keeping the deficit under control. This is difficult because we see pressure on interest rates, there is a new salary and wage bill, and the price of oil is rising. We are also creating more confidence in the system. There is a significant level of confidence when it comes to Lebanon meeting its obligations. We have a long history of that and are proud of it. On the other hand, we are also working on securing enough liquidity, creating the required buffers in the banking system, making Lebanon more attractive, and helping our counterparts in the world deal with Lebanon. This includes legislation on tax transparency and fighting money laundering, among other illegal activities. All these were put in place by the ministry over the last two years, including a levy of banking secrecy on non-residents. Lebanon has moved from a non-compliant situation to being largely compliant when it comes to OECD assessments. Apart from that, there are the usual services being developed; however, those are details that allow citizens, taxpayers, and others who deal with the public sector to do so in a smoother way.</p><h4>The Minister of Finance has announced that Lebanon cannot request donor funding unless the 2018 budget is approved. Why is that?</h4><p><span></span>There are two points to be discussed here. The first is that Lebanon does not need to rely on international donor conferences; however, there is a major opportunity coming up and we have to make the best of it, particularly knowing it is difficult for us to find funding at the right cost for our developmental agenda, which will help the world cope with the Syrian refugee crisis. If Lebanon had not done so much to assist Syrian refugees, this would have become a much more global issue. Therefore, it is only fair that Lebanon receives the proper support for providing this global public good. We are seeking concessions on projects in our development agenda. Because of our efforts and everything we have been through; the world's attention is extremely welcome; we are thankful to the French government for initiating the conference. The reason we need our 2018 budget in place is credibility, because the conference will talk to investors. Being able to continue to produce a national budget on a yearly basis according to our own constitution is extremely important. This shows that our institutions work properly, and that public money is used in an appropriate manner and under clear rules. This is not a condition set by investors; however, it is the least we can do to inspire interest and confidence in investors.</p><h4>What are the Ministry of Finance's specific objectives for 2018?</h4><p><span></span>2018 will be a competitive year because of exogenous factors; however, one of the new projects the ministry is working on is petroleum. We have finalized the tax petroleum environment and everything related to it. We are working on having a proper sovereign wealth fund when the time comes and all the other legislation that is needed. We are also working on returning to orthodoxy in public finance. For this, we have the financial accounts and the budget. We are working on defining the new wave of reforms now that we have worked on revenue and the government has committed to not increasing the burden any further in 2018. We have to find the right measures when it comes to expenditure. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the construction sector performed over the past year and what are your expectations going forward?</h4><p>As a faucets manufacturer, where we are directly linked with the construction sector, we witnessed significant growth in 2017 throughout the UAE, compared to 2016 and previous years, where the construction market suffered a major blow due to the worldwide financial crisis of 2008 and major projects were put on hold. From 2011 we started noticing an improvement and many of the projects which were on hold were restarted. We have many more projects related to Expo 2020 that are due to be launched. There should be steady growth in the construction sector across the residential, commercial, hospitality, healthcare, and infrastructure segments. Going forward in 2018 we will see that the number of big-ticket construction projects moving through the pipeline will help sustain elevated growth rates. Similar to previous years, the UAE continues to top the charts when it comes to the construction industry. Investors are overall optimistic and have noted the ease of investing in big projects here.</p><h4>What role will Ras Al Khaimah play in the construction sector of the UAE?</h4><p>The construction industry is a key sector in Ras Al Khaimah, which is driven by housing, hospitality and infrastructure schemes within the Emirate, and also by its role in providing raw materials and manufactured components and many high-quality building items for megaprojects throughout the UAE and beyond. In many ways Ras Al Khaimah's construction sector is the backbone of the local economy here, with a number of major infrastructure projects enabling development across a range of sectors. The government is investing heavily to establish the Emirate as an international destination for tourism, which is driving significant development. A renewed focus on developing the tourism and industrial sectors has created a construction boom in Ras Al Khaimah and led to the development of a host of industrial, residential, commercial, and retail spaces. To support this growth, the government has at the same time invested in basic electricity, water, and sewer networks which in turn provides more opportunities thanks to solid infrastructure.</p><h4>What challenges is the industrial sector facing?</h4><p>In our business, the main challenge is the extra demand from the export market. It was not in our calculations and we were not ready for it. On a positive note, this higher demand highlights how the end users trust the “Made in RAK“ brand and Emirati production in general. Now, we need to leverage this higher demand and aim for more production lines and open more markets, boosting the kind of exposure we have internationally. There are high-quality products in Ras Al Khaimah, and we know there is a high demand out there from markets in the region, such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Egypt. However, it is important to retain a balance, and prioritize both local and regional markets in the GCC, Africa, and the Indian Subcontinent.</p><h4>How do you qualify the ease of doing business when engaging with engineers and architects?</h4><p>It is not easy. There is a lot of competition among suppliers to the construction sector, and there are a lot of brands competing too. Regarding engineers and architects, you need to engage with them from the very beginning, from the first stage of specification. After that, it will require an intensive follow-up. You need to build a good relation but also defend your product constantly. Thankfully, in the UAE we have good and well-informed consultants that recognize hard work and they appreciate the relationships established for future projects moving forward. Nonetheless, you need to attend as many exhibitions and events as possible in order to keep brand awareness high. Finally, architects and consultants focus on the design and the aesthetic function while the developers and construction companies are seeking the best match for the specification but with the best prices. At the end of the day, it is a long process from the specification till the supply. Certain projects can take up to three years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Compared to 2016, how did Bank Audi perform in Lebanon, Turkey, and Egypt in 2017?</h4><p>2017 was another successful year for Bank Audi. Within the context of persisting regional uncertainties across our pillar markets in Lebanon, Turkey, and Egypt, we adopted a consolidation mode, favoring primarily operating conditions and asset quality reinforcement over asset growth to further reinforce the bank's financial flexibility and efficiency. Notwithstanding, we succeeded in delivering double-digit growth in consolidated net profits, which rose to USD559 million, and USD464 million when excluding profits from discontinued operations, i.e. a net growth of 13% relative to the normalized net profits of 2016. This was a combination of great performances in Lebanon, Egypt, and Turkey, as well as across our private banking entities.</p><h4>What are your main objectives for 2018?</h4><p><span></span>For 2018 and beyond, we look to continue pursuing the consolidation mode allowing for conservative assets growth and prioritizing asset quality, efficiency, and profitability enhancements. The benefits of this direction will help us sustain double-digit growth in recurrent net profits without incurring additional risk weighted assets or consuming additional capital, thus reinforcing our financial flexibility. This strategy will also translate into an improved risk profile across entities, while further consolidating and strengthening our leadership in our home market, Lebanon, and our market positioning in Turkey and Egypt and also realizing our private banking business line objectives.</p><h4>Which of the bank's offered products currently see the greatest demand?</h4><p><span></span>Bank Audi has a comprehensive product and services offering that is well diversified across its core business, be it corporate and commercial banking, private banking, or retail banking. The most important development in 2017 was related to the newly updated internet banking platforms that provide customers with means to perform their banking transactions anywhere and anytime through a unified user experience. In two years, we have witnessed a considerable increase in adoption of those channels by customers, whereby the number of active users has increased by a third. The number of client logins on Bank Audi's digital channels have doubled, with 66% of those logins done on the mobile banking platform. The number of transactions has also more than doubled and now represents over half of the bank's movable transfers, with more than half of those transactions made on the Bank Audi app.</p><h4>What are the bank's key initiatives in the area of responsible financing?</h4><p><span></span>We have committed to responsible financing through the integration of environmental and social (E&amp;S) risk considerations into our credit decision-making process. In 2014, the bank developed an ESMS framework that details the process against which every lending transaction is evaluated from an E&amp;S risk perspective. This framework ensures that we conduct corporate and commercial lending activities in the line with the best practices in the field. In practice, the ESMS framework helps us identify and manage loans with potential environmental and social risks.</p><h4>What effect does bank exposure to sovereign debt have on the overall Lebanese economy?</h4><p><span></span>The effects of such exposure on the economy remain rather limited. Lebanese banks' holdings of sovereign exposure encompass Lebanese Treasury bills denominated in local currency and sovereign eurobonds denominated principally in USD. Given that Lebanese banks are not allowed to take any FX position exceeding 1% of their shareholders equity, we need to look at two separate balance sheets, one in LL and one in FX. For the LL balance sheet, the TBs portfolio of banks currently stands at 33% of LL deposits, bearing in mind that there is practically no default risk in local currency as the Central Bank is the issuer of Lebanese pounds. On the other hand, any exposure in FX in principle entails a default risk. However, the total eurobond portfolio of Lebanese banks represents less than 12% of deposits denominated in FX, while the primary liquidity in foreign currencies liquidity accounts for more than 50% of those deposits, which suggests a relatively limited exposure in FX. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[spurring-inclusive-growth]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is BDL's role in spurring continued economic growth?</h4><p><span></span>BDL is not only devoted to ensuring the soundness of the banking sector, but is equally dedicated to fostering economic and social stability. It has taken a leading role in stimulating the Lebanese economy through promoting growth and employment. To secure adequate financing in the economy, the BDL has long resorted to unconventional monetary policy tools by providing incentives to the private sector offered through banks. These have played a key role in boosting and supporting the numerous segments of the Lebanese economy: fostering traditional sectors through productive loans; developing human capital and entrepreneurship through education, research and development, and knowledge and innovation loans; reinforcing the middle class through housing loans; and preserving the environment through green incentives. The importance of these catalysts lies in their sizable contribution to real GDP, and their momentum in job creation. The BDL has also been focusing on developing Lebanon's highly qualified human capital, which is apt to effectively turn innovative ideas into successful businesses by creating room for new employment opportunities, expanding the country's GDP, and ensuring sustainable development. With the issuance of Intermediate Circular 331 in 2013, the BDL has enabled Lebanese banks to invest in the equity of innovative startups, boosting job creation, and increasing national wealth. The BDL expects this sector to grow strongly in the coming years, which will ultimately create inclusive growth in Lebanon.</p><h4>What is the state of market liquidity and capital adequacy, and how will they evolve in 2018?</h4><p>BDL has developed proper strategies to keep liquidity adequate in the Lebanese economy. Banks are enjoying high levels of liquidity that enable commercial banks to finance the government and private sector needs while maintaining a stable interest rate structure. In terms of capitalization, Lebanese banks' capital-adequacy ratios are reasonably high by international standards. In fact, Lebanese banks are exceeding the required ratios as stated by Basel III: the capital adequacy ratio in the Lebanese banking sector is currently 15.77%. BDL has been keen to reinforce banks' capitalization in a way that enables banking institutions to pursue their lending activities. According to international banking regulations, the lending limit of a bank is closely correlated to its capital.</p><h4>What effects do banks' exposure to sovereign debt has on the overall Lebanese economy?</h4><p>This is not a cause for concern. As we have already mentioned, liquidity to fund the economy remains available, and the banking sector is apt to respond to the needs of the private and public sectors alike. We are still witnessing surpluses in the auctions of treasury bills and in Eurobonds, a testament to the market's confidence in the Lebanese pound and the bills themselves. Moreover, lending to the private sector is currently twice that of the public sector, an indicator of a healthy banking sector. Private sector deposits are still on an upward trend, in addition to total banking activity. The Lebanese economy remains resilient and continues to grow year-on-year. Even if we are below our desired growth rates, we remain optimistic about the Lebanese economy's prospects of persevering and grow further this year.</p><h4>What does the new “Lebanon National Payment System" consist of, and what other technological advancements has BDL been part of in the past year?</h4><p><span></span>The core infrastructural elements of the Lebanese National Payment System are threefold: The first is the Real-Time Gross Settlement System, or BDL-RTGS, which offers a secure, reliable, and real-time method of payment that adheres to international standards and was successfully implemented in July 2012. It currently includes more than 70 participants, comprising all the banks operating in Lebanon, and any transaction settled on the BDL-RTGS is final and irrevocable. The second component is the automated Retail Payment &amp; Clearing System (BDL-CLEAR) for clearing retail payments, including checks, direct debits, and card transactions. The third is the payment system for government transactions (BDL-PayGov), which will be operational later this year. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[The Right Track]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[the-right-track]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How much has the company grown since it was established?</h4><p>Hawa Akkar was one of the pioneers in the field of utility scale windfarm projects. On December 17, 2017, the Council of Ministers issued us the first license as a private producer of energy, and this was a breakthrough. By this we had the right to produce energy as a private company, a first in Lebanon's history. Another milestone achieved was in March 2018, when we also signed Lebanon's first power purchase agreement. The positive aspect was that the government understood the need for the private sector, hence we invested in this particular sector and sustained all risks. With the two other ongoing projects we hope to be the first private utility scale energy project in Lebanon.</p><h4>What were the factors that led to the establishment of Hawa Akkar?</h4><p>There are three main causes for the 10-hour power cuts plaguing the country: generation, transmission, and distribution. In terms of generation, the biggest problem we noted was the lack of understanding regarding the resources at hand that can produce electricity. In Lebanon, the natural resources available in abundance are sun and wind, especially in the northern part of the country. We deemed it appropriate to utilize these resources and resolve the problems we were facing, which is what led to Hawa Akkar's establishment.</p><h4>What obstacles were faced during and after setup of the project?</h4><p>The major difficulty was the lack of government decision-making and processes to follow. There was no precedent, and when the government decided to go with the private sector, it did not know how to proceed and so it was the start of a long learning curve. The government is the main obstacle and the solution at the same time. Law 462, which was passed in 2002 to structure the private involvement in the power sector, and which was amended six or seven times, is yet to be implemented. There is also the PPP law, which has an unknown effect on the sector. Clearer legislation, laws, and processes will lead to more investment in the power sector and Lebanon would hence be able to solve its problems.</p><h4>How did you conduct the wind placement studies?</h4><p>We started with installing a measurement mast that allowed us to understand the available resources. In 2011, the government developed the Lebanon Wind Atlas to detect areas with great potential for wind power. We conducted the research and are still conducting more developed wind resource, environmental impact, and social impact assessments alongside topography, geotechnical, and grid impact studies with international companies. An annual bird monitoring program for Hawa Akkar has been developed as well and is currently under implementation. On this front, we are working with the best in the field in terms of advisors and support.</p><h4>What are the upcoming breakthroughs in wind power generation?</h4><p>The upcoming breakthrough in terms of wind and solar energy is the battery bank industry; there is more potential for wind and solar in Lebanon than what is currently being projected. This breakthrough will come soon, and we expect it to happen in the next couple of years.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2018?</h4><p>For 2018 and early 2019, I expect a breakthrough in Lebanon's electricity sector whereby we will see projects moving ahead in terms of thermal based power production. I see some solutions in terms of grid connection, which is the transmission network, and I see new wind or solar generation capacity. 2018 will only be a transition phase as we are talking more about 2019. I am more optimistic about 2020 and 2021 as we still face many hurdles and uncertainties that we need to overcome before we move ahead. We are on the right track, though we are not cruising yet. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Among largest private hospitals in Ecuador]]></title>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have you positioned your hospital group within the healthcare landscape in the country?</h4><p>We are one of the largest hospitals in the private sector in Ecuador. At the time of our establishment, there were mostly smaller clinics in the country. When we opened, we attracted many healthcare professional who studied abroad and wanted to utilize their experience in a large-scale hospital. This led to a scaling up of other healthcare facilities as well, so in that sense we were pioneers in improving the standards. As the first and only hospital in Ecuador, we have JCI accreditation, while we rank within the 25 best hospitals in Latin America, by America Economia. Still, we keep working on improving our standards—being the best in Ecuador is not enough for us. To be able to provide people with the best level of care, we invested in a medical prepaid company called Humana, which functions like an insurance company and gives wider access to healthcare. Still the healthcare environment in Ecuador is not that patient-friendly yet, with confusion over the role of the private sector and the public sector, in terms of financing this access. Our constitution states that the country—the government—will guarantee access to everybody, but sometimes the authorities, then, state that part of this responsibility comes to the private sector. Through the social security institutions, people make their obligatory payments to be eligible to healthcare. The rest of population has access provided by the Ministry of Health. The private sector does not get funding from that and self finance our operations is a must.</p><h4>How should the synergies between the public and private sector be enhanced?</h4><p>Three years ago, therefore, we had to close down our transplant facilities—as the only hospital in the country to be able to—because due to the system in place, our bills could not be paid. As a private institution, we should be able to invest in our healthcare, and provide it in return for sufficient financing. Shutting down our transplant unit was not good for the country—public and private healthcare should complement each other. Currently, the way the public and private sector interact put financial pressure on the private healthcare providers, which has even led to bankruptcy of some. Fortunately, in 2012, we managed to open up our agreements with the social security institute to put a limitation on our exposure under that payment structure. There is a new law under review, the “Código Orgánico de la Salud,“ and although people need the best possible care, but proper financing is just as important for sustainability of the sector. In the private healthcare sector, there will always be a corporate view so you can sustain your operations. That does mean, you cannot accept all patients for free, obviously. That said, we have a strong CSR program in place, and we do receive around 9,000 patients almost for free for medical consultations, in addition to 650 complex surgeries for those who cannot afford it. It is our vision to be conscious, to provide affordable care, while maintaining operations as an enterprise. The Ministry of Health should take care of the rest, one way or another. Currently, there is a great opportunity to improve healthcare, and we are happy to collaborate with the ministry and the other healthcare facilities to make this happen and to complement one another.</p><h4>What are the ambitions for the coming year?</h4><p>We would like to further advance in tertiary and specialize care, as we have the expertise in-house. In the short and mid-term, the road ahead is quite challenging but I do believe that in the long term, we can achieve our goals for Grupo Conclina, while also moving towards a better healthcare environment in general. The public sector is focusing on preventive healthcare, as they should be, but they are diverting some of their responsibilities to us. As a listed company with 2,000 shareholders, we have to maintain an enterprising perspective and be rational. The general occupation in the private sector is 65%, so there is unused capacity that should be allocated for the greater good.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[20 electric buses in Guayaquil]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[jorge-burbano-country-manager-byd]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What made BYD decide to establish its operations in Ecuador?</h4><p>BYD focuses its economic activities on four main areas. The first is electronics; BYD is one of the largest suppliers of electronics, and some of its clients include Samsung, Microsoft, and Toshiba. The second area is energy storage; BYD started in 1995 as a battery company, with triple AAA batteries. Five years later, it had 20% of the world's market share. The third segment is solar panels and LED light, while the fourth is transport, including electric vehicles, monorails, and a small segment for gasoline cars. BYD is a multinational company specializing in eco-efficient technology. The largest electric bus production factory in the US is BYD's, located close to Los Angeles, and we have other factories in Brazil, Hungary and France. We place quality before price. We also have country managers in many countries in Latin America. BYD trusts local talent; we can only be successful, if we work with locals. In 2016, BYD decided to come to Ecuador because it saw the potential in three areas. 90% of electricity comes from hydropower, and if we add electric vehicles we complete the entire green cycle. The country has high subsidies for fossil fuels; however, these are not sustainable. Thirdly, Ecuador was one of the most advanced countries in terms of providing incentives for electric mobility in Latin America. For example, there were no taxes on electric vehicles, 0% VAT and customs, and special prices to charge these vehicles.</p><h4>Could you tell us more about your projects for the electric taxis in Loja and electric buses in Guayaquil?</h4><p>The city of Loja issued a regulation that stated all new taxis in the city had to be electric. We started with 35 units and would be distributed by a public tender. We gained massive recognition for this, and people realized this technology is feasible for Ecuador. We then moved on to the buses in Guayaquil, which were especially designed for Ecuador. That was the initiative of a small urban transport company but was extremely visionary. We now have 20 buses for Guayaquil. This encouraged policymakers, and they started to create new policies. We have signed an MoU with the national government. We want to create a factory here; however, we need a sustainable demand. BYD requested 300 buses per year to set up the factory. Demand of conventional buses is 1,500-1,900 per year, so it is about 20% of the total demand in the country. We established a roadmap with the ministry of production to determine what is needed to achieve sustainability, such as 0% VAT and 0% customs for electric buses as well. We also made a commitment to work with universities to get human resources, technology transference and to bring buses to do test drives to convince the operators. Right now, we have a special electricity rate for the buses; we pay USD0.06 per kWh if we charge at night. We are working with National Financial Corporation (CFN) for a special credit line for electric buses. However, we need a national electric mobility strategy, such as in other countries. We also implemented the first public charging station in the country, located in Loja. We have 12 employees: nine in Quito and three in Loja. When the buses arrive, we will open an office in Guayaquil with seven people. By the end of the year, we will have 19 people. The company is investing in the country by employing locals and in total has invested USD3 million in 2 years operation. We are still missing the sustainable demand and are working on it. We have done well, because we have an operator in Guayaquil that is purchasing the electric bus fleet. In Quito, there is also an operator ready to buy 60 articulated buses to decarbonize a whole corridor for buses.. Most public transport in Ecuador—about 95%—run by private operators. Only one company, Empresa de pasajeros, in Quito is public, and the Metro Quito will also be public. This makes it harder to sell these buses, because private companies look after their returns. As long as the diesel is highly subsidized (USD1/gallon), it is hard to convince private operators to go for electric cero emission buses. Hence the Government should consider a support those bus companies that goes for electric buses, because they will help to save diesel subsidies and improve air quality in the cities  Ecuador should make public transport a country strategy priority.</p><h4>Aside from public transport and taxis, how do you envision improving sustainable mobility for consumers?</h4><p>Our cars have 400km range, and we need 28 fast chargers to cover the main cities. We already have experience with the taxi chargers in Loja, so we know what we need. We have noticed that even if electricity rates are low, the stations are not profitable right now because we have a small fleet; it will be a business if we have a larger fleet. That is why there should be a national strategy to include this. The promotion of both vehicles and stations should be done at the same time; l. The total benefit for electric buses is savings plus sales of electricity. For example, in 15 years these 3,000 buses mean a benefit of USD832 million, including the energy sales. We are a USD country, so we cannot print our money. Our production capacity is 300 buses per year, 300 direct jobs, a direct investment of USD60 million, and a long-term investment of USD300 million for the factory. It can be scaled up for the production of electric trucks. Another issue is that in Ecuador, that if a company has a credit line that is 100% more than its assets, it has to present a guarantee of 120%. For the past project in Guayaquil, the operator has assets for USD100,000, and the project is USD8.5 million, so it needed to present a guarantee of USD11 million. A local operator is not able to provide such collateral.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[tameem-al-shebel-ceo-saudi-mechanical-industries]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does SMi fit in the industrial localization focus, and what is your primary expertise here?</h4><p>I strongly believe that SMi resembles what a manufacturer should look like. The accumulative knowledge obtained throw-out the years by JVs and Technical Partnerships, the arsenal of state of the art facilities and capabilities (spread over 118,000sqm. in Riyadh &amp; Dammam) and most importantly the amazing talents that run the organization on all levels, all of these factors makes SMi fit perfectly to play a major role in the industrial localization efforts in the kingdom driven by the 2030 vision. In regard to our expertise, SMi is a fully integrated manufacturer, and that means a lot! To handle the whole manufacturing journey under one roof, where we can insure applying the highest quality control and inspection at all stages to obtain our clients' full satisfaction all the time, is what we do best. When you are dealing with sophisticated organizations locally and internationally, such as Saudi Aramco, National Pump Company USA, Saudi Electricity Company, or Almarai, you need to be at the top of your game, or you simply will be replaced. We have been investing in the diversity of our production lines. We consider ourselves the “Metal Repurposes" of choice, as we can create out of most types of alloys with high class engineered products and components that are used in many vital sectors, including but not limited to, Oil &amp; Gas, Agricultural, Water applications, Automotive, Firefighting and Valves. And with all the hype on Local Content, we can significantly help international companies seeking to operate in the kingdom with their requirements.</p><h4>How have you worked on development of the technical capabilities?</h4><p>SMi was founded as a result of a technical partnership back in the early 80s with National Pump Company located in Arizona USA, which leaded us to a success story that we still live and will only continue and thrive. This success story mandated us to follow the same path, SMi is now a licensed manufacturer for Johnson Gear USA, Rovatti Pompe from Italy, Arflu Valves from Spain. Therefore, SMi today is known for the high level of quality throughout the whole manufacturing cycle , in addition to the wealth of advanced machines that enables us to meet their requirements on time, all the time. We continued to build on that, and the more agreements we sign, the more we add to our expertise, such as getting into more metallurgies in order to serve the new industries that we sign agreements with.</p><h4>What is your involvement in the water management industry?</h4><p>Water Management have been our bread and butter as we have been in this industry for over 30 years. We are one of 20 manufacturers in the world and the only one in the region that manufactures UL-listed and FM-approved products. Our focus moving forward will be pumps for firefighting as well as the existing needs and demands for water solutions in the country and the region.</p><h4>How do you envision further regional and global expansion?</h4><p>Saudi market is the largest in the region in terms of current and future forecasted demands. After the launching of the Kingdom's 2030 vision, we witnessed a great deal of attention and interest from well-known international players in various sectors toward the opportunities that the kingdom has to offer. Most of the players that we had negotiations with always talk about the MENA region, in general. Saudi Arabia is working to enhance its competitiveness as a manufacturer as well as logistics and using existing demand to support creating more opportunities for local manufacturers. Most of the agreements we have signed (and the currently in negotiating to sign) are to cover the MENA region, and we expect more of that to come into the Saudi market.</p><h4>Is your scrap metal sourced on the global commodity market or is there a local supply chain?</h4><p>As a matter of fact we rely on both, especially if the local supply chain is available and reliable, as there is a local structure for scrap metal market. For copper, for example, Saudi Arabia is a net exporter and SMi is the largest buyer of copper in Saudi Arabia. There are more opportunities in metal in Saudi Arabia and the country is a net exporter for most of metals. Around 98% of our metal is locally sourced while the other 2% comprises virgin metals imported from refineries.</p><h4>Is there a great level of graduates specializing in engineering for your industry and do you actively get involved in training and development?</h4><p>According to the latest reports from the Saudi Ministry of Education, thousands of Saudi engineers join the task force every year, and we do our best to recruit the right talents that can live and embrace our vision and values at SMi. As part of our CSR activities we do meet with the universities and technical colleges to discuss their curricula and share with them what the new trends in the field are. We also invite students from engineering colleagues to visit our facilities, where we offer them a tour and a full day workshop covering different areas of production and the new technologies and their applications that are used in SMi. The output of local universities has been excellent, as Saudi engineers represent over 50% of our engineering workforce at SMi. Internally, we have a rotation program that gives the employee the right focus they need for our industry. Human capital is a major concern for us, and that is what we are building on in SMi. Everyone can invest in equipment; however, human resources, training, and development are a major priority for us, as we spend most of our time on developing and improving them.</p><h4>How do you envision further expansion in Saudi, with regards to the availability of manufacturing facilities?</h4><p>We absolutely need more land in the industrial areas to accompany the high demand we are encountering in the kingdom. The Saudi Industrial Property Authority (MODON) have been doing a great job so far, and are working on initiatives that should help solving this problem, one of which is to encourage manufacturers to develop new facilities in smaller cities, where space is not an issue. Though we need more land, we shall wait for MODON initiatives and evaluate them accordingly. Aside from MODON, the Royal Commissions and Aramco have also offered to provide land for industrial expansion. Currently, we have factories in Dammam and Riyadh, although Jizan and Medina also have excellent local human capital, people still come to Riyadh and Dammam to work. Currently, we are working on a land plot close to Dammam to develop something with Aramco and we hope that more spaces will be available in the near future.</p><h4>What are your expectations and ambitions for the company in the coming years?</h4><p>At SMi we live by our vision, which is to become “Your Manufacturing Partner." With the hyperactive mode that the industrial sector in Saudi Arabia is going through, which luckily is taking place at the same time as the fourth industrial revolution, we can only expect positive outcomes, as we are witnessing the governmental efforts and support toward the sector and local manufacturers, not to mention the increased number of inquiries from international companies that we have been receiving lately. Therefore, accommodating foreign investments targeting the Saudi market in different industries is our target. And to be able to accommodate this anticipated demand, we are expecting an increase in our technical and human capabilities to be able to diversify and serve other industries where future demand is expected to generate from, in addition to the ones that we already serve at the moment.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the measures implemented by the government of Kano to improve the economy since you entered office?</h4><p>It has been a difficult time for Nigeria due to the low oil prices, and the President was determined to foster agriculture production to reduce food imports. We needed to develop our internal revenue in order to develop our economy, and we had to reform the system by revamping the board of internal revenue, which used to be handled by government officials. That was not efficient enough and suffered from corruption. We created a board for collections that employed young, educated, well-motivated graduates, and we made it independent. We also established an independent tax collection body to expand taxes. As for agriculture, we held various meetings with farmers associations to identify farmers' main issues. For decades, agriculture was vital to the country's development; however, with the discovery of oil, people abandoned their farms to earn easy money from oil. In order to entice them back to farming, we want to create the right environment. Most farmers were not producing at a profitable rate, which discouraged them. They imported rice, wheat, and tomato paste, for example, at lower prices than what it took to produce. The federal government had to ban the imports of certain foods to protect them. We provided NGN100 million (USD275,000) for the purchase of improved seeds, which has increased participation. Another issue was with fertilizers, which was imported because of subsidies. It was scarce and, therefore, expensive. We  provided new machinery to a local fertilizer company, serviced its old ones, and built up new management. Now, we are home to the largest fertilizer producer in northern Nigeria.</p><h4>Why are sectors such as manufacturing, power, and infrastructure also attractive for the development of Kano state?</h4><p>In manufacturing, due to increased farmers' production and pro-agriculture government policies, we are seeking investors. In particular, we have encouraged the production of tomato, and there is now a need for companies that can process it into tomato paste and puree. For those who produce rice, we need more rice millers who can process it into the end product for consumption. Pertaining to solar energy, the federal government has liberalized electricity generation, and we invite companies to play in this sphere. To attract them, we offer free land to any company that wants to produce solar energy. The government will also pay compensation on the land and provide a certificate of occupancy for the land. However, we have to prove, beyond any reasonable doubt, that the investor is serious. Aliko Dangote is now investing in solar energy through our program, as well as one Chinese company. Another important issue when it comes to attracting foreign investors is security. In Kano state, before the advent of this administration, we had problems pertaining to Boko Haram. Now, with the current President limiting insurgent activities, we only see Boko Haram in a few parts of the country. Kano has benefited immensely from government efforts in containing the effects of Boko Haram. For the last few years, we have witnessed an increase in investor activity. We aim to ensure peace and stability; indeed, it is now a different story for anyone working in Kano state.</p><h4>As Kano approaches “megacity" status, how will it overcome the associated socio-economic challenges?</h4><p>A megacity is not only a city with a growing population, but also a city where infrastructure is working and the economy is healthy. In order to make it a true megacity, we have to look into the transportation system and road network. We have identified some areas that see a great deal of traffic jams. First, we have reviewed the master plan of the city; it was last reviewed 50 years ago. We have entered into an agreement with a consulting firm to review the master plan that will hopefully generate a better plan for a well-articulated road network, drainage network, and the type of infrastructure we need to provide. We are now developing flyovers and underpasses. Another problem that a megacity faces is unemployment. Due to a lack of electricity and sometimes the smuggling of cheap imports, many of our companies have shut down. The federal government is taking care of that, and we are also working together to improve systems; however, the problem of youth unemployment remains a severe issue. We have undertaken the collection of data on the number of unemployed and the type of unemployment in the city. In the short term, we provide skills to the youth through institutions. We also offer empowerment through different equipment. We have identified 24 different types of trades where youth can gain automatic employment if they are able to get the correct skills. Correspondingly, we are building a modern skills acquisition center in Kano for which construction is about 90% completed. Also in the short term, we have entered an agreement with Peugeot Nigeria. We lack well-trained auto mechanics, and we offer scholarships to 75 young people for one year. We also enrolled 100 girls and 50 boys to become automotive engineers. All 150 graduated without a single drop out. Peugeot will construct new garages with the latest equipment and technology in Kano, and our students will be qualified to work in those areas. We have even registered people who live on the street and are working on ways to assist them.</p><h4>What message would you send to the local and international investor community about doing business in Kano state?</h4><p>In Kano state we have zero tolerance for corruption. Many investors hesitate to invest in Nigeria because of the perception of widespread corruption. In order to enforce that policy, we created an anti-corruption body that is independent. It has a working relationship with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), and we have trained some of the staff. We are building anti-corruption offices across 44 parts of the state. We want to assure investors that action will be taken in cases of corruption. We also make business transactions easy; we have reformed the system for those who require land or documents and have reduced the amount of time it takes. We have also succeeded in reducing the time it takes to get approvals. We have implemented business-friendly measures and are now among the top in the country for ease of doing business. You can invest in Kano safely and reliably, and doing business here is doing business all over West Africa.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What do you want people to envision when they think of Dubai?</h4><p>The ease of setting up a company and doing business in Dubai, as well as its appeal as a leading tourism destination will continue to be strong pull factors for business and leisure travelers. In addition, Dubai's futuristic approach is also commendable. The recent unveiling of the Hyperloop prototype, which will allow passengers to travel between Dubai and Abu Dhabi in 12 minutes, as well as the testing of the world's first autonomous pods, are examples of the world-class city's commitment to a progressive and sustainable vision.</p><h4>How do you assess Dubai's progress toward achieving the target of 20 million visitors by 2020?</h4><p>Dubai seems to be well on track to achieve this goal. Over 15 million people visited Dubai in 2017, and the figure is rising. In just the first quarter of this year, there was a 2% increase in the number of visitors compared to the same period last year. Dubai's hospitality industry is expected to grow well beyond 2020 thanks to Dubai's status as a new hub for theme parks, a greater awareness of its cultural attractions, the spillover effect from the Expo 2020 and the World Economic Forum's recent ranking of the UAE as the second-safest country in the world, among other factors. In addition, the destination is also expected to see an increase in travel demand from huge source markets such as India and China as their middle class continues to expand. The recent changes in visa regulations for visitors from these countries as well as new source markets such as Russia will make a significant impact on arrivals to Dubai. New initiatives such as the all-inclusive Dubai Pass, which makes it convenient for travellers to explore the city's vast array of attractions and experiences, are also positive moves.</p><h4>What are the key trends that Dubai's tourism and hospitality sector needs to address to stay ahead of the curve?</h4><p>Dubai has a good track record of staying ahead of the curve. To maintain its success, it will be important for Dubai to focus on the development of infrastructure, addition of affordable accommodation options and broadening of its portfolio of attractions to position it as an attractive family-friendly destination. Dubai also needs to enhance its connectivity via air through expanding the Emirates and Flydubai network as well as via sea by encouraging cruise tourism, which has already shown year-on-year growth. This will lead to the further diversification and growth of source markets.</p><h4>What is your vision for the further development of tourism in Dubai?</h4><p>Dubai is not only the leader in the Middle East for leisure tourism, but also business tourism. According to Frost &amp; Sullivan, its MICE industry will grow by 7% yearly by 2020 and generate a total of USD653 million a year. We believe that travel to Dubai is poised to increase, and that our experience and track record puts us in the best position to serve the growing numbers of travellers, whether business or leisure. We look forward to welcoming more guests to Dubai and are excited about expanding in the city.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[mustafa-sani-sener-president-ceo-tav-airports]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>What role does Saudi Arabia play for the entire business portfolio of TAV Airports?</p><p>TAV Airports currently has one airport under our operation in Saudi Arabia, Medina Airport. In 2017, we won the tender for three additional airports in the Kingdom—Yanbu, Qassim, and Hail. We have signed the agreements, though we are waiting for the final go-ahead from the Civil Aviation Authority (GACA) of Saudi Arabia to start these operations. Saudi Arabia is extremely important for us and therefore with our partners, Al Rajhi Group, we have established PAN Airports Holding Group. This is the first private airport operations company in the Kingdom. It will be the holding company taking care of the operations of Medina Airport and the other three airports once we receive government approval. We will also have companies under the holding providing services such as duty free, F&amp;B, and ground handling. Our main aim is to continue to invest in Saudi Arabia and the region in both airports and service companies, though our growth is not just limited to such inorganic growth. Organic growth is also an important part of our growth strategy. For example, when we started at Medina Airport, the number of passenger per annum was 4 million, but today it is 8 million. This is significant growth and increases in passenger numbers are extremely important because every million extra passengers create another 1,000 direct jobs at the airport and another 1,000 in the city. Our service companies bring high-quality services to Medina Airport, and we hope to do the same at other airports in Saudi Arabia. In addition, our IT support company, TAV Technologies, operates the IT systems for Medina and Dammam airports, which also adds a significant value to the aviation industry in the country.</p><h4>How does TAV Airports take advantage of the goals set out under Vision 2030 for the transportation sector?</h4><p>Vision 2030 is extremely important, which is why we have positioned ourselves in line with it and established PAN Airports Holding Group. Privatization and infrastructure implementation are key for Saudi Arabia's further economic growth. The Kingdom's 2030 Vision opens doors for FDI and international trade. The country needs more roads, airports, and ports, and we can participate in this growth as an international airport operator and investor.</p><h4>How does TAV Airports integrate with other airport operators worldwide?</h4><p>It is about knowledge. The airport business is a sophisticated, international industry, and one has to know the business internationally, which TAV Airports does. For example, in Turkey 46% of TAV Airports Holding belongs to Aéroports de Paris (ADP), and we are partners with Fraport AG at Antalya Airport. In addition, VINCI Airports, which is another of the largest airport operators in Europe, also partners with ADP. In turn, ADP partners with the Schiphol Group. Therefore, when we look at these relationships, we are currently represented in one of the largest airport platforms in the world. With these operators, we handle 500 million passengers per year. TAV itself handles 150 million passengers.</p><h4>What are your main plans and expectations in Saudi Arabia for the coming year?</h4><p>We are extremely optimistic about and excited for the future of Saudi Arabia due to Vision 2030. Once we receive approval from GACA, we will immediately start to invest USD400 million in the three airports. We have already raised the financing and it is ready to go. Our other investment plans are for the terminal buildings because we want to add more passenger capacity to Saudi Arabia.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Saudi Food Security]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[anees-ahmed-moumina-group-ceo-savola-group]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As a leading investment group in the food and retail sectors, what is the role of Savola in endorsing the national food security and sustainable resource management? </h4><p>The Savola Group has grown and evolved, crossing national borders and affecting millions of lives across the MENAT region, and it is investing strategically focusing on the food and retail sectors. The group is leveraging its wide geographical outreach to influence economically and socially responsible behavioral change among its consumers and stakeholders. Therefore, Savola's sustainability efforts are integrated in our business strategy and they are linked to the group's core business objectives, competencies and expertise in the food industry. By the same token, and adopting the Saudi Arabia's 2030 Vision strategic objectives that entail ensuring sustainable food security and optimizing the use of resources for the Kingdom and to respond to the global concern of alerting amounts of the annual wasted edible food at 1.3 billion tons (FAO.org, 2016), we introduced “Negaderha,“ our food waste management program. “Negaderha“ is one of the programs offered by Savola World, the Group's Sustainability and CSR Platform. Through Negaderha, we are working passionately to decrease food wastage on a national level by raising awareness about the threats it poses and by adopting internationally proven practices to drive behavioral change toward optimal food resource management.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about Negaderha framework and objectives?</h4><p>Savola's Negaderha project is a food waste program developed to address food wastage as a national issue. The project works on conducting research to obtain an in-depth understanding of the drivers, actors and volumes of food waste in Saudi Arabia; and accordingly putting up an action plan and frameworks to create sustainable behavioral change with regards to food conservation and management based on the best international practices, which will contribute to the National Strategy for Food Security. Negaderha tackles food waste issue on different levels, and currently we are targeting two main segments of the society: the Households and the HORECA (the sector of the food industry referring to hotels, restaurants, and cafés) sector.</p><h4>Is Negaderha interested in forming partnerships?</h4><p>To effectively realize its goals, Negaderha is in collaboration with several international and local organizations. Speaking of this, I would like to highlight our engagement with The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), by which Savola utilizes their technical expertise and garners the buy-in of regulators and enablers to scale its efforts on a national level. Negaderha has also collaborated with The Waste Resources Action Program (WRAP), and through this partnership, Negaderha aims to acquire a license to use WRAP's know-how which includes strategic guidelines, frameworks and specific tools and tips on food waste management. We have also built strategic local partnerships and we signed MOUs with nearly twenty national NGOs that specialize in food waste management in the country. The main objectives of Negaderha's NGOs Alliance are to activate the partnership and expand on the competencies of each sector for effective upcoming initiatives and to support Negaderha as execution and operational arms in the Kingdom.</p><h4>How does Negaderha achieve success in reaching its target audience?</h4><p>Regarding the Household, we provide diverse technical tips &amp; tools that cover the full consumption cycle to include the main pillars that encompass the program: grocery shopping, storage tips, portion planning and leftover food tips and recipes. We have also conducted a number of promoted on-ground and digital campaigns to create better engagement and drive behavioral change within our target segments. Negaderha main communication campaign falls within the month of Ramadan, which is mostly associated with the wasteful practices. The campaign aims to boost awareness of the cause and encourage the community to embrace and practice the technical methods provided by Negaderha. Our most recent digital Ramadan campaign achieved a stunning success in accomplishing above 4000,000 social reach and it witnessed an outstanding social engagement and interaction. Correspondingly, Negaderha extends its efforts to the HORECA sector, as well. In 2017, and in partnership with Jeddah Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry, Negaderha produced “the Guiding Manual for Food Waste Management in the HORECA Sector.“ This manual aims to instill behavioral change, raise awareness and empower the business owners and employees in the HORECA sector by providing technical and operational guidelines and tips to minimize food wastage that may appear at any level of the food consumption cycle. This manual won the Award of Prince Khalid Al-Faisal Center for Moderation, under community partnerships- in December of 2017. Negaderha has also collaborated with some local NGOs and was able through this engagement to save leftover food collected from HORECA entities, and then distributed more than 1,000,000 food containers to 143,000 beneficiaries kingdom-wide.</p><h4>In which ways does research make a solid foundation for Negaderha Program?</h4><p>As an initiation phase of launching Negaderha, a field research was conducted to quantify food waste across Saudi Arabia by food category/item. The scope of this project covered the mapping and measurement of food waste in the household segment across the major Saudi Arabian's cities. The research included qualitative and quantitative measures, consisting of the compositional analysis of purchasing and waste behaviors. This produced detailed data representing the weight and the count of different food categories, top wasted categories and possible reasons behind food waste. Similarly related, Negaderha is keen on measuring the program's adequacy and performance. The working team conducted a Survey Research Project in order to measure both the community &amp; HORECA sector awareness about:  food waste as a social issue and the technical solutions offered by the program. A year after launching Negaderha, we were able to build a statistical baseline and we reported favorable responses of elevated societal awareness on food waste management practices. We aim to conduct these measurement surveys periodically, to enable us to enhance our project, and maximize and measure the social impact of the program.</p><h4>In your opinion, how does food waste represent a threat for the nation? </h4><p>The staggering amount of food waste not only puts food security at risk, but also spells out dire social, economic and environmental consequences. On economical level, and based on Negaderha research: SAR70 million is the value of wasted food daily in Saudi Arabia. Furthermore, and according to the MOEA report presented during a seminar in Riyadh called "Reducing Food Waste- 2016: “Saudi Arabia is ranked as one of the world's worst food wasters, the country is at the top of world rankings for both importing and wasting food where it maintains a high level of food wastage with 3,920,000 million tons thrown away every year and 28% of it is organic food, which is worth USD35 million of food every day amounting to USD13 billion per year. Realizing the amount of economic loss should propel a comprehensive national movement for change. Relatively related, the considerable environmental impacts of food waste including but not limited to: the contribution to global warming &amp; climate change, water depletion, waste of natural resources and negative impacts on biodiversity. Through Negaderha, we aim to raise environmental awareness to sensitize the Saudi population on the importance of food waste management, by increasing awareness of hygiene and public health to ensure people understand the impact on the environment, health and well-being in general.</p><h4>As a group that has a pioneering role in sustainability and CSR, what would be your advice to other companies and sectors?</h4><p>We at Savola encourage all the businesses across the various industries to be role models that personify sustainability in all of their business activities and functions, in complete harmony with the ecosystem to prosper in creating a better world for generations ahead. The collaboration between the public, private, and non-profit sector is also crucial in order to build sustainable development and drive change in a way that grants the Kingdom a leading position in all fields.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[New Legislation in Effect]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[pablo-campana-saenz-minister-foreign-trade-investment-ecuador]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>On August 21, a new law to improve productivity, attract investments, boost employment, and bring fiscal stability was approved by the Assembly. What are your objectives and expectations of this new legislation?</h4><p>The main objective of our administration and this new legislation is to enhance the dialog between the public and private sectors. In the previous administration, there was a big distance between the public and private sectors, as well as between the Ecuadorian government and our strategic partners such as the Pacific Alliance, the US, South Korea, and Japan. We are refreshing the image of Ecuador and strengthening Ecuador's relationship with other countries, at the same time strengthening relations between the public and private sectors at home. The new law provides a solid legal framework with international arbitration, in addition to tax incentives, ranging from eight up to 20 years of zero income tax in certain sectors and provinces. This has eliminated certain earlier obstacles for investment while opening new doors. For example, we eliminated the outflow tax for new investments and the windfall tax for the mining sector and are offering participation contracts for hydrocarbons instead of service contracts, which will open our economy and entice large oil companies around the world to invest here. Furthermore, we reduced the tax for the transfer of shares from 25 or 35% to maximum 10%, which has made us extremely competitive in the region. In addition, we changed the regulations with regard to countries considered tax havens; they are now welcome to invest as well. We eliminated the legal responsibility that used to fall on the shareholder or management of a company. These measures lead to more transparency, and if there is a problem with the administration of a company, the responsibility falls on the company and not on the last beneficiary of that company. This transparency, in combination with adequate international arbitration, is the new foundation of our investment climate. This new legislation provides a powerful new toolset that will do the country well, and it has already received great feedback from international companies and funds. During a recent visit to New York, I met with 24 financial funds that are now seriously considering Ecuador as an investment destination. These processes take time; however, at least the government has done its homework. It is now well understood that we are fighting corruption and working on transparency in our fiscal accounts. In 2018 alone, we had three major rounds of signing investment contracts, with 137 private companies committing a total of USD10.3 billion of investments, out of which 84 companies are already fully operational in the country. Finally, Ecuador is the only country in South America with the US dollar as its currency, which means that inflation and devaluation are limited.</p><h4>In 2018, you also assumed responsibility over the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Aquaculture and Fisheries. How do you envision integrating these entities with your ministry?</h4><p>The President decided to review the size of the public sector in a bid to better align responsibilities. From 40 ministers, we are now down to 20, significantly reducing the size of the government, which encourages us to become more efficient and lean. That includes transferring tasks to the private sector and encouraging more private investment in general. Still, the success of every executive, minister, or CEO depends on the team, which is our main focus right now. Bringing together the ministries of industry and foreign trade presents us with a unique opportunity to better align our public policies. Merging the two entities will better support our local industries to start exporting and build a broader export portfolio, which in turn should bring a more favorable trade balance. For the productive sector, we need to improve competitiveness, which means we will better assess the strength of our provinces and establish PPP models to encourage investment, rather than developing with public funds. Our mission is to create a state policy for production. Our neighboring countries Chile and Peru have managed to do so and increase their GDP growth as a result. We look forward to the same stability with private rather than public investments. In the next six months, we will present a new package of productive policies and laws to the President and the assembly. The merger of these ministries is at the foundation of the work that we have done here. Incorporating the ministry of aquaculture and fisheries means we can include that industry in our production matrix as well, while supporting it by opening new export markets.</p><h4>You have deepened bilateral relations with the UAE, and Dubai-based DP World has invested in a multipurpose deep-water port in Posorja. Could you elaborate more on this project and bilateral relations?</h4><p>One of our objectives when we started the new administration was to visit 20 countries in the first year. Thus far, we have visited 29 cities, including two trips to the UAE. We have excellent bilateral relations, and they are resulting in large-scale investment projects. For the Posorja project, USD1.2 billion has been committed, and construction is on track. The ministry is a firm believer that infrastructure, ports, airports, railways, and roads are one of the key enablers of economic growth, and we invite international investors to participate in these projects. Following a recent meeting with UAE's Minister of Economy and the CEO of ADNOC, we now anticipate another large-scale investment from their side. They are keen to invest in our Manabi Refinery, which currently has a refining capacity of 300,000bpd, though it has not been fully utilized in the past seven years. In 2017, we changed the concession model to invite more private investment, and the project will go for a public tender shortly. Apart from the UAE, we have received a visit from the Emir of Qatar, who expressed an interest in some of our investment projects. Our other main partners for our large public tenders are consortiums from Russia, China, South Korea, Italy, the UK, India, and the US.</p><h4>With the merging of the ministries of industry and foreign trade, how do you envision encouraging the local industries to start exporting?</h4><p>I am a strong believer that all our companies are able to export. As a dollarized economy, it is instrumental that we increase our exports and our FDI. Our national beer brewery Cerveceria Nacional (CN) recently shipped its first container to Spain, while the number-two producer, Biela, is about to do the same with other countries. Another project with CN that we support is the development of local barley fields, for which we encouraged it to invest in Bolí­var province. This is a small province, and the investment will serve as an excellent example of import substitution and local job creation.</p><h4>What would you like to achieve in the coming years of your term?</h4><p>The finalization of the FTA with the US and becoming an associate member of the Pacific Alliance are currently high priorities on our agenda. On top of this, we are working closely with the UK on a post-Brexit trade agreement. In terms of industrial development, we seek to build an aluminum smelting plant, a copper refinery and an oil refinery. Creating more employment in the private sector is another key objective. Current unemployment stands at 4%, which is relatively low, though there is an underemployment of 40-45%, which is something we are concerned with. In the long-term, I envision Ecuador becoming a financial center for South America. For nearly two decades, we have had the US dollar as our currency and have not fully capitalized on that. If we can provide the legal stability and framework and the confidence, then we should be able to become a financial center in the medium to long term—just as Panama, Uruguay, Singapore, and Hong Kong did for their respective regions. When we achieve that, we will be able to significantly increase our deposits. Currently, we receive around 36% of our GDP from these deposits, while the financial centers above receive up to 96%. With such figures, we would no longer have to worry about our balance of payment. The country has many of opportunities: hydrocarbons, mining, agriculture, fisheries, beautiful regions for tourism, excellent road infrastructure, 90% of renewable energy, a dollarized economy, peace and stability, great weather conditions and access to fresh water everywhere. Only legal stability and economic flexibility were missing and that is what we are currently working on. 38% of our exports consist of oil, and as the crude oil price increases, we have a positive capital flow. The national debt is only 56% of our GDP, which is manageable, especially given the size of our country. Starting from 2020, I believe we will achieve a stable 5% GDP growth per year.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[nuno-amado-chairman-millennium-bcp]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Would you give us an overview of the evolution and main milestones for Millennium bcp?</h4><p>Millennium bcp is the only private-sector bank listed on the Portuguese Stock Exchange. This clearly marks us apart from other Portuguese banks. We came from a difficult position, like many other financial institutions at the beginning of the financial crisis. At the time, we had a relatively low capital base and loan portfolio issues. Today, we have a well-balanced balance sheet in terms of funding and lending; we went from having a loan-to-deposit ratio of 164% to having more deposits than loans today. Second, we currently have a much stronger capital base of 12% up from 4%, and we want to continue to grow this capital ratio to obtain a larger capital base. Our non-performing loan (NPL) figure was previously close to EUR13 billion; it has since reduced to around EUR6 billion and is falling at a rate of EUR1-1.5 billion every year. Moreover, we have increasing volumes of new loans and business. There were several years when we did not grow our customer base in Portugal, although we managed to increase it in Poland and Africa. In 2018, for the first time in a long time, we have a net gain in customers and new opportunities. Our main challenge is to continue to grow our customer and business acquisition on a sustainable basis. We also want to work on the profitability of Millennium bcp, because we have an excellent cost-to-income ratio. It is clearly one of the best in Europe at 46-47%. However, we have to maintain and improve it in the future to ensure our capacity to generate capital, reduce NPLs, acquire more business and customers, and invest more rapidly in the digitization processes. We need greater digitization both for our processes and to change the way we connect with our customers.</p><h4>What is your strategy to keep growing and strengthen your position in dynamic markets like Mozambique and Poland?</h4><p>Our approach is to focus on our key, core markets, which are basically Portugal, Mozambique, and Poland, as well as Angola through a partnership. Our objective is to maintain a solid capital position in all these core markets, along with a quality balance sheet, while growing our customer base. This is a common strategy for all the key markets we are present in, though some adjustments are necessary in each market because not every country is in the same position in their financial cycle. In the Portuguese market, we have a critical mass as the largest private sector bank in the country in terms of business volumes. In Poland, we have around 5%—and growing—market share in what is considered a large market. In Mozambique, we are the key foreign bank in the sector, and in Angola, we are one of the top three private-sector banks with our partner there. We did a merger two years ago and are now better prepared for the future than before. We are extremely comfortable in the markets we are in.</p><h4>What are some of the areas where Millennium bcp surpasses the competition in Portugal's banking industry?</h4><p>We are perceived as number one or two in SME banking and corporate relations. The market sees us as number one in terms of innovation, proximity, and service quality. We are the main bank for companies that work in Portugal. On the personal banking side, we are also perceived as number one or two in terms of our service quality, products, and deep understanding of customer needs.</p><h4>In 1H2018, Millennium bcp reached a net profit of EUR150 million, a 67% increase YoY. What are the reasons for this, and how do you see the year ending?</h4><p>The measurement we use is cost-to-income, which refers to our operating profit for our business size and cost base. A cost-to-income ratio of about 46-47% means one has an excellent operating profit ratio. In the past, a high level of impairments affected this figure, and we still have a high level in 2018; however, the level is lower than before and our profits have increased. The main tools to maintain and develop our profitability are an excellent cost-to-income ratio and a solid operating profit base, coupled with normalizing our impairment level over the coming years. We are doing this very consistently, with decreases in our NPL book. We have also seen our business and customer volumes increasing since 2017. This year we will gain in net terms more than 300k customers, more than 100k in Portugal. On the other side, we also expect to see normalization of interest rates. Together, these factors give a reasonably good perspective for 2018 and 2019.</p><h4>What is the bank's approach to ensure customer satisfaction?</h4><p>We want to remain close to our customers and better understand their needs and respond to those on a proactive basis, which has resulted in Millennium bcp having the least number of customer complaints. Improvement is also a continuous process for us, along with ongoing improvements to our processes from what is already a great starting point.</p><h4>What are the main challenges of doing business in Portugal?</h4><p>It is difficult to do business in Portugal if one only focuses on the local market because it is a relatively small market in terms of size. The country has a great environment for business, with the exception of some tax rates that are higher than in other countries and the time to complete judicial processes; however, one can negotiate a special tax agreement if they are involved in foreign investment. Portugal offers excellent work and language skills and infrastructure in terms of communications, higher education, and road transport. It also offers a greater quality of life.</p><h4>What are your goals and priorities for Millennium bcp in 2019?</h4><p>In 2019, we want to maintain our excellent position with a strong operating profit and a further reduction of our non-performing assets and loans. We want to continue to reduce our impairment levels and improve our results. We want to make excellent inroads in our investment in digital technology and evolution, for which Millennium bcp is well positioned.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Lebanon’s Casino Culture]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[lebanons-casino-culture]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us some background on the casino and recent developments that have affected its operations?</h4><p>In Lebanon, the casino is a place where many gather to eat and enjoy a broad selection of entertainment, in addition to gambling. Our main revenue stream, though, is gambling, and all the departments are designed to serve gambling. Even when we host large events, we do it with the intention of maximizing our gambling revenues. We want to bring people to the gaming rooms. Casinos in Lebanon face many problems at the moment. Casino du Liban has a concession for 30 years, and we are the only ones allowed to operate gambling houses in the country. With only have eight years left in our concession, so it is difficult to find new investors. New investment takes two or three years to get off the ground. The second problem we are facing is the high tax rate from the government; the government takes 50% of the company's revenue. The number of employees at the casino is another problem; it is currently too high, and salaries are also high. It is an inefficient operation. Furthermore, the government is not enforcing the closure of small, illegal gambling operations, which eats into our legitimate business.</p><h4>What do you expect to occur in eight years when your concession expires?</h4><p>After the election, we plan to apply for another concession for a further 30 years. Our primary goal at the moment is to lobby for this concession. We also want to pay less taxes. This is a Catch-22 in that although we pay high taxes, we are essentially then guaranteed to the government approval for another 30-year concession. Beyond that, we also employ 1,200 people, so we are a major source of employment.</p><h4>Are you currently operating at a profit?</h4><p>When I was appointed CEO of the casino, the losses were upward of USD6 million per year. We finished 2017 with a USD3 million surplus. This turnaround was affected after only six months. We made a huge investment in the gaming rooms, buying new games, and enticing many high rollers. In order to attract them to the casino, we pay for their travel and accommodation at the hotel. We also host large events for VIPs, bringing people from all over the region. We like to host top entertainment acts from around the region as well, and this draws people from all over the area to our casino. Lebanon is a great place for tourism, and people like to come here and gamble.</p><h4>How much of your business is from foreigners?</h4><p>In terms of the population, foreigners account for approximately 20% of our visitors. In terms of revenue, this is close to 35% of our total revenue. Many of our high rollers are foreign visitors. We look to increase this group of visitors and have created a new department specifically for this.</p><h4>What new projects have you initiated?</h4><p>We are renovating our main restaurant and are planning many additional investments. However, we are waiting for the new concession before we jump into these projects. We could receive the concession in as little as six months. We need the guarantee of the concession before we invest a large amount of new capital. We are renovating a number of our theaters, restaurants, and halls currently. We are trying to bring big names in the Lebanese restaurant space into the casino as well. In terms of large-scale investment, we are proposing creating a big new room for gambling. This room will require a dress code, though it will be open to all. We also plan to start hosting an Texas hold 'em tournament. We are also keen to get into online betting and sports betting. We hope to develop an infrastructure similar to the sports betting infrastructure in places like Las Vegas.</p><h4>What are your targets for this fiscal year?</h4><p>We hope to reach profits of USD10 million this year. Even if we do not receive the new concession in the next six months, we will create a new area for bingo. This is a popular game in Lebanon for all age groups.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-very-helping-hand]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have the last 18 months been for Kafalat in terms of revenues, loan disbursements, and profits?</h4><p>In 2016, we adopted the IFRS 9 system. Taking all risks into account, it was the first time the company incurred serious losses. We had been accumulating profits over the last 15 years, though we never distribute these profits. We set them aside in anticipation of difficult periods and use them to carry more risks. We started with equity of LBP20 billion (USD13.3 million), and our equity is now over LBP100 billion (USD66.5 million). We incurred losses in 2016 due to the impact of the Syrian war and difficulties with Gulf tourism. Additionally, the oil crises impacted Lebanon significantly because we are, indirectly, an oil country. We have a great deal of remittances coming from the Gulf, as well as substantial activity in places like Iraq, West Africa, and Central Africa. Lebanese interests in northern South America and the Caribbean were also greatly affected by oil prices, the fall of which has been a burden on our markets. This caused ripple effects in other parts of the economy, impeding normal trade routes. We now feel more comfortable.</p><h4>What are the criteria set by Kafalat to finance SMEs?</h4><p>By giving our guarantee, we encourage banks to participate more in this area. However, we are also practical about things. We give guarantees to 75% of applications that come to us, which is fairly substantial. However, it is not only the financier who studies the file; we also go over the application and request for any missing documents or information. We make a relatively simple decision after this, because most of the work has been done. We make sure that smaller producers receive the financing they need. We give our guarantee to firms that employ 40 people or less as well as to start-ups that have high chance of success. The minority are start-ups, representing over 10%, while the rest are small firms. We support agriculture, high technology, tourism, and traditional crafts. Our criteria are largely banking criteria, and if the firm applying for financing has a solid model and a great chance of success, we are happy to participate. By forming a relationship with SMEs early on, we ensure we have strong bonds with the corporate leaders of tomorrow.</p><h4>How is growth in Lebanon progressing currently?</h4><p>Lebanon's economic pace has been slowing down since 2011, when the war in Syria started. In 2013, the slowdown increased, because we had internal issues and problems with Gulf countries, and the oil crisis further strained growth. There has been a slight uptick in growth recently, though it is marginal because people are still waiting to see what will happen in the region and country. The Central Bank's decisions, which have eased financing in a number of areas, might have been too aggressive. I suspect that interest rates will drop somewhat. People want to see how the new government will develop its policies.</p><h4>What does Kafalat provide in terms of tools for SMEs to grow?</h4><p>We provide lending guarantees; other forms of work are not our purview. As a partial lender, we cannot make judgments on behalf of the borrower. However, our staff and institution help other institutions that provide support for SMEs. We have, for example, staffers who work with the Tripoli Chamber of Commerce to support SMEs. We also have employees who run institutions dedicated to helping entrepreneurs in Tripoli and so on. We interact with many entrepreneurial societies as volunteers with the intention of supporting SMEs and critically assessing development across the country. We are able to use our staff and initiatives to improve the broader market, though we do not directly train any SMEs. By indirectly interacting with people, we are able to facilitate the expansion of their knowledge in ways that do not create any conflicts of interest. </p>]]></richbody0content>

What is RDCL World's current trajectory?</h4><p>We aim to build synergies between companies and businesspeople that want to invest in Lebanon and for homegrown businesses to expand into new continents. In line with this goal, we have signed more than 18 MoUs, ranging from Brazil and Mexico to Pakistan and France, and more. We have lobbied hard to maintain our stellar reputation and stress the strengths of Lebanese businesspeople. One of those strengths is that the majority of Lebanese business leaders around the world are entrepreneurs that started from scratch. However, although we are great ambassadors for individual achievements, our capabilities within a group environment become diminished. In light of this challenge, our objective in 2018 is to collaborate more effectively through our network of MoUs with other international chambers and economic associations in a bid to transfer information and knowledge, host investors, synergize, develop support from public offices on both sides, and conduct joint economic missions. The new trajectory is thinking beyond simple competition to complementing each other's work.</p><h4>Sovereign risk has always been a part of the reality when conducting business in Lebanon. How can it be addressed more effectively?</h4><p>Many of the companies we see today in the financial, industrial, and services sectors were established during the civil war where they experienced tremendous growth. At the time, there was extremely high sovereign risk but also high returns on investment of nearly 30%, and with high liquidity in the market. At the end of the war, people believed the risk would disappear; however, it has persisted, with new political tensions, regional tensions, as well as economic and liquidity crises hitting the country. The new reality shows returns at 0-5%, which explains why the country is experiencing low single-digit growth. International investors tend not to invest in a high sovereign risk country with a low ROI. The idea is not just to reduce sovereign risk—public and regional reforms must occur as well.</p><h4>How do you go about achieving the necessary reforms in such a chaotic environment?<br></h4><p>One major way was through the 2018 CEDRE Conference on economic development, which we lobbied for. We approached the CEDRE Conference first to attract and boost investment and to push funds through government support. All the reforms that were agreed and accepted during Paris I, II, and III were never implemented, and for that we need a complete revision of our economic, commercial and judicial laws. If Lebanon wants to receive funds from CEDRE, it has to revise and upgrade its laws and implement reforms, which is why we pushed for the conference. We do not just want the money; our objective is not to raise the debt ratio. We are trying to boost growth by attracting investment and reducing the debt through medium to long-term repayment strategies based on improvement of the GDP, and not by raising taxes.</p><h4>Will PPP investments be the primary component of renewed economic vitality?</h4><p>We believe in cooperation and coordination. In fact, most of the projects that we lobby for are PPPs. Another major objective is to rebuild the infrastructure. We are perhaps the only country in the world that has still not rebuilt its infrastructure 30 years after the end of its civil war. Outright privatization would face great pushback, and so PPPs have emerged as the best solution for Lebanon. We did see some positive interest, though a law needs to be implemented to protect the state as well as the rights of investors. RDCL World has in fact helped in drafting this law, though it still needs some refinement following actual application. We have to test it, and we need success stories, as no one will partner with a state without a successful precedent and encouraging insights. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[3 high-end projects in 2019]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[ibrahim-ibrahim-managing-director-mikano-construction]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Where are your main operations and from where does most of your revenue come from?</h4><p>Right now, we only have projects in Lagos and Ogun state. The idea of Mikano Construction came about in 2014 when I met with the chairman of Mikano International. I had been in Nigeria for around 22 years and had in my portfolio a lot of well-known infrastructure and building projects, he is a very well-known businessman and his company is one of the biggest in Nigeria and he wanted to invest into construction business in the country. We started the company and developed his own two private projects. Our first building was a luxury 23-flat building in ikeja, Lagos. After this, we built a high-end steel structure, which was unique for the time. We imported hot-dip galvanized steel from overseas and built a three-story building that had approximately 5,000sqm per floor. We were among the first to build steel structures high-end building, and it was a challenge because steel construction techniques are not well known in Nigeria. Steel is faster, more economical, and still allows for architectural creativity. When we succeeded here, the chairman decided to become even more ambitious. We started building a massive city in Ogun state consisting of eight warehouses of 7500m2 each built on a 120,000sqm of land as there was strong demand for high-end, secure warehouses in this area. These warehouses are the first of their kind in the country. They are extremely advanced structures. Our focus for now is the private sector and mainly our own private projects. There are a very few major government projects in the country right now, and we are keeping our foot in the door for these  projects when things turn around.</p><h4>What is the ratio of private sector to public sector projects?</h4><p>Right now, it is  100% private, though our plans for the future are to reach 50-50, our company is prepared to handle mega government projects because we have the equipment, the know-how and the reputation. 2019 will be a great year, and we are waiting for government jobs to start picking up once again. Our chairman is also a Nigerian citizen, and he believes in making investments in this country. He has invested so far billions of naira in this country, and not everyone is as dedicated to the long-term economic development of Nigeria as we are. We want to have a large positive impact in the country. The government sees this and appreciates it, and this commitment will be rewarded when the time comes.</p><h4>What projects are you working on now?</h4><p>In Karameh City, we have been working on our warehouses project. When we first started to develop this project, the land was a swamp, and we had to bring a huge quantity of sand to put into the land just so to prepare it for the project. This project is on the border of Lagos State and Ogun State. We are at around 70%, and we have built the steel structures for all the warehouses. The roads up to the level of the stone base are finished. By the end of 2018 we will have reached the first handoff point, and in 1Q2019 the entire project will be handed over. We have street lighting, security lighting, and fencing across the entire complex as well as a reinforced safe house for security officers. We also have land on Queen's Drive in the lagoon, which is an excellent spot. We decided to build a structure right on the lagoon. The building will be eight floor of super luxury residential space. This residence will be truly iconic in Nigeria. We are trying to make this building our signature project that can serve as a model for the rest of the industry. This is a difficult task; however, we are extremely focused on creating the premier residential space in Nigeria.</p><h4>What makes this project so special?</h4><p>The size of the flats is truly unique; each flat is a minimum of 1,000sqm, and the duplexes are 1,400sqm. There are few neighbors as well, and there will be only 10 neighbors. There are jetties that allow residents to access their homes from the water. There are swimming pools, and a gym and a swimming pool on the top of the building. Our competitors are constructing 30-story towers that have the same facilities we have for only 10 apartments. The access to the lagoon is a true game changer, and the ability to come home via the water will be revolutionary. These are mini villas essentially, and this is not present in Nigeria. Additionally, there are many gardens and green spaces throughout the complex.</p><h4>What other projects do you currently have?</h4><p>We have a third project that will begin soon, and it will begin by the end of 2018. It will have commercial and residential spaces. On top of this, we will have restaurants, entertainment spaces and other rooftop facilities. This is an extremely well-known area in Adeola Odeku street, and anyone coming to this area knows what to expect. We are creating the full package in this project, and it will be another signature project for Mikano. There will be nothing else like it in Lagos, and it will serve as the best example of what we can bring to the country. The project should be completed within the next two years.</p><h4>How do you assess the construction industry in Nigeria today?</h4><p>For the past two years, the value of the naira has been stable. Many investors left Nigeria due to the severe volatility, and the stability has made people confident again. There has been a commensurate improvement in the broader construction industry as well. However, we need more improvement. This country is filled with opportunities, though we really need to focus on unleashing the nation's potential. This is one of the richest nations in Africa, and we need to work to emphasize all the attributes that make us so great. We are so close to realizing all our potential. I am really delighted by Nigerians these days. We are constantly reducing the number of expatriates we employ, because Nigerian human capital is so developed. Nigerians are educated and worldly, and they return home to make a difference in their country. We are dedicated to utilizing this skilled population because this is the way forward for the country. The industry and the country are built on the backs of Nigerians.</p><h4>What do you expect from 2019?</h4><p>In 2019, we will have three high-end projects come to fruition. This will allow Nigerians to understand the true difference between what we build and what exists in the market currently. We want to see something special in 2019, and we want our name to be attached to projects that are visionary and unique. I hope to see these projects transform the industry in Nigeria.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Shrimp exports aimed at China]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[jose-antonio-hidalgo-president-ecuador-china-chamber-commerce]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the relationship between private parties and public interests in Ecuador and China over the past few years?</h4><p>The development of the relationship started in 2007 and continues to progress strongly. Apart from this, the government has a new initiative to open up to partners across the world. For example, in recent past, US-Ecuador relations have strengthened and Ecuador has opened up its commercial relations with the EU. As a country, the more we open up, the more partners we can seek out for investment or different loan options. One of the main reasons for developing these relationships is to establish a commercial agenda. Ecuador has developed an investment and project agenda, but over the last 10 years most of the relation was on a public and political level, with less involvement of the private sector. We believe the relationship should take a step in this direction, attracting real Chinese investment. Ecuador has around USD3 billion in FDI from China, ranking eighth in the region for Chinese direct investment. However, those figures don't match other capital flows that are worth around USD50.2 billion. In terms of the commercial agenda, we have limitations as a country in order to export to China. The basic limitations are the distance of 70,000km and obvious cultural differences. As a country, Ecuador can only export two products to China: bananas and mangoes. We do not have a trade permit for other types of products because the country has not negotiated this over our 10-year relationship with China. This is not predominantly a technical issue, rather a political decision. If a commercial agenda is put forward on the state level, trade could be opened up within six months. For example, Mexico achieved this and now their commercial agenda is an important part of the Mexico-China relationship.</p><h4>How do you assess the potential for continued opening up between the two countries?</h4><p>The Minister of Foreign Trade is doing a good job by opening up new markets and being open to different proposals. The Minister of Finance is also doing an amazing job by opening up different options for financing. This is positive for us because at the Chamber, we have around 300 members from various sectors and the export companies are looking for opportunities within the Chinese market. While trade can be improved on many fronts, there have been significant improvements. Ecuador's sales of shrimp have grown a lot and 50% of Ecuador's production goes to the Asian market, with the majority going to the Chinese market; Ecuadorian shrimp has grown in its reputation as a brand of excellence in the Chinese market. That is great, but these markets have to be grown through a strong, strategic platform that allows them to stay strong. We also have to diversify into other products. In comparison, Chile holds 72% of China's fruit import market and that market is set to grow over the next 20 years, up to around 60kg per capita per year. This is because Chinese consumers prefer imported fruits that come from Latin American countries, Africa, or Southeast Asia—regions that don't face high pollution levels. Ecuador should take note of this perception and look at how Ecuador's neighbors are working based on this trend. Ecuador needs to capitalize on its exporting strengths and the handling of direct international investment.</p><h4>Other than food and fisheries products, what other sectors are of interest for trade between Ecuador and China?</h4><p>We have to focus on tourism. Ecuador as a country has a lot to offer to the Chinese market in terms of another type of experience. Other countries have had their different agencies work together to create packages for Chinese consumers. These countries budget to attract the biggest influencers and bloggers within Chinese social networks to their country to experience it. Ecuador has to make use of the potential presented by the 100 million Chinese tourists that travel every year. It requires a strategy that works through Chinese social media. Therefore, you need public and private sector involvement to be aligned.</p><h4>What is the Chamber's agenda for the coming year?</h4><p>We are an institution with 20 years of experience and we have built programs for new business with China as well as import-export events. Also, we want our member companies to be prepared in terms of understanding the market perception and risks; hence, we help them with various tools, such as Chinese digital marketing training. Moreover, we hold various networking events with institutions and companies, and we assist commercial missions in visiting Chinese companies and trade fairs. At present, we have 90 Chinese companies that are looking to invest in projects in Ecuador. These Chinese companies are eager to network with the public and private sectors in Ecuador. Due to obvious cultural and language barrier, we do face challenges in attracting the Chinese management to get involved in our forums and networking events. In order to tackle these, we deploy “Ping Pong Diplomacy,“ holding table tennis games to break the ice and get people talking. In 2018, we are also holding an E-China Day because we want Ecuadorian companies to see the importance of e-commerce in China, which has grown by over 28.5% over the last year; we want them to know about the different kinds of platforms and options they have as exporters.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[This is Nigeria]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[falz-the-bahd-guy-rapper-singer-nigeria]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How challenging has it been to become successful and to create your own brand in the Nigerian environment?</h4><p>It has been tough, as there are many challenges in the industry. This is such a saturated market; we are blessed with an astonishing amount of talent, so it is tough for anyone to succeed. What made me stand out was my uniqueness. I have always been different. My music is typically hip-hop, but with a contemporary twist. I always infuse traditional Nigerian sounds and modernize them. There is always a story or message in my lyrics. The element of humor is also a constant in my music. There is a certain persona in Falz The Bahd Guy that I brought out: the funny guy and crazy guy. People started to relate to him and his music, and that was the breaking point.</p><h4>How important is the fact that you include political issues in your music?</h4><p>In the current social and political climate, it is extremely important because many things are not in place in Nigeria. We come in contact with these things every day, and as an artist, one is affected by the environment. It is impossible to live somewhere and not draw inspiration from the environment around us. Our voices, as entertainers, are perhaps the loudest right now. We are the most followed on social media. People almost worship entertainers, and we must leverage on this. That is the reason why I make conscious music. People need to wake up, and Nigerians are resilient people. It is an amazing thing, though it can become a problem when we become complacent and not react to things that are happening. People need to be more awake. I am currently working on an album that is all about conscious music, tackling our issues and making people stop, listen, and think about what is going on and how they should react.</p><h4>Were you concerned that 'This is Nigeria' would push a negative narrative about Nigeria?</h4><p>I knew it would draw some controversy, though I did not expect it to be that much, and it was a pleasant surprise. The more talked about something is, the better. It was time to say what is going on, and it got people talking. Many people mentioned it might show the country in a negative light; however, if I had kept that in the back of my mind, then I would have sugarcoated our issues, which was not the point. Things are truly messed up, and we need to wake up. If someone's child is doing something wrong, they will not sugarcoat it; they would try to say it in a way that helps them realize what they are doing is not right.</p><h4>What are the main challenges for Nigerian musicians?</h4><p>The main challenge is that there is no structure; we do not have a proper system of tracking records. In the US and the UK, artists go gold if they sell 500,000 copies and platinum if they sell 1 million. Here, there is no way to know how much one is selling. People on the streets have been selling records without permission. There are different marketers, and marketers have agreements with certain artists and pay them a fee. After some time, the marketers realized it was not working as well as they imagined. They then started to have a percentage split with the artist, which is more viable. There is still no way to track that. In a country where there are many criminally minded people, we cannot truly tell if our sales numbers are accurate. Fortunately for artists, that is not really a big market anymore; everyone is online. It is all about digital sales, and Apple Music, Spotify, and Amazon have changed the market.</p><h4>Is Afrobeat going global or is it just a short-term boom?</h4><p>It already has gone global. The coming to prominence of Afrobeat worldwide is unbelievable. Now more than ever, many African songs and artists are being played all over the world. I traveled to Iran, for example, and African music was being played; it is amazing to see. Something to point out was the big collaboration between Drake and Wizkid. Drake featured an African artist and got his first ever number one. The sound of the entire song is extremely Afro. Prior to that, Drake had never had a number-one song. It is a testimony to the fact that the sound is really in right now, and everyone wants to jump in. Afrobeat is putting Nigeria on the map in a positive light. When one thinks about Afrobeat, the first country they think of is Nigeria. The top Afrobeat artists are from here. Our music is one of our proudest exports.</p><h4>How can Nigeria harness this boom in its entertainment sector?</h4><p>The government needs to realize this is an important resource and find ways to invest in it. There is nothing stopping us from having huge festivals and carnivals; that is one way to attract people from abroad. These events are a huge tourist attraction and generate revenue. The government has not been paying attention to entertainment. We have generated all the revenue in the sector by ourselves. The government has not even helped in terms of enacting laws to regulate the sector and have a more structured industry. Generally, the government can play a bigger role in helping the entertainment industry grow.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the industry in 2019 in Nigeria and for yourself?</h4><p>The industry is going somewhere promising. I see many artists starting to perform all around the world, and Afrobeat is penetrating other markets. I see growth and an emergence of a new crop of talent. 2019 will be an important year. There are multiple A-list artists now, more than ever. Everyone is pulling out big crowds and making large sums of money. The sky is big enough for everyone to fly. 2019 is an election year, and we hope to find an individual who can take us to the promised land. As for myself, 2019 will just bring more music and more expansion. I am a multifaceted individual, and one of my aspects is in film, and I will be doing more in that regard. I want to produce my own feature film, so I am looking at doing something exciting. Our movie industry is growing quickly as well. I am known for comedy, so I want to produce a psychological thriller, something challenging.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You have recently been appointed MD of Mikano International. What is your priority and where do you want to bring the company?</h4><p>I came here to transform the organization. Part of the transformation is setting up the company to work as a well-oiled machine, to be able to scale the business, the products, and the services we provide to the community and the market, as well as expanding Mikano into different business lines. To do that, I needed to assess the current situation from all aspects, from how we do things, what is our market share, what people say about us when we talk to customers, and our strengths and weaknesses. We also have a lot of responsibility to the community, as Mikano is well-known for its CSR initiatives with schools and the police. We realize Nigeria has a lot to offer; it is still a niche market and a rich country with huge potential. We have to put the structure in place, then the right people in place, then train the high potential people that will elevate us to a leading the company for the next generation, and fill the gaps with external skills as needed. We are working to structure the company at a higher level in terms of performance and governance. Money can be made in many different ways—we have to have the right product for the right market, to service our clients better, and then make it affordable so we can stay competitive.</p><h4>How can you scale the business?</h4><p>There are many different ways. One is through establishing stronger presence on the ground like opening new branches. We are opening branches in Lekki and in Ibadan. Other ways by producing, assembling and selling new products here as well and also grow our existing businesses with high potential such as IPP, Gas, Rental, and Steel Fabrication. For steel, we created different products and are scaling the products to 20 items. Next year, we are going to double them to 40 items and will start selling and branding them. We also changed the branches to showrooms now. The branches were focusing on only selling generators and servicing generators, so we added showrooms to the branches. Each showroom will showcase all products but will be dedicated to a specific product depending on its target market. Our R&amp;D team designed new products that will enter the market in the near future that will capture different market segment and grows existent clientele. Also, we are expanding our businesses and entering new business lines next year.</p><h4>How is the portfolio of operations divided? </h4><p>The brand Mikano today refers to the generators. My mission is to make people aware that Mikano is beyond the generator business and is more for the entire power industry. We spent so much effort building the brand Mikano, and now we want to build the product that Mikano sells. From day one, Mikano has been number one in generators and has been dominant in electrical and mechanical work; our mission is when someone is designing a house or building a building, they think of Mikano immediately when they need to buy something.</p><h4>Is the generator segment still the main revenue stream today?</h4><p>Absolutely; it is 70% of the portfolio. Approximately 80% of steel manufacturing is for Mikano generators. The remaining 30% of the business is the electric equipment and the rental business. We want to grow all of this but Mikano is known for high quality generators.</p><h4>What are Mikano's plans to shift away from generators into direct power supply?</h4><p>Our IPP is basically the megawatt solution, which has provided for many clients in gas and diesel. Gas is cheaper for them, and they pay as they go instead of making heavy investment costs. The generator itself is a capex, so they pay from an opex perspective. We now have Intercontinental, NNPC, MTN, and other major players as clients, and Mikano is running on a gas IPP. The problem is the infrastructure for gas is not fully available everywhere, and this is where the government and the private sector need to step in. There is another liquid type of gas that is coming up and we are hoping that it will be available everywhere so we can grow the gas generator business.</p><h4>Do the low power tariffs make for an attractive investment, and how difficult is it to be profitable?</h4><p>There is always a way to make profit. Service is one of them, as are growing relationships with the client and enabling repeat business. With some products, we do not have to make high profit but the relationship will bring long-term and sustainable business for which each partner can grow profitability. Talking about MTN or any telecom, if we provide a big power supply, then we build a relationship and will have more than 1,000 generators being replaced constantly. The low tariffs are a challenge but not a problem.</p><h4>How would you assess the business environment in Nigeria?</h4><p>I find it fascinating and promising. It is the network of people that makes things move; the relationship, connection, and trust that you build within your brotherhood that keeps things going within your industry. Of course, the know-how of how to navigate through the challenges of the country is also a major success factor for us. If you live in a remote area, then it is challenging from every different aspect. I have never seen such an environment before but it has unbelievable potential because they know how to do things right and this country has so much to offer.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2019?</h4><p>I hope we all believe in the priorities and the mission of the company. I hope we all work together to achieve better customer satisfaction. One of the things I am working on is redesigning our customer interaction so that we are able to break down the level of support into three different buckets. I want to increase transparency and use technologies to monitor response time, resolution time, and eventually manage the performance of our employees in response to clients' needs and measure how productive they are. By having automation in place when we streamline the customer interaction, rather than silo ways of addressing the customer, we break it into layers and have centralized first, second, and third levels support.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[opportunities-ahead]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What measures is the ministry taking to reduce Lebanon's negative trade balance?</h4><p>Lebanon's trade deficit is currently around USD16 billion. There is a fundamental and historic problem with our net exports, which is that we are mainly a consumer economy. This acts negatively on our GDP. Lebanon has never had a plan to make its industries more productive and competitive; it has mainly depended on capital inflows from Lebanese people living abroad. This money goes through the banks as deposits and also comes in via real estate purchases. This has led to growth in our banking sector and higher prices in real estate. If this money had gone into growing our productive industries, we could have partly solved the country's problem of net exports, at the same time creating jobs. On top of this, the Syrian conflict has affected our trade deficit with our exports decreasing by at least USD1.5 billion over the last six years, while naturally exports should have increased. In terms of solutions, there are short- and long-term measures we can take. The short-term solution is mainly to give incentives to exporters through tax reductions that relate directly to exports, as well as incentives on the costs of production, such as electricity.<br></p><h4>Is there enough local manufacturing to cover local demand?</h4><p>It depends if there is potential for our local industries to develop; an example is poultry production. We currently import chicken from Brazil at cheap prices, so if we stopped that or raised the import duties, local production would increase, jobs would be created, and our GDP would grow. Nevertheless, some industries are not competitive, and we could not just stop imports. It all depends on the industry. At the end of the day, any measure we take has positive and negative effects, and we have to weigh both. The Ministry of Economy and Trade looks at three things: the effect the price of a product has on consumers, the industry, and traders. There is often a negative correlation between the interests of traders and industry. However, the weight is always more toward benefiting industry because it creates more jobs, capital inflows, and FDI.</p><h4>Which sectors grew the most in 2017 and which have the most potential for 2018?</h4><p>Growth mainly comes from the banking sector, though this should not be our target for the future. Usually, the job of the banking sector is to be the lubricant of the economy and help it grow by extending loans to industry. However, it becomes a burden when the banking sector is so big that it is no longer just the lubricant of the economy, but 50% of it. Now we have our McKinsey &amp; Co. plan for the economy. The government took the decision to create a macro sector-based economic plan for Lebanon to change our existing economic structure and turn it into a more productive economy. The mandate of the government is to define the economic identity of Lebanon, deciding which economic model we will adopt, and whether it will be based on industry, services, or both depending on our competitive advantages as a country. Then we have to identify the sectors where we have a competitive edge. We are great at marketing, high-end products, packaging, and some services, for example tourism and medical tourism. It is the government's job, with the help of McKinsey &amp; Co. because of its experience and third-party independence on the matter, to come up with an executable plan for the economy. Once the research is done we intend to create a strategy around every sector. If we succeed we will change the nature of our economy to be more productive. The major goal is to create GDP growth and jobs and be able to contain the magical number that is the debt-to-GDP ratio. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>We must not allow the devastating conflicts in our regional surroundings to veil the truth of the ongoing steadfast progress in our Lebanese national life. Indeed, nothing will prevent us from walking steadily toward the set goals, and from scoring acclaimed achievements in the coming short period of time. It is unequivocally evident that the period elapsed from my election has witnessed the revival of the constitutional institutions, namely the Presidency of the Lebanese Republic, Parliament, and the Council of Ministers. Subsequently, countless pressing laws and decrees were enacted after having been delayed during the years of vacancy and loss. In the same direction, the publication of legal and executive texts pertaining to gas and oil may, if coupled with the proper geological results, move Lebanon to a new economic era and turn it into an oil-producing country whose people live in affluence and ease.</p><p>Although I rest assured by the results that have been attained lately, my main concern is currently focused, above anything else, on the huge economic workshop ahead of us. I am determined to make it the foundation of the state's action for the years to come of my tenure.</p><p>As I say this, I am full of confidence that success in the required economic duties is possible and guaranteed, if the political forces represented in the government and Parliament sense how critical are the socioeconomic circumstances besieging the Lebanese society. They must join forces and demonstrate genuine solidarity with each other to face the crisis, and the Lebanese must show, each from their position, their willingness to make their contribution to get out of the tunnel.</p><p>My confidence in Lebanon's capacity to reach political solutions stems from my faith in Lebanon, with all the exceptional economic capabilities and potentials it is packed with, thanks to its geographical position, its openness toward the East and the West, and the excellence of the Lebanese citizens in the fields of science and work, as well as the authenticity of the internationally renowned educational institutions which have been in the country for hundreds of years.</p><p>Above all this, Lebanon has proved its credibility to resident and non-resident investors, in terms of firmly holding on to the fundamental economic rights and freedoms, namely the right of property, the freedom of foreign exchange transactions, and the unrestricted money transfers between Lebanon and the outside. Our system stood up in the face of all the storms that hit Lebanon in the middle of the past century. And here it is today, standing strong and sound, determined to support the desired economic progress. Its assets exceed four times the current GDP, it has a high solvency according to international standards, as well as a high liquidity, and it plays a major role in financing the Lebanese economy by ensuring the credit requirements in both public and private sectors.</p><p>Based on our faith in the future vision, in a country thirsty for progress and for accompanying the renewed global economy, the Lebanese state concluded an agreement with one of the largest consultancy firms in the world to come up with a concep to tackle existing problems and discover the strengths in the economy in view of extracting and deploying all the potentials and sectors in a drastic process aimed at the long-term development of society and the economy.</p><p>We shall not settle for the mere latent economic potentials or Arab and international support; we rather intend to accompany this with comprehensive measures aimed at fighting corruption and promoting transparency in running the state. This is not a condition imposed on us by the international community as has been rumored, but it is our choice and first aim, and the path that expresses our own convictions and our faith in the sound principles of state administration.</p><p>It is the path that we will strictly take at all costs. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[20 years of operations]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[tony-attah-chief-executive-officer-nigeria-lng]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How relevant is NLNG to the Nigerian gas sector?</h4><p>NLNG is perhaps the most relevant piece of the Nigerian gas jigsaw puzzle and one of the best-run companies in the world. We have been in operation for 20 years, though we built up our plant capacity from 1999 to 2006. Our vision is to be a global player, helping to build a better Nigeria. To date, we have generated over USD90 billion in revenue and paid more than USD33 billion in dividends to the shareholders and an additional USD6 billion in taxes to the Federal Government. We have also made a significant contribution to the environment. Before NLNG was created, Nigeria was on the ignominious list of gas flaring nations, behind Russia who is still number one. Today, NLNG has helped reduce flaring in the country from about 65% to 20%. We have also contributed heavily to the domestic gas space. Though many think we are only export market oriented, we got involved in domestic LPG, or cooking gas. Before we did so, the overall capacity was just 50,000 tons for a country of more than 180 million people. We currently contribute 50% of today's capacity of 500,000 tons. We will continue to push LPG into the country to change the narrative of around 100,000 people (predominately women and children) dying annually from smoke inhalation in Nigeria.</p><h4>What role does LNG play in your operations versus LPG?</h4><p>Our business is LNG, while LPG is a by-product that occupies only around 5% of production output. We are not just trying to make money; we are trying to help the nation by  eliminating gas flaring in Nigeria, eliminating the statistics of women and children dying from smoke inhalation, as well as bridge the infrastructure gap that impacts negatively on power availability in the country by encouraging use of LNG in the country. We have power plants but no gas supply, because the infrastructure is poor. The future of Nigeria will be largely underpinned by gas because the energy transition is happening. The world wants more and cleaner energy, which puts pressure in terms of resources. With climate change, we have an advantage as a gas business because the energy transition will accentuate the relevance of gas. It may downplay certain dirtier fuels such as coal, though in the end, it will have to be about the competitiveness of gas.</p><h4>Where does NLNG fit within the natural gas pricing debate?</h4><p>The price that matters is the market-driven one, though there is also our gas-purchasing pricing. For the domestic gas agenda, the government-driven price is a huge factor. The government defends this domestic pricing regime because of the lack of growth in the domestic space, while investors say the price is not competitive enough to be economic. There are two sides to that argument. Investors will say there are no off-takers, which is partly true. They want the off-takers before they invest, though off-takers want the gas before they will proceed. NLNG wants to intervene in that debate. We believe investors should invest and we can take it until the off-taker is ready, and off-takers can then start to follow the trend as gas becomes cheaper, cleaner, and more available.</p><h4>Can you tell us about the ongoing Train 7 project and the challenges in implementing it?</h4><p>Nigeria's future growth is in gas. That growth for us is Train 7, which increases our capacity by more than 35%, from 22 to 30 million tons of gas. We were number three in the world before the shale revolution, where America and Australia got involved and we fell to fourth. However, our ambition is to regain our third position in the world, which is challenging as the rest of the world is also moving in this direction. Regardless of what other countries do, however, we want to grow, and Train 7 has been on the table for a while. We accelerated from Train 1 to Train 6 but then stopped, and since 2007 have not really expanded our capacity.</p><h4>What was delaying Train 7?</h4><p>First, we did not receive much attention because of the focus on green field projects rather than brown field projects. Now, the government's keen interest and the alignments of our shareholders have made a big difference today. I must say that the stars have lined up for Train 7.</p><h4>How much of the capacity increase with Train 7 will drive local demand versus international?</h4><p>Most of it will drive local demand to position the domestic gas agenda. To unleash that capacity, we have to unleash the total development of the 192 Trillion cubic feet (tcf) or even the 600tcf. For me, the critical issue in the Niger Delta is poverty and unemployment. Train 7 has the potential to create more than 10,000 jobs in the first phase and 18,000 jobs overall. The social impact of more people being employed in the Niger Delta will help bring tension down.</p><h4>How can Nigeria monetize its huge natural resources and increase its position as a global player in the supply of gas?</h4><p>It is all about development. There are countries that wish they had even half the reserves Nigeria has, and had to shut down their LNG plants because they ran out of gas and had no capacity to grow. We, on the other hand, have proven that we can, through what we achieved with Trains 1 to 6. Now, many of the regulatory and fiscal responsibilities need to align in favor of positive investment in gas both for domestic and export. Oil has taken us 50 years, and the next 50 years has to be about gas. Nigeria is a gas nation that has some oil, so we must make that count, as the future is gas. Industrialization, agriculture, power, and petrochemicals are critical pillars that can be turned around by gas, and until we really strengthen the gas turf, these four elements will not contribute a big differential between the scopes of GDP.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2019?</h4><p>NLNG for 2019 is on growth and Train 7. It is also the year when NLNG turns 20 in terms of operations. In addition, contracts for the first three trains will be renewed, allowing NLNG to prove Nigeria's relevance in the global market. In the next four or five years, we are remarketing about 9 million tons of existing volume and adding about 8 million tons, so 2019 will be an active year for us. We look forward to it.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the most important advantages of having Dubai as a regional base for Medtronic?</h4><p>It has been a great journey for us and the whole process was triggered by the talent that we were able to acquire within Dubai. Dubai has provided a platform that allows us to easily communicate and engage with the healthcare programs around the region by being a hub that attracts many visitors and innovative solutions. The maturity of thinking about healthcare issues within the public and private sectors is among the best across the region, and we learned a great deal through these interactions. Through its location in the heart of the emerging markets, Dubai helps us significantly in ensuring we connect and contribute to the healthcare trends across the region and not only those of the Gulf or the UAE.</p><h4>How do you partner with governmental health and science entities and educational institutions in Dubai?</h4><p>We have been discussing with the healthcare authorities across the UAE and the Ministry of Health on multiple programs. These programs are focused on improving the quality of care for patients, delivering the latest technologies, and awareness programs. Having said that, Medtronic is also shifting from being a company that produces some of the world's best technologies in healthcare to a partner that ensures the delivery of these technologies is meaningful. The idea is that patients get the best technologies in the most efficient environment. Our aim is to improve patient outcome through controlled costs and improved accessibility to therapies without compromising on quality. Penetration rates and accessibility for patients are still at an initial stage, and there is a great deal more to happen. That expansion eventually means more spending and pressure on budget. Governments and hospitals depend on partners like us to not only produce the technology and the device itself, which has a clinical output value, but also to help them maintain an efficient process around the patient flows, patient recovery times, inventory availability, and so on. In this way, additional budgets can have the largest impact on the public. At the moment, the major healthcare challenge is to raise the standards of healthcare and improve accessibility without increasing costs, or rather while reducing the overall costs of care. Medtronic can meaningfully address this challenge, and we are driving toward what is called value-based healthcare in collaboration with the Dubai Health Authority and certain hospital chains.</p><h4>What are the most important trends and developments in the healthcare industry?</h4><p>Certain trends in the region have been to make the system more accessible, build more hospitals and increase bed capacity, and attract more talent from outside the country to address some of the clear challenges across the entire region. When we look at diabetes and obesity and take into account the bed capacity and number of patients per physician, these are much lower than what we see in a European or North American system. In addition, the standard of care still lags behind. The scarcity of physicians is one of the challenges that this region faces, and, therefore, it is important to see a higher output per physician than we see in a European or North American setting. Medtronic has had some programs in major countries around the region where we work together to improve the patient flow and the number of patients treated per bed or per physician. The region should now relook at its entire healthcare system and learn from the lessons of mature systems in Europe and the US. We need to build infrastructure; however, if we want to treat double the number of patients, we do not necessarily need to double the number of beds and hospitals. The efficiency of the system could be enhanced, for example by establishing centers of excellences, with high expertise in one location that can elevate everyone's skillsets. There will always be a need for certain general hospitals, though by establishing more centers of excellence around, for example cardiology, obesity, or diabetes, their impact and efficiency will be higher.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead, and what will be your main objectives?</h4><p>We have a roadmap with countries in the Middle East and North Africa region that we want to further establish ourselves in the next years. Every year we hope to localize and further our operations in at least two and possibly three countries. These countries range from Pakistan to Morocco. There is a certain level of maturity in these systems in terms of the availability of infrastructure and physicians, and by establishing Medtronic local presence in these markets we can assist in providing higher output. I would love to see us in at least two to three more countries next year, with fully direct/ local operations in the region. I aim at growing the Medtronic team who support physicians and communities across the MENAT region by 200 over the next 12 months. Also, I would love to see more programs of value-based healthcare coming into the region. We are already in serious discussions with funders and government entities in the UAE, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and South Africa. We are currently involved in the treatment of 4 million patients and aim to treat 30% more patients in this region. It is important for us to continue to challenge ourselves by asking our partners and customers to expect more of us. First, we want to set the stage correctly and make it clear that it is to the benefit of everyone to move into the value-based healthcare space. It is not only to the benefit of patients, but will eventually be to the benefit of the funder too, and that journey can only happen through physicians adopting the right mindset. Our partners and customers can expect more from companies like us and push us to the limit. Funders, partners, and governments across the region need to be aware of the potential of value-based healthcare and take our hand through the journey so that we can do it together. Any investment in healthcare that is made today will see a better benefit if it is built around that concept and will definitely become more sustainable.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the strategic importance of Mexico for Ferrero's regional plans?</h4><p>The plant we established in 2013 has four lines: Kinder Sorpresa, Kinder Chocolate, Kinder Delice, and Nutella. It also contains the first research laboratory on the American continent and outside of Europe, which demonstrates how vital Mexico is. The new facility cost USD200 million and serves the Mexican market, though it also has a strategic position for Latin and North America. We also want to explore certain new Mexican raw materials and use them to improve existing ones. Mexico is top 10 in the field of invoicing within the company. Furthermore, its culture straddles North and South America and therefore has aspects of both markets. What works here could also work in other countries.</p><h4>Ferrero is committed to using 100% sustainably sourced cocoa by 2020. What challenges are you facing to reach your target?</h4><p>We already have 100% sustainable palm oil production and 60-70% for cocoa production. We want to boost the latter figure to 100% by 2020. To do so, we want to find suppliers with strict quality and work standards because we seek to integrate environmental protection with decent work without human exploitation. We want to send our experts periodically to audit suppliers and help them meet these social and production standards.</p><h4>Ferrero Mexico expects double-digit sales growth for 2018, an ongoing trend for the last several years. What factors are behind this?</h4><p>Ferrero has excellent products and competent personnel in terms of professional training and ability to work with others. We want to create a company where knowledge, accountability, and empowerment form the basis and only increase with time. On the other hand, we have a product that sees great demand. Behind our desired products, there is a research effort to understand the needs of the consumer. This manifests the respect we have for consumers' preferences.</p><h4>What future investments do you have in the pipeline for the country?</h4><p>The projects are confidential, though we are exploring the possibility of extending our local production capacity. We are analyzing whether it is appropriate to do it now or wait a few months. We also have a development plan for the business in Mexico, and our existing plant may grow in production in the coming years.</p><h4>Nearly half of your local production is exported to the US and Canada. How might NAFTA renegotiations impact your export strategy?</h4><p>We must comply with government decisions. We are definitely in favor of NAFTA and would be pleased if a favorable negotiation is achieved. Otherwise, we have our Plan B—one must always be prepared. As a resilient company, Ferrero has to be ready to face crises, as it has done in other markets in the past.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2018?</h4><p>We want to stabilize the launch of Kinder Delice Strawberry, which got off the ground in September 2017. The first months are chaotic because it entails execution, consumer perceptions, and other variables that complicate the process. The first months after the stabilization period help us understand the potential of the project and what does and does not work. We want to continue to grow as a product, conducting tests on possible future releases for the coming years. After the earthquake, we were worried about our Mexican people and what we could do to help them. We are in the third phase of a project to bring hope to our Mexican brothers. With the money collected during our Christmas concert, in addition to an amount the company will donate, we will support a reconstruction project.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Strategy 2020 Underway]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[omar-hariri-ceo-saudia-cargo]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some Saudia Cargo's main strengths, and what things might be done differently under your leadership?</h4><p>Saudia Cargo ranks among the world's leading airfreight carriers, and has left an indelible mark on the Middle East as it was the first to venture in this industry. We are uniquely positioned to provide a bridge between East and West via a wide global network and our three main hubs in Saudi Arabia. This gives us a unique competitive edge with increased flexibility, allowing us to move cargo with minimal handling time. We are currently undergoing an organizational transformation. Our strategy is in support of the Kingdom's Vision 2030 to make Saudi Arabia a leading freight and logistics hub for the region by leveraging its geographic position. In line with that, my aim is to focus on our five main strategic pillars: safety and security, service quality, people, customer experience, and profitable growth.</p><h4>Can you elaborate more on the five strategic pillars?</h4><p>In terms of our people pillar, Saudia Cargo recently signed with Gallup to drive a culture change of customer focus and performance. We also signed with Saudi Civil Aviation Academy (SACA) and National Training Centre for Facilities and Hospitality Management (NTC FHM) to impart training. We create personal KPIs to drive performance and efficiency in every position. Customer experience is our major focus. We have reformed the sales force and our customer service department and introduced new products in line with customers' needs. We also promote a customer-centric culture within the organization in addition to setting a customer journey action plan. In our safety and security pillar, compliance with external audits and certifications such as Transported Asset Protection Association (TAPA), as well as various International Air Transport Association (IATA) models will keep us on the correct trajectory. (and others was a major step) In addition, it is one of our goals to successfully complete the new  IATA Safety Audit for Ground Operations (ISAGO) framework as well as the British Standards Institution - BSI - ISO Suite - ISO 9001 Quality, ISO 45001 Safety &amp; Health management, and ISO 14001 environment management certifications. In terms of service quality, an important pillar, we focused on is that of upgrading the cargo IQ performance, re-engineering primary processes, and introducing new KPIs. We have introduced a HUB control center and will be developing this concept further as well as launched a new temperature control facility in both Riyadh and Jeddah. We have also reformed our quality, health, safety, security, and environment (QHSSE) department. Under the profitable growth pillar, we achieved a healthy increase in yield and implemented new revenue management systems that have resulted in a very healthy growth in net profits in the last few months.</p><h4>The flip side to privatization across the industry has been the loosening of regulations and the introduction of foreign competitors. Is this market disruption healthy for the industry?</h4><p>Competition is inevitable in an open market. We view it as motivation to become better in what we do and in driving better service to our customers. According to a Boeing analysis, in the coming 20 years, air cargo traffic will grow 4.2% annually. Overall, world air cargo traffic will increase from 223 billion revenue ton kilometers (RTK) in 2015 to 509 billion RTK in 2035. As far as Saudia Cargo is concerned, our Strategy 2020 initiative will make us more than ready to take on competition from around the world.</p><h4>Technology has been driving the goals of Vision 2030 across the economy. How is Saudi Cargo adopting technological solutions to further its goals?</h4><p>Technology enables transparency and makes transactions faster in different industries. The airfreight industry benefits significantly from this, as customers are able to track shipments in real time and draw our attention to any problems. At the same time, it makes booking easier and faster. This is transparency at its best, and we intend to invest further on our IT infrastructure for the benefit of our customers. Saudia Cargo is digitalizing the transformation to enhance our customer experience. The world has become smaller, and it is now heavily dependent on technology. Whether we like it or not, the digital age will catch up with the airfreight industry. The fourth industrial revolution, generally known as Industry 4.0, is already here, and the earlier we embrace technological advancements, the better.</p><h4>Another key part of the Vision is vocational and in-house training or human resource development in tandem with localizing the workforce. How has Saudia Cargo invested in this area?</h4><p>Training is an essential pillar of our strategy. For example, we partnered with Gallup, the world's leading performance management consultant, to redesign our company culture to a more customer-centric focus approach. In addition, in April, we also signed an agreement with SACA and NTCFHM to train 873 employees in various aspects of airfreight and logistic operations. This training partnership will cover wide-ranging areas, including airport security, operational safety, GACA's by-laws and regulations, the rules of airfields, dangerous goods, plans to respond to emergency situations, airfreight terminology, and others. A total of 558 courses will be offered during this two-year partnership. Our Transformation plan is in line with the Kingdom's Vision 2030, which calls for more support to the labor market by improving their skills and knowledge at different levels. This is the Kingdom's investment in the future and we are a key part of it.</p><h4>What are some of your goals and ambitions for 2018 and in the longer term?</h4><p>My goals include transformation by 2020 that will eventually cater to Vision 2030. I focus on investing in our IT capabilities, people, machinery/equipment, and facilities. Saudia Cargo is heavily investing in infrastructural development. We have signed agreements with three major companies to construct a new cargo handling facility with a total investment of SAR1.4 billion (USD373.5 million) for both Jeddah and Riyadh. The current 35,000sqm facility at Jeddah's King Abdul Aziz International Airport (KAIA) will be upgraded to a 75,000sqm state-of-the-art cargo handling facility with special focus on cold chain, pharmaceutical, and dangerous goods handling. The first phase of the project will start in September 2018 and is expected to end in November 2019, while the second phase begins June 2020 and ends December 2021. Riyadh's King Khalid International Airport facility will be fully refurbished in phases, with a new 23,600-sqm unit with special focus on e-commerce and special handling. In 2018, we also inaugurated the cold storage facility for medical and pharmaceutical products at KAIA Cargo Terminal to meet the increasing demand for temperature-controlled shipments. The refrigerated warehouse was opened in conjunction with the launch of FlyPharma, a product designed specifically to meet the growing demand for the pharmaceutical and life sciences sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does DRC's new site at Dubai Investment Park enable the company to meet the requirements of the industry and maintain an edge over its competitors?</h4><p>Moving to our new site gave us the capability to start producing two new products—Aquafina and Lipton Ice Tea. It also enabled us to produce our product range in significantly larger quantities. Another benefit is that with newer equipment, we can produce more efficiently, using less energy and water. The new infrastructure also allows us to open up new lines of business. For example, we signed an agreement with Froneri Ice Cream Egypt in 2017 to distribute Nestlé ice cream. We are continuing to expand and are in talks with several parties to add further lines of business.</p><h4>Which F&amp;B segments do you target in particular?</h4><p>We are always interested in the beverage segment. Our partner is PepsiCo which has a wide product portfolio, and we have ongoing discussions with PepsiCo to expand the range available in the UAE. On the food side, we focus on packaged products where we have synergies with the products we sell for PepsiCo. One of the things we recently launched is a range of snacks called Snack Time that sell in the same channels where we sell our beverages. We look for new products that maximize the synergies with our existing product portfolio and that we can sell through the distribution channels in which we are already strong.</p><h4>What are the main innovations that have been incorporated into new facilities?</h4><p>Innovation comes in different forms. Sometimes it is in the new products and packages that we launch. There is also innovation in terms of how we go to market. There can be things that are less visible, such as efficiency, services, or logistics and storage. Often for an industry, innovation is more about these types of operational improvements rather than just about launching new products. It is important for us to improve our level of service through innovation; for example, we have programs that improve our distribution routes. We also innovate in our manufacturing processes to use fewer and more lightweight materials to save money. We innovate in terms of quality control to ensure that every product our customers get is of exactly the same high quality, with no failures. We have even incorporated innovation into the building and its management. We are currently awarding the job of installing solar panels over 60,000sqm of roof, which will generate almost 4MW of power. This will be one of the largest solar installations of its kind in Dubai.</p><h4>What strengths and competitive advantages make you an attractive partner for businesses that want to establish their brands in the UAE market?</h4><p>We have some tremendous advantages in terms of both manufacturing and distribution. DRC is one of the strongest distribution companies in the UAE in terms of coverage breadth and depth. We perhaps reach more customers in our territory than anyone in the FMCG business. Moreover, we reach customers more frequently than anyone else which help us deliver a superior service level. We can also execute marketing activities in a way that companies with more limited capabilities cannot. DRC is certainly one of the top companies in the UAE in terms of distribution and execution. In terms of manufacturing, we represent a tremendous opportunity for companies coming from Europe, the US, and other places that currently have their supply chain coming out of their home countries or regions. Generally speaking, these big markets do not have the flexibility to produce specifically for the Middle East market. Often by the time products arrive to the UAE, a significant portion of the shelf life has expired. Hence, supplying Middle East from the US or Europe add many complications. DRC can do the job here; our infrastructure is ready and we are plug and play. We can set up a customer-designed manufacturing process quickly, efficiently, and at great value for money We are happy to sign long-term contracts with serious partners.</p><h4>What is your international strategy, and do you see room for consolidation in the F&amp;B sector in the region?</h4><p>DRC currently exports to over 30 countries, though we do not have on-the-ground support in other countries. We look to continue expanding our exports, despite the fact it is becoming more challenging. As other countries build their own capabilities there are less opportunities for exports of soft drinks. What we can do is expand the range of products we offer them. I expect consolidation to happen in the soft drinks industry in the Middle East, as a result of the introduction of excise taxes in October 2017. The tax has had a tremendous impact on the industry, with the industry size decreasing dramatically. Profitability has been impacted for all soft drink suppliers. The reduced industry size will lead to consolidation despite many challenges that face these efforts.</p><h4>Are you looking to move into health-positioned drinks?</h4><p>We are looking at all kinds of beverages where we see a significant market opportunity, not specifically health-oriented drinks. We are primarily interested in significant business opportunities we can go after, and if healthy products present this we will go after them. People with a more international outlook like to talk about healthy products and trends, though the heart of the matter is what consumers want and they want indulgence. We have a range of healthy products, such as low-sugar and diet drinks, water, and tea, though many people still prefer full-sugar products. We have no lack of healthy products offerings, and if we see an opportunity we will increase our offering in this space.</p><h4>How do you assess the competitiveness of the UAE's F&amp;B manufacturing sector, and what are the most important challenges and opportunities going forward?</h4><p>In general, the UAE is extremely competitive when it comes to services, infrastructure, and trading facilities. However, it is not particularly competitive as an industrial hub. The cost of doing business in the UAE is high, which is not great for manufacturers. DRC has been here for a long time and will continue to expand and to benefit from, government policies, from great infrastructure and from the safety and security in the UAE. These factors are all huge benefits, which help offset the high cost of doing business. We are also moving from a mostly unregulated economy to a regulated system and from a basically tax-free system to a new tax environment These are significant changes that need to be managed well in order to succeed over the long term.</p><h4>What will be the main drivers for growth for DRC in the medium to long term?</h4><p>The first thing we have to deal with is the new tax regulations. It is important we reset our business model to deal with this. This is a significant and adverse development. Secondly, we have to start moving relatively quickly to build new businesses. For 60 years, we basically had one business—soft drinks. Now, we are diversifying our business to soften the impact of the tax changes. We are looking at beverages, new products and new business relationships.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Among 25 best LatAm hospitals]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[javier-contreras-cevallos-executive-president-grupo-conclina]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have you positioned your hospital group within the healthcare landscape in the country?</h4><p>We are one of the largest hospitals in the private sector in Ecuador. At the time of our establishment, there were mostly smaller clinics in the country. When we opened, we attracted many healthcare professional who studied abroad and wanted to utilize their experience in a large-scale hospital. This led to a scaling up of other healthcare facilities as well, so in that sense we were pioneers in improving the standards. As the first and only hospital in Ecuador, we have JCI accreditation, while we rank within the 25 best hospitals in Latin America, by America Economia. Still, we keep working on improving our standards: being the best in Ecuador is not enough for us. To be able to provide people with the best level of care, we invested in a medical prepaid company called Humana, which functions like an insurance company and gives wider access to healthcare. Still the healthcare environment in Ecuador is not that patient-friendly yet, with confusion over the role of the private sector and the public sector, in terms of financing this access. Our constitution states that the country—the government—will guarantee access to everybody, but sometimes the authorities, then, state that part of this responsibility comes to the private sector. Through the social security institutions, people make their obligatory payments to be eligible to healthcare. The rest of population has access provided by the Ministry of Health. The private sector does not get funding from that and self finance our operations is a must.</p><h4>How should the synergies between the public and private sector be enhanced?</h4><p>Three years ago, therefore, we had to close down our transplant facilities—the only such facilities in the country—because due to the system in place, our bills could not be paid. As a private institution, we should be able to invest in our healthcare, and provide it in return for sufficient financing. Shutting down our transplant unit was not good for the country — public and private healthcare should complement each other. Currently, the way the public and private sector interact put financial pressure on the private healthcare providers, which has even led to bankruptcy of some. Fortunately, in 2012, we managed to open up our agreements with the social security institute to put a limitation on our exposure under that payment structure. There is a new law under review, the “Código Orgánico de la Salud", and although people need the best possible care, but proper financing is just as important for sustainability of the sector. In the private healthcare sector, there will always be a corporate view so you can sustain your operations. That does mean, you cannot accept all patients for free, obviously. That said, we have a strong CSR program in place, and we do receive around 9,000 patients almost for free for medical consultations, in addition to 650 complex surgeries for those who cannot afford it. It is our vision to be conscious, to provide affordable care, while maintaining operations as an enterprise. The Ministry of Health should take care of the rest, one way or another. Currently, there is a great opportunity to improve healthcare, and we are happy to collaborate with the ministry and the other healthcare facilities to make this happen and to complement one another.</p><h4>What are the ambitions for the coming year?</h4><p>We would like to further advance in tertiary and specialize care, as we have the expertise in-house. In the short and mid-term, the road ahead is quite challenging but I do believe that in the long term, we can achieve our goals for Grupo Conclina, while also moving towards a better healthcare environment in general. The public sector is focusing on preventive healthcare, as they should be, but they are diverting some of their responsibilities to us. As a listed company with 2,000 shareholders, we have to maintain an enterprising perspective and be rational. The general occupation in the private sector is 65%, so there is unused capacity that should be allocated for the greater good.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are Venit's strategies for expanding in Querétaro and other cities of similar size?</h4><p>Querétaro has been taking up a great deal of our time, and it is growing steadil, in fact, faster than most of the country. We have been developing projects in the city faster than we thought. We started four projects in 2017 just in Querétaro alone, so there is still a great deal of room here, and it will not slow down for at least the next five to 10 years. The service, technology, automobile, and aerospace industries are experiencing strong growth in Mexico and Querétaro. Querétaro will be one of our main places to develop for the mid-term. However, we are not abandoning the other cities; we did start several small projects in a few cities, and Monterrey is coming back to us with some exciting opportunities, along with exciting projects in León, Zacatecas, and Mérida.</p><h4>What trends do you notice in the local housing sector?</h4><p>As the population that wants to rent increases and becomes more mainstream, the rental business will be more institutionalized. Currently, there are mostly 'mom-and-pop' type rental businesses. The entire business of student housing was informal a few years ago. Now, there are projects being developed and tailor made just for that. A few years ago, we did one in Monterrey and are currently working on one in Querétaro. As more and more people move to cities, almost the entire spectrum of rental housing will grow. This is an interesting trend that is just starting, though I do not see it booming in the next year or so.</p><h4>How have you seen the office segment increase in sophistication?</h4><p>Office space is still exciting. In terms of sophistication as a real estate market, more people want to have their offices in corporate buildings with security and amenities. Just as more people want better housing or better commercial space, more people seek better office spaces, which gives us great potential. Mexico City is seeking to pass a law to allow buildings to be built without any parking space. It seeks to encourage people not to use cars, which is a great thing; these changes will be interesting for the real estate sector in the coming years</p><h4>How would you assess the current investment climate in real estate?</h4><p>The investment climate has changed significantly. The Trump factor and the rising costs due to a stronger dollar caused many investors to wait. However, more people have faith in real estate as a long-term investment. There is a great deal of cash in the market, and not just in Mexico; real estate is an interesting place for investment. Fibras and the growing sophistication of the market are coming together to make the real estate market boom.</p><h4>What are your expectations and priorities for 2018?</h4><p>Apartments will make up a large portion of our market share and our business model, and we will develop many apartments for the next three years. In the coming year, we are starting between four and five projects that are solely focused on apartment buildings. We are also looking at more opportunities in office space. We have two business models in office for rental and sales. In Monterrey, many people do not want to rent and prefer to buy so we are looking into it and working out something truly great. Hopefully, we will start a couple of new projects around 1H2018, one in Monterrey and one in Querétaro in office space. Housing and offices will be our main focuses as they are not impacted as easily as retail; the growing business climate creates a need for office space and we are looking forward to fulfill that supply-demand gap.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does Mexico play in your regional expansion plans?</h4><p>Mexico represents a significant market for us. With its population of 123.5 million people and access to nearly 11.7 million patients for medical cannabis, we see an attractive opportunity to transfer the wealth of knowledge we have created into this new market. Mexico will play an important near-term role in helping us achieve our business objectives. Ultimately, it is our intent to be the leading medical cannabis brand across all of Latin America and a major global exporter of medical cannabis products.</p><h4>How does Mexico's regulatory environment compare to other Latin American markets in which you are also interested?</h4><p>Although slightly more limiting—for example, Mexico currently only permits the import of medical cannabis products that contain less than 1% tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)—the regulatory structure for medical cannabis in Mexico is similar to that of Colombia, in that both countries have exclusively legalized cannabis extracts as a means to generate a market for legitimate medical products of the highest quality and consistency. While excluding recreational cannabis and the inherent societal challenges that go along with it, the medical cannabis regulations create an opportunity for innovative companies to develop master preparations, phytotherapeutic products, and ethical drugs that can be distributed to patients through well-regulated channels.</p><h4>How would you assess the level of support for medical cannabis in the country, both from the general public and the government?</h4><p>The Mexican government is taking a cautious and well-calculated approach to the legalization of medical cannabis in the country, as it clearly wants to avoid any missteps that could potentially exacerbate, rather than reduce, the well-known troubles Mexico has had with criminal organizations involved in the illegal drug trade. The Mexican government's efforts in this area are being driven by a deep and genuine belief that the potential social, health, and economic benefits of legalized medical cannabis could have a major positive impact for the whole country. The Mexican people predominantly hold conservative social views that could conceivably impede the government's efforts to legalize cannabis. However, despite the fact that the vast majority of Mexicans are opposed to the legalization of cannabis for recreational purposes, surveys show that more than 75% support the legalization of medical cannabis. We fully expect support to grow even stronger as more patients are successfully treated for a range of health problems and the body of evidence builds that medical cannabis is a safe, effective, and affordable option for many ailments.</p><h4>What role do you see for a robust medical cannabis industry in Mexico?</h4><p>Khiron is the first medical cannabis company in Latin America to implement US DEA standard pharmaceutical compliance protocols for security and safety. We have a scalable and comprehensive security plan that identifies and mitigates risks relating to Khiron's assets and covers the entire production, distribution, logistics, and operations chain. We are setting a standard that the entire medical cannabis industry can emulate. The long-term viability of the industry and all the social, health, and economic benefits it can bring to the nation—including reducing drug addiction and related crimes—are well worth the effort. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Five years after education reform in Mexico, how would you evaluate the results obtained so far and what do you consider the main achievement and what is the biggest drawback of this implementation phase?</h4><p>The reform was essential; Mexico invests around 7% of GDP in education, more than the average of countries belonging to the OECD and above countries such as Germany and Poland. Despite that, Mexico faces significant challenges regarding coverage, quality, and equity. The rethinking of the curricula worked extremely well because it adapted to the requirements of the 21st century by taking into account skills such as critical thinking, the ability to learn, English language, and technology. On the other hand, aspects such as professional teaching service, evaluation schemes, and incentives were outlined. Today, almost half of the states of the Republic improved in the assessments in the areas of language and mathematics. We reached 25,000 full-time schools toward the end of this six-year term. In 2000, there were only 6,000 schools with this model, which has proven to be successful regarding the abilities of the students. Despite the reform's successes, we must recognize its failures. For example, the lack of clarity in the mechanism to follow up on the selection of teachers. Likewise, there are significant challenges in the training of teaching staff for the new curricula on issues of equity and upper secondary education coverage; the reform did not cover higher education. As a reference of how the quality of our system is seen at an international level, Universitas 21 ranks Mexico's university system at 46 out of 50 systems around the world, while QS World University Rankings puts us at 33 out of 50.</p><h4>Regarding the link with the labor market, how does Tec strive to align its offer to the current needs of the labor market in the context of the Fourth Industrial Revolution?</h4><p>In Tec de Monterrey, we do not just point to the current needs—we try to predict future trends. After analyzing, we concluded that the Mexican education system employs 20th century teachers and educational models for 21st-century students. Today, the world is changing faster than ever before and all graduates must have specific competencies to face future challenges such as the Fourth Industrial Revolution. We are convinced that many of the jobs that currently exist will be transformed. Therefore, innovation, creativity, and reinvention of work is needed because the use of machines and artificial intelligence is a reality. Our approach toward a transformation of the educational model can support the development of multidisciplinary competencies.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the collaboration between academia and private companies in Mexico to carry out joint projects in applied research?</h4><p>It is incipient. Today, Mexico allocates about 0.5% of GDP to R&amp;D. From the perspective of public and private investment in the sector, Japan has around 78% of private investment; South Korea has 75%, Chile has 35%, and Mexico has around 20%, posing a great challenge. Tec de Monterrey is a private non-profit institution that has to find the majority of its resources in the public sector whose funds are sought by all universities.</p><h4>How will the China-Mexico Innovation Center promote entrepreneurship at Tec de Monterrey, and what has been the strategy of the institution to diversify and deepen international alliances?</h4><p>We believe that we must follow the investigation model to move towards entrepreneurship that can come to support the economic and social development. Over time, we have created entrepreneurship ecosystems with accelerators, technology parks, and other different schemes to promote entrepreneurship and knowledge economy. We have looked for international alliances that can help us in technology transfer, access to resources, and exchange leading practices. With the Mexico-China Innovation Center, located in Zhejiang, we expect to have an acceleration of companies in that region, which is experiencing innovation on a massive level. In fact, that area is defined as the "city of artificial intelligence." The Ali Baba Company is also located there, which is close to the government entity and the entity with which we will be collaborating. The region was interested in the profile of Tecnológico de Monterrey because it is a way to access entrepreneurial talent in Mexico. In addition, we were interested in the availability of resources and the link we can have with the entrepreneurship ecosystem of China. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the biggest challenges and achievements in implementing the education reform?</h4><p>The education reform, which affects one of the world's biggest education systems—some 25 million students and 1.2 million teachers—was undertaken from our need to go from a system whose main achievement during the 20th century was universal educational education coverage to one that meets the qualitative needs of the 21st. To do so, the constitutional reforms have set up a system to grade teachers' merits and tie this to their income, continuity, and eventual opportunities for promotion. By implementing fair and transparent assessment processes, these teacher evaluations have given us a more qualified recruitment process and merit-based promotion. They also allow the education system to improve by identifying those teachers most in need of training. So far, more than 1,242,000 teacher evaluations have been made, of which 919,288 have been enrolled in periodic training courses and more than 820,000 have received training for carrying out the new study program. What is more, 90,738 teachers have received a 35% salary increase, which over their careers can go as high as 271% throughout their careers. Apart from that, we now have accurate information about schools' deficiencies and teaching resources, thanks to the Census of Schools, Teachers, and Elementary School Students.</p><h4>How are you cooperating with the private sector to promote dual education within the context of the fourth industrial revolution (I4.0)?</h4><p>Technology and knowledge transfers represent a virtuous cycle in the educational and productive sectors, whose defining criteria are possible thanks to strategic alliances made with the productive sector. One of the alliances we made was a dual education cooperation between sectors through consensus and interaction with decisive stakeholders such as the Chamber of Commerce, which represents strategic productive sectors such as manufacturing, services, agricultural, and processing industries. Under this alliance, we perform foresight exercises to know where the labor market is moving and adjust the provision of education accordingly to higher demands. In the long run, this will provide more competitive salaries, increase formal employment, and improve overall employment</p><h4>What is your strategy for raising Mexico's results in the PISA test, and what are the country's goals concerning this examination for the next five years?</h4><p>In coordination with state governments, the Secretary of Public Education has a strategy for strengthening the skills and learning of students between 15 and 16 years of age. The results from 2015 put the country at minimum proficiency levels. For this reason, the strategy aims to enhance skills in three areas of the test and to make students and teachers more comfortable with the type of assessment tools used by PISA. Among the actions taken is the “Getting to know PISA" course done with the support of the Carlos Slim foundation through the PruébaT platform, which offers students and teachers digital tools similar to PISA exercises. </p><h4>Recently, a sixth round of National Education Infrastructure Certificates (CIEN) was issued in the Mexican Stock Market (BMV). How have investors received this financial vehicle and what are the current needs of public schools in terms of infrastructure?</h4><p>In May 2018, the sixth round of CIEN was issued at MXN900 million on the Mexican Stock Exchange, which means an investment of MXN40 billion for the program. The source of these infrastructure certificates is the States Contributions Fund, which represents less than 1% of the federal tax collection, making it a stable and viable resource. This is not about taking loans in order to invest but using an asset that the states already have. As part of the education reform, we carried out a census on the conditions of educational infrastructure around the country. By doing so, we chose the school buildings with the greatest need in every state. This program is expected to benefit 6 million students through investments in 33,000 schools. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role can medical devices play as a driver for the Mexican economy?</h4><p>The role of medical devices is an important one not only in the treatment of patients, but also in production and exportation. They represent a technological transformation in healthcare. Mexico is the largest exporter of medical devices in Latin America and the ninth-largest in the world, larger than Germany and Italy. We still have potential to become number two or number three. The capabilities we have built as a country in terms of manufacturing in the past few years in the automotive and the aerospace industries are now spilling over into the medical device industry</p><h4>How can inefficiencies in the healthcare system be mitigated by medical device innovations? </h4><p>Our focus is on turning technological improvements into something that makes sense for the patient as well as for the healthcare system as a whole. As an example, now we have a way to monitor patients with pacemakers without having the patient come into the clinic. Many who have a pacemaker will still need to go to a specialized hospital that can only be found in major cities in Mexico. Having this service provided remotely will have a huge impact on the economy and the people affected by these ailments. We have a device that can monitor patients in their houses, and you can tell which patients are the ones that truly need to visit the hospital. We want to look at the total cost of intervention healthcare and work together to streamline that to make sure you will be able to service more patients with the best help</p><h4>What are the biggest challenges you are facing in terms of adding value to and expanding manufacturing of medical devices in Mexico?</h4><p>Number one is awareness. In Mexico, people only think of pharmaceuticals when referring to the healthcare industry, but the level of complexity and development is totally different. Developing a molecule is tough, but once you have the molecule developed it is just about commercializing the product. This is not the same as medical devices, where you develop the device and then need to train the physicians and nurses to use it. You even need to train the patient for the follow-up after surgery. Developing the purchasing, regulatory, and quality processes for medical devices is different, and that is where we are struggling. We need to ensure the regulatory agencies understand this and demonstrate that using medical devices can help optimize therapies. The entire healthcare chain improves with the correct introduction of medical devices.</p><h4>What is the Mexican market's role in Medtronic's growth in Latin America?</h4><p>We have been growing by double digits in Mexico for the last two years, and our potential is even higher. We need to invest to further develop the market, as we feel we have not really scratched the surface yet; we need to grow faster than Latin America in the next three-five years. We also need to build and invest in the country and create conditions that ensure that growth is not only maintained but accelerated. Mexico has not been among the top recipients of pharmaceutical and medical device investment in the last 10 years, which has gone to Brazil, Costa Rica, Panama, or Colombia instead because we have not really positioned Mexico as the strategic market that it should be.</p><h4>What is needed to increase its investment attractiveness?</h4><p>The first is education—innovative ways of treating medicine are not taught in Mexican universities. One way to solve that is to design an education curriculum that allows physicians to be exposed to technology at the resident stage. The second one is infrastructure. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize Mexico's strengths and weaknesses as a health tourism destination? </h4><p>Mexico has great potential as far as medical tourism is concerned for various reasons. First, we have access to the best diagnostic and surgical medical equipment infrastructure due to our multilateral trade agreements. Our hospitals are equipped to the same standards as the best US, Canadian, or European ones. Second, we have highly qualified medical personnel. For many years, Mexican public universities have had great medical, chemistry, and nursing faculties whose graduates are capable of providing high-quality medical services. Mexico exports a great deal of talent to other countries, and our challenge is to keep these professionals in Mexico. The third reason is our incomparable geographical location, neighboring the largest markets for medical tourism, the US and Canada. Although NAFTA is currently under review, it has substantially increased the exchange of goods and services between these markets and Mexico. We welcome medical tourists seeking cheaper and high quality medical services in both our public and private sectors certified by the Mexican Health Council and international entities such as the Joint Commission and the Canadian Accreditation Council, which keeps the highest standards of care.</p><h4>Private and public players are both promoting Mexico as a destination for medical tourism. Which is taking the lead? </h4><p>We need coordination and a greater effort from our government to help connect relevant players in the medical tourism industry. The federal government is the only one capable of structuring the basis for growth in the industry, and it has fallen short in this important task. Many of the officers in charge of preparing public policies are not following the right path, for they have no experience nor show any interest in the industry. They unfortunately reach those positions for political reasons rather than genuinely pursuing benefits for the industry. The government should coordinate the different branches and implement a coherent policy for widely promoting medical tourism in both sectors. </p><h4>What is Amerimed's strategy to attract foreign patients?</h4><p>We began as a company that provided high-quality medical services for tourists who visited Mexico via cruise ships for many years; Carnival, Royal Caribbean, Norwegian, Princess and Holland America were among our customers. We have grown over the past decade by establishing our high-end boutique hospitals in the main touristic destinations: Los Cabos, Puerto Vallarta, Cozumel, and Cancún. Now we are building a brand new hospital in Playa del Carmen. In November 2014, we sold our facilities on the Pacific Coast to a Spanish hospital chain and kept the ones in the Riviera Maya. About 35% of our patients are foreigners and represent more than half of our total revenue. We have an excellent relationship with most of the international insurers. We specialize in intensive care but feature mostly all medical specialties, ranging from emergencies to kidney transplants. All of our hospitals are well equipped with MRIs, CT X-ray scanners, cathlabs, laboratories, and pharmacies. Our staff is bilingual and takes pride in keeping the highest standards in providing medical services, and we aim to have a hospital in each of the biggest touristic destinations. </p><h4>How do you differentiate your health offerings from other players in the tourism industry?</h4><p>We enter into agreements with most of the hotel chains and international cruise lines under a strictly commercial relationship. We also welcome foreign investment in our business. This does not mean that we are exclusively focused on foreign patients, but that we would like to cater more to the foreign market. We need to be present in the most frequently visited touristic destinations in Mexico. We are committed to providing high-quality medical services, hiring the best doctors, and having the best-equipped facilities in Mexico, even though we have small hospitals with less than 40 beds each. We have ambitious growth plans for the next five years and will soon be entering a joint venture with a private equity fund to gear up for the world medical touristic market. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the relative importance of the domestic Mexican market for Pfizer's global sales portfolio?</h4><p>For Pfizer, Mexico is one of its most important markets and is a top 15 affiliate worldwide. It is a key player in the emerging market space, and the company sees much more growth potential in years to come here.</p><h4>What are the drivers behind Pfizer's above-average 9% growth in Mexico in 2017?</h4><p>The major driver is our participation in the segments with the most growth in the local pharmaceutical market. We have the most diversified portfolio; we have been innovating and producing new products for over 100 years in many different medical fields. We also participate in growing segments such as branded generics and biosimilars. The combination of all these new product launches helped us grow at almost double the rate of the broader market. Our diverse portfolio and ability to launch new products every other year have allowed us to remain an industry leader.</p><h4>What is your strategy to gain market share in the biosimilar segment?</h4><p>We have introduced one biosimilar that targets inflammation. Through this introduction, we have been able to win the consolidated tender in Mexico. Our product is being used in the main social security institutes, among many others. Pfizer is investing more than USD1 billion in developing biosimilars. We are developing the five most-used biologics worldwide, targeting both inflammation and oncology. We are developing biosimilars for each of the top-five biologics and expect to launch these between 2019 and 2022.</p><h4>What is your innovation strategy, and how does this innovation help tackle Mexico's main public health challenges?</h4><p>Today, non-communicable diseases are more impactful. In this regard, our R&amp;D is perfectly aligned to meet this challenge. We are investigating in many different areas, from cardiovascular to oncology. We are also investigating rare diseases. Antibiotics are particularly important. An issue that will become increasingly important is antimicrobial resistance. Currently, antibiotics do not cover the resistances they need; there has been a global commitment from the pharmaceutical industry to work toward new antibiotics. Pfizer has taken the lead in this subject, and we are currently investigating the development of many new antibiotics. We launched a new one in 2017 and another in 2018. We have three more in the R&amp;D process. This is an important area of focus for Pfizer.</p><h4>How would you assess cooperation between the public and the private sectors in terms of improving health access to lower-income populations?</h4><p>Mexico is not investing enough in health. Health needs to be a priority for the next government. Additionally, it is an intelligent investment. We have been working to underline the link between investing in healthcare and productivity in the country. This is extremely important in Mexico, because our demographic bonus will not last forever. We have perhaps 15 more years of having a greater percentage of the population working than not working. This is when Mexico needs to invest, and this will boost the economic growth of the entire country. However, in order to do so, we need more public and private investment and cooperation.</p><h4>Can you give us an overview of Pfizer Pro and how physicians have taken to it?</h4><p>Pfizer Pro is our main digital platform, where every healthcare professional can access the most up-to-date medical information. We started developing this several years ago as a new way to interact with our healthcare professionals. We always say our biggest competitor is a lack of knowledge, which is why our main investment is on medical education. In 2017 we improved our platform, and professionals can interact with our information through some of the most-used media and social networking platforms. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[attuned-to-popular-demand]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>PINSA has invested in new plants and developments over the past few years. How would you rate the return on these investments?</h4><p>Our frozen products plant, which opened in 2015, started with a few stumbles because it was a new process, but is now working at full capacity. We produce both for national consumption and exports, and in the national market, our products have been received extremely well. In fact, we had to limit our distribution because demand is higher than capacity. We are also evaluating an increase in production and capacity. It will be multimillion-dollar investment, and increasing its capacity two years later is a decision that must be analyzed carefully. The sardine plant was opened in 2016, consolidated in 2017, and is now operating at around 80-90% capacity. The Dolores and Portola brands have been well received in both forms: the traditional-sized sardine can and the Dolores select snack-sized presentation</p><h4>What are your investment priorities for the future?</h4><p>Our core business is canned tuna. We have grown in volume and market share over the last few years and produce over two million cans per day. Our capacity is slightly higher than that number, though the plant is performing well. We are working on improving processes; the group believes in Mexico and is investing heavily here. It has invested over USD300 million over the past three years on new plants, increasing the number of ships, improving the canning plant, and more. The group has seen substantial returns in those investments.</p><h4>How do you evaluate the evolution of tuna and sea product consumption in Mexico?</h4><p>Today, everyone is more conscious about nutrition. Tuna does not have many negative aspects in terms of health hazards, and has a great cost-benefit ratio. Today one can find tuna options in any meat restaurant. It has Omega 3, iron, and vitamins. All these factors have truly boosted demand. The canned tuna category represents 5% of the total of processed foods in Mexico, which is huge. As a company, we have grown to represent more than 50% of the market, due to the investment in marketing, distribution, and improving processes. In terms of frozen products, it is still a small market, but has great potential.</p><h4>What are PINSA's sustainability standards? </h4><p>We meet every requirement, and there is a global association called the Marine Stewardship Council that certifies fishing processes. Ours are sustainable, and all our ships have an observer from an independent environmental body that ensures we do not affect any other species. Due to the tuna embargo, we are not allowed to sell Mexican tuna in the US. However, we are currently more focused on the Mexican market. We want to increase per capita consumption in Mexico, which is currently eight cans of tuna per year.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Mexico becoming an exporter of tuna?</h4><p>In terms of tuna, we process 70-80% of what we fish, which is high. We do buy some because demand has surpassed our fishing capacities, despite the fact that we operate half the fishing boats in Mexico. For tuna, local producers are not concerned about exporting at the moment because the local market is so vibrant. At the same time, the costs of fishing and subsequent processes and transportation costs to other markets might complicate entering other distant markets at competitive prices.</p><h4>What is your strategy for having a presence in each segment of the market?</h4><p>In tuna, we have three brands: Dolores, Mazatún, and El Dorado. Dolores is the leading brand in the country and has a national presence, the best quality in the market, and consumer recognition. The Mazatún brand is strong in states where we have a presence, such as Sonora, Sinaloa, Durango, and Chihuahua, though it does not have national coverage. The El Dorado brand is focused primarily on the mid-range market segment, with excellent quality at a more accessible price. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[better-spirits-on-the-rise]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you see the consumption of spirits and alcohol evolving in Mexico?</h4><p>The spirits industry in Mexico is healthy. It has been a slightly challenging year after the earthquake and the economic deceleration. The industry is turning toward more premium brands—as a trend, we find people looking for quality and reaching out to better spirits. We are doing well; Diageo's growth is higher than the entire industry, which sees almost double-digit growth. There is a healthy trend toward premium brands that are both local and international. Spirits are becoming more dynamic, and there is more innovation. Spirits, such as gin and mezcal, and cocktails are becoming more popular. The industry is evolving along similar patterns to those we see internationally.</p><h4>What was the rationale behind your recent acquisition of Pierde Almas?</h4><p>When we started looking at mezcal, we were thinking of bolt-on acquisitions or associations. We invested in associations with other mezcal producers, though we decided to acquire Pierde Almas. We want to have a portfolio of options to present to consumers, and Pierde Almas is in the ultra-luxury segment. We will focus on exporting to the US and making sure the top segments at home and abroad become familiar with this excellent liquid. We are extremely proud of this acquisition and will continue working hard to expand our presence in the Mexican spirits market. It is one step toward our ambition of having a truly great portfolio to maximize consumer choice. As a luxury brand, Pierde Almas will be produced in small batches of superior quality. We love the history of the brand, and the taste is unmatched. The idea is to maximize the value of this family-developed brand. We want to keep the owner close to us because he is the master mezcalier and brand ambassador.</p><h4>What is behind the global boom in mezcal?</h4><p>People want craft, expertise, and a link to tradition and history. This is also a community-driven spirit, and people really love that. The boom started in the US, where consumers love to link their products to tradition, history, and community support. This was the major driver of international growth. Mezcal is Mexican; it is a small but important category in the Mexican market. The global sales for artisanal mezcal are still only 300,000 cases, though there is the potential to grow this to 2 million. This is what we want to support in order to keep communities together and traditions alive. We see this same growth trend for every craft spirit. People want to get close to craft and authentic stories.</p><h4>Do you plan to focus more on craft distilleries in the future?</h4><p>Mezcal is a 10-year vision. We truly want to make sure we are well positioned to capture the spirits growth if and when it truly takes off. We have done the same thing with tequila by investing in Casamigos. This company has a craft-oriented focus and is made in small batches by three friends. The craft trend is happening in every category, and we want to be ahead of the trend and ahead of the curve for mezcal.</p><h4>Are your distribution channels changing with technology?</h4><p>Spirits have not seen a huge technological disruption yet. However, we are starting to partner with different technology players to make sure that when the disruption happens, we are positioned to take advantage of it and satisfy consumer needs. There is some interesting growth in e-commerce type activity already taking place, though it is still tiny. It does not account for even 1% of total sales. This is because it is expensive and subject to many regulations. In distribution, one has to be careful because there are many requirements, and we want to make sure we take the correct steps. Trends are developing, though they are still in the initial stages. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[much-more-to-give]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance of the Mexican domestic market for your global production and sales strategy?</h4><p>Yara Mexico belongs to one of the company's several business units, which is Latin America, and Mexico represents 30% of the region. Our local target for 2018 is to sell 700,000 tons. We have been in Mexico for 15 years and a target of 700,000 tons shows that the market truly appreciates the solutions we sell. We had an excellent 2017, and thus far 2018 has been doing just as well. Customers want more solutions from Yara, and we are constantly growing. In order to grow, we have several strategies, all of which go back to the core of our focus, which is always the end user or the farmer. What we deliver will be measured. If we perform better than the competition, customers will be loyal and will tell their friends and family about our solutions. This is why we are literally growing by the day.</p><h4>What are your priorities in terms of R&amp;D and your strategy to transfer your innovations to farmers?</h4><p>All our R&amp;D is aimed at helping our customers and agriculture by boosting productivity. We have a great global presence and are in many different crops, climates, and geographies around the world. Our R&amp;D department is a reflection of this and uses a variety of techniques. In the end, there is always an alternative to our product: we have competition left and right. The alternative is to test something else, though our customers have always been loyal. In terms of our transfer strategy, we conduct many trials and compare the solutions we provide and the fertilizer being used by farmers in the villages. We test both fertilizers and after six weeks judge the difference between the crops. That is how we create tangible evidence for our customers</p><h4>What are the main challenges faced by Mexican farmers?</h4><p>This is a huge country with total arable land of 21 million ha. Of the 15 million that are fertilized, only 10 million ha are done correctly. The remaining 5 million ha are a business opportunity. There are 5 million farmers in the country, and the majority of them inherited their land and their way of cultivating and managing the field. When we come and present a solution as opposed to a product is when we make a difference, because our solution can increase yields by 20%. We engage with our customers and they come back and thank us. This goes beyond profits; we are making a difference in the country and are more environmentally friendly. With a Yara solution, nitrogen losses are extremely small</p><h4>How are you contributing to raising productivity and improving food security in the country, especially in the case of corn?</h4><p>We have touched the subject in many different ways. When we analyzed the statistics, we realized Mexico is completely dependent on the US for corn. Mexico could be self-sufficient if it had the productivity. That is where Yara comes in with a solution that goes beyond a product specification. It is not just about nutrients but how one works in the field. We are working to increase productivity and are making an impact on the environment</p><h4>How would you assess the overall competitiveness of Mexican farmers?</h4><p>This region is huge and certain countries are more developed in terms of management in the field. As there are so many different climate zones, we can grow crops from all over the world here, but El Niño and other weather conditions must be taken into account. Mexico has much more to give, especially in terms of productivity.</p><h4>Which products have the biggest potential for growth?</h4><p>Maize still has the biggest potential. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[An Intangible Heritage]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[an-intangible-heritage]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Under which financial and administrative arrangement do you operate?</h4><p>We operate through a private trust built on municipal land in which tenants have either a definitive transfer lasting 99 years or a temporary one. The trust has just turned 35, meaning in 64 years when it is over, everything returns to the property of the government of Mexico City, though this will likely be adjusted when the time comes. It works through fees charged to participants, the entrance and parking toll, and the monthly rent from public toilets. We do not have public resources, but have two structures, a government one to cover the salaries of those who work here, and a private structure where everything that is collected is distributed and reinvested. </p><h4>How do you measure the economic spillover that the Central de Abasto generates in the city and wider metropolitan area?</h4><p>It generates an impact at the national level because it supplies 80% of what is consumed in the Mexico City metropolitan area and 35% nationally. This country has a large territory with different climates, so the products are not from a single region. The Central de Abasto is the second most-important economic unit in the country and generates USD9 billion, as well as 90,000 direct and 500,000 indirect jobs. Another important fact is that we have the highest concentration of SMEs nationwide, some 6,000; it is a cluster of entrepreneurship and an important logistics center. It is also important to highlight that in 35 years it has not closed its doors even once—not even during in the earthquakes of 1985 and 2017—which has been hugely important to protecting the nation's food supply. </p><h4>What infrastructure challenges do you face on a day-to-day basis?</h4><p>There has been no need for a major structural modification; the plant essentially remains the same with the flower and vegetables market and commercial plaza, while the supply, reception, and distribution of food has maintained its structure. This plant is the only one in the world that works 24/7, 365 days a year; thus, our capacity to do maintenance work—due to this and our budget—is limited. The biggest problem we have is in the paving of the maneuver yard where the trailers arrive, which requires a USD23-million investment, not to mention all the time and logistics it would take to not stop the power station. This is why we have urged the federal government to take the issue much more seriously. </p><h4>What strategy do you have to cushion the urban impact of the Central and make its logistics as fluid as possible?<br></h4><p>Generally, the issue of traffic is complicated because 60,000 vehicles enter daily. To cushion this impact, we have an internal transportation system called Cedabús. Concerning logistics, e-commerce is something that will gradually grow and start replacing much of the wholesale visits to Central, which will have a positive impact on pollution and mobility. We have also developed sustainability strategies that are underway, such as the installation of solar panels on the roofs of warehouses. If panels for all the ceilings were developed, we would have the largest solar farm in Latin America. We also have natural gas projects, which account for almost 100% of our supply. </p><h4>What has been your strategy to put the Central on the tourist map?</h4><p>As the biggest wholesale market in the world, we ought to be a tourist destination. Not to mention the cultural aspect we bring through our art and murals. We also participate in various world gastronomy forums, since Mexican food is an intangible heritage of all humanity, and are closing a deal to have a tourist bus company include the Central in its tour. In 2017, we made a documentary about the Central and its murals, presented a book, and launched a new logo. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-first-for-everything]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the strategic importance of Mexico for Ferrero's regional plans?</h4><p>The plant we established in 2013 has four lines: Kinder Sorpresa, Kinder Chocolate, Kinder Delice, and Nutella. It also contains the first research laboratory on the American continent and outside of Europe, which demonstrates how vital Mexico is. The new facility cost USD200 million and serves the Mexican market, though it also has a strategic position for Latin and North America. We also want to explore certain new Mexican raw materials and use them to improve existing ones. Mexico is top 10 in the field of invoicing within the company. Furthermore, its culture straddles North and South America and therefore has aspects of both markets. What works here could also work in other countries.</p><h4>Ferrero is committed to using 100% sustainably sourced cocoa by 2020. What challenges are you facing to reach your target?</h4><p>We already have 100% sustainable palm oil production and 60-70% for cocoa production. We want to boost the latter figure to 100% by 2020. To do so, we want to find suppliers with strict quality and work standards because we seek to integrate environmental protection with decent work without human exploitation. We want to send our experts periodically to audit suppliers and help them meet these social and production standards.</p><h4>Ferrero Mexico expects double-digit sales growth for 2018, an ongoing trend for the last several years. What factors are behind this?</h4><p>Ferrero has excellent products and competent personnel in terms of professional training and ability to work with others. We want to create a company where knowledge, accountability, and empowerment form the basis and only increase with time. On the other hand, we have a product that sees great demand. Behind our desired products, there is a research effort to understand the needs of the consumer. This manifests the respect we have for consumers' preferences.</p><h4>What future investments do you have in the pipeline for the country?</h4><p>The projects are confidential, though we are exploring the possibility of extending our local production capacity. We are analyzing whether it is appropriate to do it now or wait a few months. We also have a development plan for the business in Mexico, and our existing plant may grow in production in the coming years</p><h4>Nearly half of your local production is exported to the US and Canada. How might NAFTA renegotiations impact your export strategy?</h4><p>We must comply with government decisions. We are definitely in favor of NAFTA and would be pleased if a favorable negotiation is achieved. Otherwise, we have our Plan B—one must always be prepared. As a resilient company, Ferrero has to be ready to face crises, as it has done in other markets in the past.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2018?</h4><p>We want to stabilize the launch of Kinder Delice Strawberry, which got off the ground in September 2017. The first months are chaotic because it entails execution, consumer perceptions, and other variables that complicate the process. The first months after the stabilization period help us understand the potential of the project and what does and does not work. We want to continue to grow as a product, conducting tests on possible future releases for the coming years. After the earthquake, we were worried about our Mexican people and what we could do to help them. We are in the third phase of a project to bring hope to our Mexican brothers. With the money collected during our Christmas concert, in addition to an amount the company will donate, we will support a reconstruction project. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[creating-unique-spaces]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What type of companies do you target?</h4><p>We have two main lines of business: offices and retail spaces. Our clients are large multinational companies. As for national companies, we only have large clients, such as Alsea, Grupo Nacional Provincial (GNP), as well as several banks. We do not have medium or small clients because we offer integral services. Multinationals typically are not sure how to organize their facilities to launch operations in Mexico; hence, we support them throughout the process. Mexico is a great country to do business. It offers the opportunity to generate large revenues, but companies have to surround themselves with the right people to achieve it.</p><h4>How widely used is the 360 degrees project model in Mexico, and why do you prefer it over the design-build model?</h4><p>There are several differences between design-build and a 360-degrees project. A design-build includes design and construction; however, a 360-degrees project has many additional elements such as real estate, which means finding the most appropriate location for the business. You also receive a customized business model, including office furniture, which sometimes causes budgets to exceed. In addition, we also determine how the operation is going to be carried out, for example, whether companies will operate through a third party or whether they have all the equipment to carry it out themselves. We want the client to have a general view of the problem, because the easiest part of the project is to build. Doing that comprehensive analysis and offering a 360-degrees project is our differentiating factor. We are the only ones providing this model for offices and retail businesses.</p><h4>How are new trends in management reflecting on the design of the offices, changing your clients' needs and preferences? </h4><p>Overall, we try to be cutting edge and push the clients to new schemes. An important aspect of working in different modalities is that we must have a space designed for that form of working. We design spaces that foster collaboration and effective work.</p><h4>How do your designs contribute to staff satisfaction, productivity, and talent retention?</h4><p>We must have open spaces, and different spaces for collaboration. Nowadays, objectives and projects are assigned to teams, not to individuals. Having an adequate space for those teams to meet allows us to develop and boost collaboration and creativity. We can have many different sizes of meetings rooms, varied furniture, screens, and boards. They can be outside, inside, or mixed spaces, which is amazing for companies.</p><h4>What are your goals for 2018 and the strategies to achieve them?</h4><p>We have been working for years to transform from a family company to an institutional company. In that process, we have been adding experienced staff to the company. We are filling out our areas of expertise to grow exponentially, which we have had for a long time. We want to double our growth this year, compared to the previous year. Over the next three to four years, we will focus on becoming one of the most important companies in our sector in Mexico.</p><h4>Are you looking for alternate sources of financing, either from investors or the stock exchange market?</h4><p>We are doing both. We acquire financing through the banks, which view us favorably. Banks are more concerned with housing building companies, but our clients are large and robust companies. In terms of the stock exchange, we are working on a project to achieve that. We already have a corporate governance program, and we have reached the revenue to be public. We will enter the third-party audit program soon. It is a plan for the next few years. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Which segment of the market will you prioritize in the years to come?</h4><p>We are still considering diversifying, but we will focus on residential vertical urban developments, hotels, and commercial projects, namely retail spaces, offices, and mixed-use projects. We do not plan to be involved in industrial projects in the short or medium term.</p><h4>What is different about the way Grupo Frel is developing malls today compared to how they were built 20 years ago?</h4><p>Most of the projects that we have in the pipeline are office, residential, and mixed-use and not just malls. There has been a change in the way we design malls and customers seek other experiences and new things to do in a mall other than going there to buy something. Related to that, the design is changing to generate different experiences and new things for customers. For instance, in two of our malls in the Fibra, we created what we call Espacio Latino, a concept where we have a mix of different Latin American stores with artists, designers, and producers showing their different offerings including art, clothing, or fashion, all related to Latin American experiences. This will be combined with culinary experiences in a food hall featuring the different Latin American offerings. This will also be combined with different experiences such as tequila and mezcal tasting, mariachi music, or tango from Argentina. It will be a great offering and experience not only for foreigners visiting Mexican cities but also for locals. We want to launch the concept strongly and then replicate in other parts of the country to contribute to Mexico's world-class tourist attractions.</p><h4>Is there a growing appetite in Mexico for mixed-use developments?</h4><p>Mixed-use projects, especially in urban areas, are appealing for people because it is convenient to have different offerings close to their homes. In dense cities such as Mexico City, it is convenient for people to be able to walk to obtain the goods and services they need on a daily basis. Grupo Frel has three projects in the area known as Uptown Polanco, a nice district already being developed with residential apartments, offices, shopping malls, restaurants, theaters, and other cultural aspects. We will create something unique for the country: public areas on private property. We are creating, between the different projects, a 1km-long pedestrian pathway that will have retail spaces along the corridor and plazas for restaurants, cafes, and so on, making it a vibrant and dynamic area of the city.</p><h4>Will the earthquake affect the real estate market in Mexico?</h4><p>There are both positive and negative impacts. With some of these natural disasters, the economic outcome in the long term is positive because they incentivize investment and tend to make things move. Here in the city, some of the areas affected by the earthquake will suffer somewhat, though it will create opportunities in other areas that will spur residential and office construction.</p><h4>What do you expect in 2018?<br></h4><p>We are positive about the growth opportunities. The banks' indicators are a great predictor of the economy in general and bank results in Mexico are positive. They are growing heavily in terms of commercial loans for cars, personal loans, and mortgages. We are also positive because of the demographic bonus, which is a window of opportunity for every country at a certain stage and this is the case for Mexico, where the active economic population is larger than the non-economic population. We will have this situation at least until 2030. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the attractiveness of the Mexican real estate market for foreign investors at the moment?</h4><p>From a long-term perspective, Mexico is an attractive market given its young population, strong household formation, and increasing GDP per capita. In the coming years, there will be a strong demand for housing and continued growth in job generation which will result in greater demand for offices. If current consumption levels continue on an upward trend, we will also see more demand for retail. Industrial will also continue to grow as trade and FDI increase. However, there are certain challenges that we need to overcome. Market prices are overheated, and I expect to see an adjustment in prices sometime in the midterm. We have been in a growing market since 2009, which is possibly the longest uptrend I have ever seen, and prices for assets are extremely high. Overall, I see a positive long term and a cautious short term in the real estate market in Mexico.</p><h4>What opportunities or challenges does this price adjustment present for MIRA?</h4><p>Fortunately, MIRA is capitalized; we placed an investment project certificate (CerPI) for the first time, and thus far it is the only CerPI in the market in 2017. We will have a long time to invest that money. An adjustment would, therefore, be positive from that perspective. In terms of our ongoing projects, we have a large portfolio that is in operation, and those assets would be impacted negatively in the short term; however, given our long-term perspective we would be able to keep up the business without any problems.</p><h4>What are the advantages and disadvantages of issuing a CerPI against other possible financial vehicles for the real estate market?</h4><p>There are multiple options in the public market, including submitting an IPO, which we did not consider because in our business it is not common to see companies going public. This left us with certificates of development capital (CKD) or CerPIs. Most of our assets are designed for sale, and FIBRAs are designed for income-producing assets, which are only a portion of our portfolio. To raise capital for our business, we could go private with individuals, though that is so capital-intensive that the amount of money that is needed is significantly greater than individuals are able to fund. We needed to go to institutions, which are CerPI or the CKD. CerPIs required that we co-invest at least 30% of the fund with financial institutions, and in exchange, there is greater discretion over the type of investments that one can make. Furthermore, at that time there were 25 CKDs ahead of us</p><h4>Why did you focus on mixed-use developments, and do you foresee this becoming the norm in the market?</h4><p>In fact, we call them communities because our projects are huge; for example, one had 1,300 residential units and 100,000sqm of office and retail space. Often, there are mixed-use projects that are just one building with many uses. In our case, we develop a real community with multiple buildings and multiple uses. For the scale of projects that we do, we always mix, and it always makes sense to mix uses to build a more attractive environment. For example, in the project Neuchatel in Polanco, there will be a 300m-long pedestrian mall with stores, restaurants, and buildings around it providing shade and a secure environment. Given that our company works to develop large communities, we foresee them continuing to be mixed-uses</p><h4>How do you make sure the entire project is integrated with the rest of the city and is accessible through different means of transport?</h4><p>A great deal of what we focus on is the city dynamics. We want to be where there is infrastructure, job generation, and schools, and that is what we look for: old factories or large tracks of land. We do not want to develop outside the urban ring. During the site selection process, we look for areas that have excellent transportation, infrastructure, schools, and jobs. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why did Marhnos transition from a construction company to a real estate developer?</h4><p>We had been in the construction market for 64 years, and it is still a major part of what we do and in our DNA. Throughout this time, we have completed build-to-suit projects, such as consulates for the US government 40 years ago, not to mention projects for industrial players, such as Grupo Bimbo and Frialsa. We have done many real estate developments and developments on the infrastructure side. The margins are getting tougher and tighter every day for third parties, but we have skills throughout the value chain and expertise to use them. Marhnos is still building, but as a developer, and we see there is much more value creation within the whole development packaging.</p><h4>What are the main infrastructure gaps in Mexico, and how does Marhnos contribute to fill them?</h4><p>The greatest opportunity is creating an agency dedicated to PPPs for the country to have a long-term infrastructure plan. There are several 30-year infrastructure plans done by previous administrations and the School of Civil Engineers; however, it is never too late to have one plan that is really accepted by all infrastructure stakeholders. As of now, we need to wait for the new government and bring it on board to create this long-term strategic view, not to mention the different stakeholders. Typically, it is just the government and the constructors who get involved, but really there is much more to it, including consulting and legal firms, institutional investors such as commercial and development banks, and operators such as ourselves. Then, we need a PPP office, which was partly started with the Ministry of Finance in 2017. That office needs to start centralizing some of the norms and identifying the main features and characteristics of PPPs. The country also needs to look at social infrastructure in terms of how we support our service, manufacturing, and logistics platform in Mexico. For this, we need infrastructure like hospitals and waste-water treatment. That said, the PPP law is good. In terms of enforcement, we have sufficient regulations and are where we should be</p><h4>How do you integrate your projects with their surroundings?</h4><p>For all our residential projects, we try to ensure we are close to a bus or metro stop so there is access and mobility. On the logistics side, a project has to be on the outskirts of a city because it is industrial. For office projects, we aim to be centrally located. We are also looking at doing some government buildings where we want to change the concept and build an actual public space—a park or an area for open-air concerts or other cultural activities</p><h4>As a privately-owned company, can you tell us about your strategy to raise funds?</h4><p>For the larger housing projects, we invite certain funds to participate. For example, Gava, which is a fund from Monterrey, and Peninsula Fund from Miami, which is also focused on investing in Latin America. Our infrastructure unit has issued a Certificate of Capital Development (CKD). For our first CKD we invested 30% while other investors accounted to 70%.</p><h4>What are your goals for 2018?</h4><p>In 2018, we won two projects from the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS), of which one is a 38,000-sqm, 260-bed development in the metropolitan area of Monterrey. We will do part of the construction for that. We will also build another 260-bed, 38,000-sqm hospital in the north of Mexico City. We are also looking at road projects in Guatemala and hospital projects in Peru. Colombia could also be a possibility. Our housing unit has eight projects underway in Mexico City and three in Guadalajara, where we are opening a new office. In our PPP unit, we are still looking for projects in different states of Mexico. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are Venit's strategies for expanding in Querétaro and other cities of similar size?</h4><p>Querétaro has been taking up a great deal of our time, and it is growing steadil, in fact, faster than most of the country. We have been developing projects in the city faster than we thought. We started four projects in 2017 just in Querétaro alone, so there is still a great deal of room here, and it will not slow down for at least the next five to 10 years. The service, technology, automobile, and aerospace industries are experiencing strong growth in Mexico and Querétaro. Querétaro will be one of our main places to develop for the mid-term. However, we are not abandoning the other cities; we did start several small projects in a few cities, and Monterrey is coming back to us with some exciting opportunities, along with exciting projects in León, Zacatecas, and Mérida. </p><h4>What trends do you notice in the local housing sector?</h4><p>As the population that wants to rent increases and becomes more mainstream, the rental business will be more institutionalized. Currently, there are mostly 'mom-and-pop' type rental businesses. The entire business of student housing was informal a few years ago. Now, there are projects being developed and tailor made just for that. A few years ago, we did one in Monterrey and are currently working on one in Querétaro. As more and more people move to cities, almost the entire spectrum of rental housing will grow. This is an interesting trend that is just starting, though I do not see it booming in the next year or so.</p><h4>How have you seen the office segment increase in sophistication?</h4><p>Office space is still exciting. In terms of sophistication as a real estate market, more people want to have their offices in corporate buildings with security and amenities. Just as more people want better housing or better commercial space, more people seek better office spaces, which gives us  great potential. Mexico City is seeking to pass a law to allow buildings to be built without any parking space. It seeks to encourage people not to use cars, which is a great thing; these changes will be interesting for the real estate sector in the coming years</p><h4>How would you assess the current investment climate in real estate?</h4><p>The investment climate has changed significantly. The Trump factor and the rising costs due to a stronger dollar caused many investors to wait. However, more people have faith in real estate as a long-term investment. There is a great deal of cash in the market, and not just in Mexico; real estate is an interesting place for investment. Fibras and the growing sophistication of the market are coming together to make the real estate market boom.</p><h4>What are your expectations and priorities for 2018?</h4><p>Apartments will make up a large portion of our market share and our business model, and we will develop many apartments for the next three years. In the coming year, we are starting between four and five projects that are solely focused on apartment buildings. We are also looking at more opportunities in office space. We have two business models in office for rental and sales. In Monterrey, many people do not want to rent and prefer to buy so we are looking into it and working out something truly great. Hopefully, we will start a couple of new projects around 1H2018, one in Monterrey and one in Querétaro in office space. Housing and offices will be our main focuses as they are not impacted as easily as retail; the growing business climate creates a need for office space and we are looking forward to fulfill that supply-demand gap.  </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As a developer in the freezone space, how do you see the landscape for investment evolving over the next few years?</h4><p><span></span>Costa Rica is supporting business and our economy is growing every year, as we depend more and more on Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). The new government has been focused on maintaining rules for foreign investors and we will not see any major changes to Costa Rica's tax structure nor laws that would make conditions worse for foreign companies. We are confident that the current government will continue to promote international investment. The president has been outspoken about the companies that are already here, saying he will continue to support their investments. In our sector, we see many new companies coming in, or expanding their operations in the country, and our pipeline is strong. The international community is bullish on Costa Rica sustaining growth and, even an expected depreciation of our currency (the colón), would make foreign companies more competitive. Additionally, Costa Rica continues to be a safe and stable country on a political level, with a high-level quality workforce that also draws the attention of the companies to invest. </p><h4>When it comes to navigating the legal framework, what would your advice be for a foreign investor?</h4><p><span></span>Being local continues to be a great asset. In this case, Costa Rica's current structure favors local partners. That applies all over the world. We have had a lot of experience with hospitality developers coming to Costa Rica that struggle with concession plans, as well as the permit process that they need to complete to have a successful project. If a private investor purchases a piece of land somewhere, it can be difficult to establish itself without a local partner. Many years ago, we learned how important it is to take care of our communities. We learned the hard way that, having community involvement and social participation, is critical. It is not necessarily something all companies have in their culture, but it is a major factor when it comes to carrying out a high-profile project that can affect local communities. Some projects can be of public interest and the numbers should explain to the communities what the purpose of the investment is, what is going to be done, and how it contributes to making Costa Rica a better place. If a company can keep its promises, its chances of success are higher. Some people have trouble grasping the concept of concessions, but the fact remains that, if we do not offer concessions for some of the required infrastructure, we will not have new roads. We simply cannot afford to do it ourselves.</p><h4>What should be the private sector's role in advancing the national agenda, and where is the most opportunity for investment in sectors that will support it?</h4><p><span></span>It is no secret Costa Rica has infrastructure issues. The areas that need to be more involved are infrastructure and energy, which are critical aspects of our economy and will make us more competitive. If we speed up the permit process in general, we will see a lot of investment ready to fund projects that are waiting for approval. There are many skills in the private sector that could be used by the government to promote the economy and create jobs. SMEs typically avoid taxes by staying small, but once they cross the threshold into becoming a legal tax-compliant company, they struggle. Costa Rica is also investing into more value-added products and services and moving away from manufacturing to R&amp;D-led activities.</p><h4>What has been the commercial factor that has led you to impact the economy in the way that you have?</h4><p><span></span>We have been able to deliver an important amount of square footage on time and on budget for the companies interested in being part of our projects. They trust us; they know that when we commit, we will follow through on our promise. It also has to do with understanding Costa Rica's ecosystem and forecasting the future commercial and professional real estate landscape. For example, we invested first in office space in the area of El Cafetal; specifically in Belen, Heredia. There are now many projects coming to that area, including our work to introduce El Cafetal 2 and El Cafetal 3. We invested a lot of time in identifying what the companies would need and did a lot of research on how to solve those problems. As companies become more sophisticated, they start to compete for labor and companies have to be more attractive, with the right amenities and the right environment. We see turnover rates as low as 3% in our developments, where the market rate is 17%. We prefer to take on just a few projects, so we can work on them with our best people. That way, even I can get personally involved with everything we do.</p><h4>Why is it important for Garnier &amp; Garnier to have a strong, powerful brand that inspires the rest of the market?</h4><p><span></span>If we can run our business with a purpose, we can inspire everyone around us, even the companies that watch us from outside. In getting certifications, it is about understanding that we can continue to innovate and get better, with a vision of purpose that gets everyone inspired to get involved. It is about having a great culture. Our team feels that and that makes us confident in our ability to solve problems. We certainly face challenges every day in our projects; some things go well and other things go wrong. However, our ability to tackle those things and move forward comes from within. Once we have that internally, it spreads outside of the company. We try to transmit it to the other companies we work with and they see it.</p><h4>There are companies that tend to take a flagship role for their country. Garnier &amp; Garnier is one of those for Costa Rica. What impact would you like to make on the country?</h4><p><span></span>I believe that it starts with how we impact the lives of our employees and how they, in turn, engage with the company. We want to make Costa Rica a better place. That starts with our employees and spills directly into the communities in which we are involved with.</p><h4>What is the status of your current projects, and where do you expect them to be in 2019?</h4><p><span></span>Zona Franca La Lima, including its new Corporate Center in Cartago, remains our biggest focus. Additionally, we are also working on the development of phase two of the El Cafetal Corporate Center, in Belen Heredia. We are starting the construction on its second building and we hope to have the third one ready in 2019. A third project of great importance, which is still under development, is the Santa Ana Country Club (SACC). This is a social and sports club that was conceived as a solutions hub, focused on the wellness of those who visit it and on the protection of the environment. It is the only club in Costa Rica that is built with a sustainability criterion, starting from its design stage to its construction. Recently, it became the first private project to receive the Category XV Ecological Blue Flag: Sustainable Construction, for its construction phase. Under this philosophy, it will preserve seven of its eight hectares for the enjoyment of nature, sports, recreation, and relaxation. Its construction began in May 2017 and is expected to end at the beginning of 2019. Additionally, we are developing the new campus of the Universidad Latina of Costa Rica in Heredia, on the south side of the current campus, which has a 1.5ha construction area. It is a five-story building and it is estimated that it will be ready during the first quarter of 2019. We have an upcoming project in front of the national stadium that will be a mixed-use project. We will develop the land for the remainder of 2018. We are back in the hospitality sector after a short break. We have four hotels in the pipeline. It is not a change in strategy; being diversified has always been one of our main drives. We continue to push Hacienda Espinal, which is a project of 130ha for townhouses and residences. We probably will sign our first international deal in 2019 in Mexico or the US.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Digital advertising in Nigeria]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[oluwaseyi-tinubu-ceo-and-founder-loatsad-promomedia]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How was Loatsad Promomedia established?</h4><p><span></span>Loatsad Promomedia was an idea birthed by my business partner and I some four and a half years ago. We had a passion to create something that would be innovative and unique as well as providing a platform to start a business, which we both wanted to do. Hence, we got the license and set up our business. Eventually, we grew from just being static boards and lamp posts to LEDs. We realized there was a new market for us to enter. People were using the traditional methods of putting up a board, and we wanted to enter the space and make a change, giving advertisers something significantly more powerful for their brand. We wanted to create something powerful for them.</p><h4>Why did you choose to enter advertising?</h4><p><span></span>I studied Law in university but I wanted to break away from the norm and do something that will be innovative and improve Nigeria as a whole and also grow outside of Nigeria and throughout the continent, which was advertising. PricewaterhouseCoopers media research has stated that advertising revenues will double in Nigeria. In the short time we have been in the market, we have made a significant impact, as Outdoor advertising contains both boards and digital aspects. Digital is the future, and we are the future—we are the youngest in the game here. We do have a digital division and work with many international digital companies that we have brought to Nigeria. I believe the companies that will make an impact are those that consistently provide great value for money for their clients and work in tandem to ensure all their needs are adequately met.</p><h4>What is the composition of your portfolio in terms of digital versus billboards?</h4><p><span></span>Digital is still in the early stages in Nigeria; the country is extremely traditional. There's the need for some education because people mostly trust what they are used to. However, the advertising industry has evolved and modern technologies have opened the door to a whole new era, almost everyone uses mobile phones now and people are starting to be more open to concepts involving digital solutions. Nigerians like to see and touch; thus, the outdoor segment is still very much the leader in the country. Nigeria is still developing and the country is constantly evolving. Based on the numbers, Nigeria's population is going to continue to rise which means more opportunities for businesses and that leads to increased demand for our services. There will be significantly more demand for advertising here in the future, especially for digital advertising.</p><h4>How did you manage to take your position in the market in only four years?</h4><p>It has taken a great deal of hard work. Most importantly, it has been about having the right team. We are a young workforce, driven, and with a great deal of passion. Everyone at the company is involved in decision making and finding locations. We sit as a group and try to find out what is missing in the country or where we could have a presence. We are persistent and tenacious and we believe we offer real value. Our aim is to let brands thrive in the best possible way and we see our services as a unique medium to facilitate that process.</p><h4>What growth ambitions do you have?</h4><p><span></span>We are picking up on outdoor advertising, though we are also moving into digital and are working to push digital much more now. We are working on traditional popups on websites and phones. We want to eventually move outside of Nigeria and into other African countries. I want Loatsad to be an African brand and eventually move up into Europe and all around the world. In Africa, we are looking at moving first into Ghana, then to Kenya and South Africa.</p><h4>What trends have you seen in recent years in the sector in the country?</h4><p>There is an overall shift in innovative solutions that deliver real brand value. Organizations are not looking for a one size fits all approach. Instead, they are interested in strategic tailored solutions that impact their bottom line in a real way. There is a great deal of disruption and innovation in the sector at the moment. I believe that Loatsad Promomedia has been at the forefront of that innovation from day one. Outdoor advertising is growing rapidly and companies are looking to buy the best LED boards and get the most exposure. We always believe in going bigger and that has been our ethos from the very start with our structures, which are probably some of the biggest in Nigeria. others are now following suit. Many of the new structures that are coming up now are bigger than ever before. With the economy picking up, we have more clients coming back now. We want to make sure we are open to both local SMEs and major multinational corporations. We want to target both segments and adjust our rates accordingly.</p><h4>How do you secure the ideal location for boards?</h4><p><span></span>I will use the Victoria Island-Lekki toll gate as an example. The toll gate came up as an area with a great deal of traffic. For this, we first had to identify the owner of the asset. It belonged to LCC, and we proposed a concept of putting an LED on the structure. We also approached Lagos State Signage and Advertisement Agency (LASAA), the regulatory body. Once we figured out what was doable, we created the contract and signed out the concession. We currently are working on five new sites that will be up soon. We are typically approached by advertising agencies as opposed to a client itself. Loatsad has about every top client in the county. We have Access Bank, Coca-Cola, Pepsi, 9Mobile, MTN and many more. We have also held concerts and events with young artists and entrepreneurs.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2019?</h4><p>For Loatsad, 2019 will be a better year than the last four, we expect to create more iconic sites and to expand on our digital offerings as well. We hope to give more brands better locations for advertising opportunities; also, to have more strategic partnerships. We want to light Lagos up.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[innovating-security-solutions]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How important is the Mexican market for Axis' global sales strategy? </h4><p>For Axis, the Americas account for more than half of yearly revenue. Based on that, Mexico as an emerging market is important for the company. In 2017, we had the honor of being named one of the most important emerging market countries for the organization, and it has been aggressively growing in the last years, so we have great expectations for the coming years. Our growth has been between 10% and 20% a year over the last five years, mostly due to our three strategic pillars: global leadership, long-term relationships, and innovation. We talk about creating innovative solutions for the industry not only for small businesses, but for medium and large enterprises as well.</p><h4>What is the profile of your clients in Mexico?</h4><p>There is no specific profile because we are in a basic needs market, in the sense that everyone needs security. We have several verticals in which we are growing, and one of them is retail, a main market in Mexico and the region. We have critical infrastructure, and in that sector one can find all the power and electricity companies, gas stations, train stations, and transportation hubs, not to mention all government institutions—including smart cities. All these require surveillance. Another sector that is growing is the industrial sector. Video has evolved from deterrents to prevention since the Twin Tower attacks. This is why you have analytics and different security tools that you can take advantage of. You do not need thousands of people watching TV monitors to see if there is something going on. We have access to solutions that include audio, analytics, software, storage, and many different components for creative and efficient solutions based on customers' needs. </p><h4>To what extent is video surveillance and Axis helping to fight crime in Mexico?</h4><p>Deterrents are still necessary to some extent. However, the adoption of internet protocol (IP) technology gets higher all the time, and deterrents are not a factor to avoiding crime. Nowadays, you have a lot of crime recorded not only on cameras but also cell phones, none of which is stopping crime. However, tools such as loitering analytics can help prevent crime. This is actionable intel. Eventually innovation creates a barrier for many criminals, while a mix of technology and human resources can prevent crime in public areas.  </p><h4>What is your priority in terms of innovation, and what new products are you bringing to the market?</h4><p>There are several industry trends, one of which is the adoption of IP technology. Mexico is one of the most developed countries in terms of IP solutions; around 70% of new systems are IP-based. The other area is multi-megapixel cameras, which compiles more information in small pieces. Another trend is intelligent codecs, which helps you transport more information in a small bandwidth. </p><h4>What are your goals for 2018?</h4><p>To continue developing our value-added services for our partners, since we have an indirect sales model. We have to create more value for our partners and end users as well. We are also looking to strengthen our ecosystem. As for social responsibility, we as a company are committed to our community. We donate products, help certain associations, and participate in many others through industry platform development. We are part of Alas, ASIS, the intelligent building association, and many others that are trying to create value for and professionalize the industry. </p><h4>How do you work to promote best practices in the case of data privacy?</h4><p>We take the general data protection regulation extremely seriously. With the GDPR, all our employees, including sales associates, go out to the market and share information with our partners and end users. We are also part of the 10 principles of the UN Global Compact and business ethics initiatives, which have helped sustain the company for many years. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Providing  Secure Networks]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[providing-secure-networks]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the relevance of Mexico for Motorola Solutions' global sales strategy?</h4><p>We have been in the country for almost 60 years, and Mexico takes a major share of what we are doing in the region. However, we are facing challenges here in terms of how regulations are going to allow free competition in terms of radio networks for public safety. In general, we have a strong footprint in the country. We already have large strategic accounts such as the military, navy, and office of the attorney general. They use our technology for mission-critical communications. There are also several states that use our technology for public safety. We see a major opportunity in terms of how states are shifting from old to new technology based on international standards. </p><h4>Motorola Solutions' global sales rose 6% in 2017. How did Mexico perform within this positive context? What are the main drivers of your growth in the country?</h4><p>In Mexico, we have seen consistent growth for the last three years and have been shifting the way mission-critical communications are being done successfully, especially vis-í -vis the federal government. To have the confidence of the navy and military is a significant step for us. The challenge is still with states, and the fact is that many of them have not been able to change since there are still some obstacles for federal funding access. </p><h4>What are Motorola's priorities in terms of innovation?</h4><p>The top priority is integrating broadband and narrow band networks. We are proposing a highly secured Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) for the country for public safety. We are bringing together these two worlds and providing our clients with devices, either radios or smartphones, that can also use applications created by us. We are one of the few manufacturers that can provide a complete solution of networks, devices, and applications. </p><h4>How will the Red Compartida (shared network) initiative shake up the telecommunications market?</h4><p>It will enable many innovations the country needs. It was not until now that the infrastructure capable of transmitting all that information was available. Before, it was only possible to use the carrier's network. That network has different types of technology: 2G, 3G, 4G, and LTE. The quality of service for that varies depending on where you are. When talking about mission-critical communications, it is necessary to have a high quality of service. In the case of the Red Compartida, or shared network, it is a strong network because it has 90MHz of the band of 700MHz, and is designed to transmit large volumes of data at a high velocity. </p><h4>What opportunities does Red Compartida represent for Motorola Solutions?</h4><p>If the government decides to improve the radio network to a standard-based technology, such as P25, it will enable much better communication to immigration and police authorities and modernize the entire communications system for the country. P25 is a narrow-band technology that can connect directly and transparently, core to core, to LTE. We have developed a platform that will enable communications regardless of the terminal being used. For police forces, it is important to know where the units are. Our solution has an integrated map where agencies can see the location of each of their elements and see what type of device they are using: radio, smartphone, or laptop. </p><h4>What is the main driver of your growth right now?</h4><p>It is well balanced between the public and private sectors. We saw a slowdown when Pemex was in a slowdown due to its industry transformation, although it has started to grow again. The public sector is growing not just because of the radio solutions we provide but also because of the software we offer. Many of our clients are discovering that we can also provide a full command center for a state. We can provide them with dispatch solutions that allow the user to administer every incident they receive. Our solutions allow people to not just call 911 but to also send texts or images. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How relevant is the domestic market in Mexico for Air France-KLM's global strategy?</h4><p>For Air France—KLM, Mexico has proven to be a strategic market, and in 2017 we celebrated 65 years of operations of both Air France and KLM in Mexico City. The most recent example of a big investment from the group was the decision by Air France to operate the largest aircraft in our fleet here, the Airbus A380, which is the biggest airplane in the world with 516 seats. We operated the first flight in January 2016, and since then have been increasing our operations with the A380. We first started to operate in combination with a Boeing 777; however, the results have been so strong with the A380 that we now operate it every day all-year around.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about the recent evolution of market share for Air France—KLM between Mexico and Europe?<br></h4><p>We are in a dynamic market, specifically on the flows between Mexico and Europe. This market has grown 6-7% per year over the past decade, showing significant growth. In 2017 alone, we saw over 10% growth for transport between Mexico and Europe at an industry-wide level. This is a market evolution on which we want to capitalize, especially as we are for the first-time number one in the market for Mexico to Europe in terms of passengers transported, a position we intend to keep in 2018. Of course, we are grateful for the trust of our Mexican clients to choose Air France—KLM, which validates the investment we made in the country, especially with the Airbus A380. With our partners Alitalia and Delta, we have more than 30% market share, Air France—KLM alone counting for 25%. Together, this four-way joint venture between Europe, Canada, the US, and Mexico shares costs and revenues and coordinates routes and schedules to give customers more choices. </p><h4>Do you see any opportunities for further expansion of your operations in Mexico?<br></h4><p>There will be the new airport in Mexico City, which is a key topic for us because the current one is in a situation of saturation. The new one will be able to meet the ambitions and potential of the country. Mexico is a large country that goes well beyond Mexico City alone, and Air France has operated the Cancún-Paris route since 2011. In addition to our direct flights, we have a successful cooperation with Aeromexico for local connections. It carries a significant volume because on average, 20% of our passengers connect to Mexican cities other than Mexico City. </p><h4>How does Air France—KLM contribute to and capitalize on the success of Mexican tourism?</h4><p>Flows from Europe to Mexico have increased tremendously over the past two years, to which Air France—KLM has clearly contributed. If you take the Cancún-Paris route, 95% of the passengers are European tourists coming to enjoy Yucatán's culture, gastronomy, and beaches. When we increased the capacity of our Cancún route last year by 40%, we also increased the number of European tourists visiting Yucatán by 40%. Indeed, the number of European passengers that Air France—KLM transported in the last two years to Mexico has increased by 30%. This is a clear and key contribution to the Mexican tourism sector and economy.</p><h4>What are your goals for 2018?</h4><p>Our first objective is to remain number one from Mexico to Europe. Second, we want to further improve our customer intimacy with even more personalized services at every stage of our passengers' journey. We will open a third lounge at Mexico City's airport together with our partner Ground Lounge Elite. Also, we are in the process of upgrading our offerings in terms of food and beverage on Air France flights to share even more French culture and identity. Such initiatives are key to keeping the loyalty of our customers in the long term. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main funding sources for both operation and construction in the subway system?</h4><p>The Metro Public Transport System has several financing sources, but the biggest chunk, which is used for operation, maintenance, and expansion, comes from the city administration. Our total annual budget is around MXN17 billion; while grants make up around 50% of it, the rest is financed by ticket sales. On average, 5.5 million people use the subway on a daily basis, with the majority paying MXN5 per trip. Since students are charged MXN3 per trip and disabled and elderly are provided free service, the transport system requires specific allowances. The federal government, through the Chamber of Deputies, allocates resources from the federal budget, including the Capital City Fund and some other funds that cover 10% of the budget. However, the total budget fails to reach our target of MXN20 billion.</p><h4>What is the strategy to raise the present MXN17 billion to the target MXN20 billion? Have you explored the possibility of private sector engagement in the expansion of the city subway system?</h4><p>For two years, we have been promoting public-private investment projects such as real estate development on subway stations and other projects. That would allow us to extend the list of properties and have an additional income. Currently, we gather revenues from advertising and business premises, but that makes up a small contribution. We are planning to boost that to attract more private investment and to generate both assets and income for the subway system. Moreover, we are negotiating with the federal government for the subway to be recognized as a metropolitan service; subsidies should not just come from the city administration but from Estado de México and the federal government as well, since around 2 million users are from different states of the country.</p><h4>To what extent are your real estate projects inspired by Hong Kong's 'Rail plus Property' model?</h4><p>We also take inspiration from Paris subway and other subway systems around the world where real estate development generates significant revenues. At present, private investors are constructing two buildings above Villa de Cortés station. The investors will be able to recoup their capital within 10 years. We are also working with the city government for the construction of Modal Transfer Centers to improve mobility between different transport systems such as the subway, Metrobús, and intercity buses. Greater mobility will attract a greater number of investors.</p><h4>How advanced is the process of automation of the subway system's various lines?</h4><p>With the help of local technicians and companies, we have updated the automatic piloting system from analog to digital. Unlike other subway systems around the world that faced problems in adapting modern technology, we choose a smooth upgrading process that did not disturb other lines. There is one issue in Mexico City: the type of soil leads to recurring water filtrations. In order to tackle that, we are using new civil engineering techniques for a waterproof tunnel.</p><h4>How is the energy supply for the subway system, and what are the updates on the plan to generate energy through waste?</h4><p>Around 90% of the energy is provided by Federal Power Commission (CFE). The massive waste energy facility will turn 4,400 tons of solid waste into electricity, enough to fulfill the entire energy demand of the subway system. The project will be operated by Veolia and its construction is supposed to start from 2019.</p><h4>How successful is the integrated fare system? How did the users take it?</h4><p>Overall, the users highly appreciated it. We have a universal card operated by MasterCard that works as a debit card and allows the users to access the subway, Metrobús, and bus systems. This innovation started recently in November 2017, and we have sold more than 1 million cards. Moreover, we also cooperate with Metrobús and Ecobici (public bicycles) to exchange information about travel patterns in order to improve the service. This enables us to make decisions regarding the operation of the system. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance of Mexico for TIBA's global strategy?</h4><p>Mexico was the first country outside of Europe where TIBA opened an office. It was a strategic decision at that time to expand into the Americas and especially Mexico, where we saw huge potential. Today, we continue to see huge potential in Mexico. Within TIBA, Mexico is a key country where we continue to invest. It is part of our fundamental structure for the future.</p><h4>How would you assess the process of automation in the logistics sector?</h4><p>When the workforce is expensive then automation makes a great deal of sense. When we look at more developed markets in Europe or the US, automation makes more sense, where certain procedures are more standardized and simple. We invest heavily in technology in looking for ways to automate as many processes as possible to make our business more efficient. To automate the entire process in some countries is quite a challenge, and some of the countries where TIBA is present will not be completely automated in the near future.</p><h4>What is the main issue foreign companies face when moving goods in and out of Mexico and how does TIBA help in this area?</h4><p>Customs has always been a challenge in Mexico and continues to be for many companies. There are certain programs that facilitate the import and export of goods, especially for larger companies such as Ford, Volkswagen, and others, which have certain preferences and benefits that they can apply for with Mexico to facilitate their imports and exports. There is, however, an entire separate group of companies, namely SMEs, which are truly the engine of the economies in the world. They do not have access to some of these programs so we focus a large part of our energy on providing our own solutions to these companies, which starts from studying their real requirements, such as where they import from, what they are doing with their goods, and who they sell to. We try to help them design the logistical and customs compliance requirements with our large and professional team within TIBA, which we continuously train to keep it up-to-date in tendencies, new laws, the structure of customs, and so on.</p><h4>What are the strengths and weaknesses of Mexican infrastructure?</h4><p>There are certainly some areas of opportunity within Mexico. The road infrastructure is certainly not homogeneous; some of the roads are somewhat dangerous and do not provide the quality they could. This causes problems with trucks and the efficiency of the logistics chain. The Mexican government is investing in the infrastructure though there is still a long way to go to be able to reach the standards of some of the countries around the world. At the end of the day, Mexico is a manufacturing hub with access to the east, west, north, and south and the largest economies such as the US, Central America, and the Caribbean. It can produce not just manufactured goods but perishable goods as well. For Mexico to be this manufacturing and merchandising production hub, it needs to have an extremely efficient logistics solution in place, and part of that is its infrastructure.</p><h4>How are the NAFTA renegotiations affecting TIBA's operations so far?</h4><p>It has affected us more through exchange rate matters because this affects consumer goods in Mexico. The volatility in the exchange rate definitely creates some confusion and uncertainty in the market for us.</p><p>What is your outlook for 2018 for TIBA?</p><p>2018 looks to be a fantastic year. We are extremely positive about many things that we see going on in Mexico. One of the major developments within TIBA is the project division for renewable energies, where we have a team of experts that knows the solar panel business extremely well. For 2018 we see a large amount of investment into wind and solar energy, and TIBA has some great professionals providing solutions for each of these sectors. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main highlights since you were appointed as the company's CEO one year ago? </h4><p>Altice was known as PT before it was acquired in 2015. One of the most important things for us with the new team was to change the way we were communicating or being perceived in the market. We increased our levels of communication and recognition in the market also because we are leaders in almost all segments of the industry. That was one of the key challenges and I believe we tackled that already because the recognition levels and our communication showed tremendous improvements after nine months. On a more business level, we faced continuing and new challenges. Since 2015, the company invested heavily in infrastructures for fiber-optic deployment and mobile network enhancement, and it continues to invest in infrastructure development. The challenge was to keep up with the levels of investment. For example, over the first three fiscal years we invested EUR1.2 billion in Portugal, and out of those EUR400 million were investment in infrastructure for fiber optic. Our continuous investment resulted in a great achievement in 1H2018, when we managed to capture 60% of the growth in the entire fixed retail market. Moreover, in the TV segment we managed to grow from a loss of 12,000 customers in 2Q2017 to recovering those and adding 6,000 new customers. For the mobile segment, we also increased our customer base, growing 125% since the acquisition with 38,000 new customers.</p><h4>The mobile sector is being led by MEO with 7.9 million out of 10.3 million mobile customers. What is your strategy?</h4><p>Altice's key strategy is to maintain a high ratio of investment in infrastructures because overall growth cannot be achieved unless we invest heavily on infrastructure development. Altice Portugal is the number one investor with EUR1.2 billion invested over the last three fiscal years. It is due to our investments that our mobile network can cover 98.5% of the Portuguese population with 4G, a high number for European standards. Equally important, the same infrastructure enables 70% coverage for next generation 4G+ services. However, we want to be recognized not just for our investments in infrastructure but also for our high quality of service. To that end, we are enhancing customer experience and driving initiatives that allow people to have self-service and digital approaches to customer service interactions. In addition to that our initiatives are focused on providing the best content, applications, solutions for the B2B market; we aim to create a system that can be scaled for large enterprises and SMEs. Portugal's business segment is largely comprised of small companies, so we cannot simply replicate a service offered to a major Portuguese bank for a small accounting shop.</p><h4>Altice is working with Huawei to make Portugal the European 5G leader. What can your customers expect from Altice in this regard?</h4><p>We have divided the country into north and south, and we are working with Huawei in the south and Ericsson in the north. With both of them, we have established two individual programs, collectively named the Road to 5G. The project has a head start as the current infrastructure covers 70% of the Portuguese population with 4G+, paving the path for an easy transition to 5G. We are now experimenting technologies and CPE's with Huawei. Notably, we conducted the first live demo with live 5G equipment in 1H2018 and it was a huge success. The company is looking forward to the implementation of 5G on a national level. However, we are not as eager to implement 5G as regulators, governments, or technology manufacturers because we invested around EUR100 million in modernizing our mobile network in 2016 and we first need to capitalize on that. We see 5G as a natural evolution that will come along in time and do not expect to have live commercial services before 2022. It is important to note that 5G is not about having more capacity—4G is sufficient for present demands—5G will address a different set of challenges, such as density and the number of devices that can be connected within 1sqkm. I do not expect 5G to be massive for retail customers, it will be a good evolution for new sets of businesses that would incorporate the Internet of Things and Machine to Machine communication.</p><h4>How do you see 2018 ending and what are your priorities for 2019?</h4><p>2Q2018 results were in line with our expectations. We are getting back to growth in terms of operational KPIs, market shares, and customer base. The company has witnessed a reduction in the total turnover over the last two years, but this is normal. The Portuguese market has three main players and if not in 2018, Altice will also become the leader in the TV segment in 2019.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the challenges of developing the Mex Rent-a-Car brand?</h4><p>We knew it was hard to compete with the large companies, because they were merging and becoming more powerful. We created our own brand to control our own future by being in charge of our own technology and costs. We created our own system and hired engineers to develop this idea. Right now in 2017 we have 20 locations in Mexico and two in the US. We were the first Mexican car rental company to open at the CBX San Diego crossing. Since 95% of our customers are Mexican, we thought they would be more comfortable renting from a Mexican company when traveling to the US. We have also an alliance with Fox Rent a Car, called MexAlliance. Our customers make reservations via Fox's system and we accept those reservations for both Mexico and the US.</p><h4>What is your client profile?</h4><p>Our client profile has been focused on Mexican business travelers and tourists, though it is not just limited to these. As a result of the internet, we see more interest from clients from the US and Canada. We have travelers from all around the world that choose Mex Rent-a-Car when coming to Mexico. Around 92% of our clients are individuals for business and leisure. Around 8% of our revenue comes from corporations, mainly Mexican. We have also corporate clients that are multinational and hire our services for several months in a row for their representatives who come to Mexico for business. There is great potential in corporate clients; however, we are more focused on leisure and have seen an explosive growth of Mexicans traveling within Mexico. In January 2016, Kayak saw an increase of 170% of locals seeking to travel within Mexico, while international destinations saw a 67% increase</p><h4>How do you target your customers in terms of trends in the tourism sector?</h4><p>We have a plan for the next three to five years. We are focused on growing with our alliance. We plan to launch two new brands in Mexico, one of which is MTT, focused on the on-demand rental product. We are focused on technology and want to launch this brand this year, which will enable users to reserve and pay through a mobile app. Also we will launch another brand called MGT or Mex Ground Transportation. There are special segments of the market that do not want to drive in Mexico, so this brand targets this segment. We plan to achieve a 95% growth in units and 120% in revenue by 2020</p><h4>What distinguishes Mex Rent-a-Car from your competitors?</h4><p>Technology is our forte. With our app, it is easier for customers to reserve cars and make payments. We offer an all-inclusive product. We recognize that in the market it is difficult for customers to understand what it is included in rental fees; others add insurance and other fees on prices. Our fares are all-inclusive, so customers do not need to worry about other fees. Our service includes cars, gasoline, and insurance, so when a customer comes they are ready to go.</p><h4>What your goals over the next few years?</h4><p>We have set a goal of 7,000 units and income of MXN1.5 billion by 2020. We want to penetrate the US market under the Mex brand. In terms of the development of the Mex brand through our affiliations, we will probably cover about 30-40 countries. Now we have eight countries that use the Mex technology and brand and have exposure on major websites like Expedia and rentalcar.com. They use our brand in Central America and the Caribbean as well as in Romania, our first country in Europe. We plan to grow in more countries, especially in Europe and the rest of the Americas. We seek to offer entire new experiences and mobility and are considering mixed solutions for cities like Mexico City with limited parking spaces, combining it with rentals by the hour or other means of transportation. The keys to our success are the expertise in administration of our founders, Francisco and Martha Garcí­a, as well as our partnership with Dalton in 2012, who have invested a great deal of money and believe in the technology we are developing, and our employees, who are our main key to future success. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your strategy to become the top tourism company in Latin America?<br></h4><p>We want to become the first vertically integrated tourism group with a central focus on the customer. We are expanding our geographic footprint, starting with Mexico, and now have offices in Sío Paolo, Buenos Aires, Bogotá, and Punta Cana. We have four main business lines. The first is bestday.com, our online travel agency. We also have what we call our B2B2C, our BD Travel Solution that seeks to power the booking engines of different industry players such as hotels or airlines. For example, we can do a hotel booking combined with round-trip airfare and create a package for those hotel partners that do not have that capability to put everything together. We are expanding to Latin America with that business line. In Mexico, we use BD Travel Solution with Aeroméxico, Volaris and Viva Aerobús as well as with large hotel chains such as AM Resorts brands and several others. We also do it in Mexico as a country under Visitmexico.com. This is a business line that is also growing rapidly in Latin America. Our third division is HotelDO, a hotel site for travel agencies, which promotes and sells Latin American products to the world. </p><h4>What criteria does Best Day use to set up shop in new markets? </h4><p>We analyze the larger markets, internet penetration, and active position of online travel groups in those destinations before combining all our Latin American business knowledge to choose markets with the potential to replicate our business model. We started in Argentina in 2010 through a merger with a group that had HotelDO. There was a division within HotelDO in Brazil, so we decided to go there next. Punta Cana is like another Cancún, and, therefore, it made a great deal of sense to open there as well. We had a great experience replicating our services and technology at these places. </p><h4>How does the company keep up with its philosophy of technology disruption?</h4><p>We created a division that we call “IN4H," or innovation for hospitality that is dedicated to keeping up with innovation and any new technologies that provide opportunities. This explores those opportunities in order to apply, customize, and localize any part of these innovations for our different business lines. We have an entire team dedicated to this kind of disruption. </p><h4>What are the factors behind the massive success in tourism to Mexico in recent years?</h4><p>We have a great deal of natural wonders to showcase alongside our culture, cuisine, and diverse country. The most important thing is that Mexicans are natural hosts. We are extremely hospitable, and it is natural to welcome visitors to our country. We have great products, traditions, culture, cuisine, and diverse landscapes, not to mention our deserts, beaches, jungles, and many other things that make the country a world on its own. Mexico truly has it all.</p><h4>What is your opinion on travel platforms such as Airbnb? How are they regulated in Mexico and Quintana Roo?<br></h4><p>We are all still learning about these social collaborations and shared economies in Mexico. It is something that is growing, and in terms of competitiveness, it is important to have everyone on the same page or else it is tough to compete. If there are many regulations and taxes on hotels that the shared economy does not pay, this is unequal. Still, it is an interesting development and we see a great deal of potential in that market. Competition is great—without competition one becomes complacent. Such platforms need to be better addressed to ensure they are fair to everyone. We do compete with such platforms and have a project we will launch in the same area. We want to improve on it and add services that these platforms do not currently have. For example, we are combining accommodation rental with flight and transportation services and offering optional activities such as car rentals. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-mandate-to-prosper]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What major changes in the ease of doing businesses can we expect after the recent elections?</h4><p>After several months of political uncertainty, Mexicans have decided their faith for the years to come. With Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador's victory, Mexico will face months of economic, social, and cultural changes. Although it is uncertain to which campaign promises Lopez Obrador will comply, Mexico is in standby mode. In the last few months, we have already seen foreign investment decrease or move to another markets. In the years to come, we should expect changes to the so-called structural reforms of Peña Nieto's administration, including law amendments to education, energy, and infrastructure, which will drive fiscal deficit and interest rates to new highs. According to several papers issued by Mexican banking and finance specialists, López Obrador's victory will likely be followed by slower growth, higher inflation, and a weaker peso. Notwithstanding, it is not unusual that politicians do not comply with their campaign promises, thus the Mexican economy and politics should be overseen with caution and step-by-step. </p><h4>What were the main changes to the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, and how will these modifications better serve Mexico's interests and priorities?</h4><p>One of the most significant revisions was in the intellectual property chapter. Needless to say, the main difference between CPTPP and the original Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is the number of individuals that the treaty will affect: without the US, the size of population under the treaty decreased almost by half. Under the revised IP chapter, we can find several provisions that went into suspension but were not canceled and were persistently driven by US and transnational companies. The main differences and main provisions of CPTPP include: a) companies will no longer have the chance to claim damages against local government decisions; b) copyright title holders' economic rights will remain for 50 years versus the original 70 years established under TPP, which benefits major international editorial, media, TV, film, and technology companies; c) signing parties will have more flexibility pertaining to patentability definitions; and d) the length of patent protection for innovative medicines and copyright periods for written materials has been shortened, and technology and information protections have been narrowed. The suspended provisions have removed the additional requirements (pursued by the US) in technological protection measures, rights management information, encrypted satellite and cable signals, and safe harbors for internet service providers. Although the agreement will not be as positive as expected with respect to elevating IP standards in Mexico, it remains a welcome development for international trade and for certain aspects of IP protection and regulatory matters.</p><h4>In 2017, the National Banking and Securities Commission (CNBV) announced some changes in the requirements foreign firms to acquire a banking license. What was the rationale, and what impact might it have on investment?</h4><p>These requirements were enacted to fight money laundering and pursue illicit money accounts. By establishing these new regulations, Mexico is complying with international treaties and directives. We have not seen any decrease in the investment arena as a consequence of these changes. The idea is to regulate, not over-regulate, and these were properly enacted for a higher purpose. </p><h4>Mexico recently updated its free trade agreement with the EU. How will this framework impact bilateral trade?<br></h4><p>Considering the re-negotiation of this international treaty, Mexican authorities have started to implement modifications, such as the amendments published on March 2018 in the Industrial Property Law. These amendments refer to some of the regulations regarding industrial models and designs, the recognition of Geographical Indications (GI), and the already recognized Appellations of Origin (AO). Traditionally, Mexico has protected Appellations of Origin, but this chapter of Mexican Law has been amended to include the respective rules for GI as a specific new tool of protection. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>According to your financial reports, 2017 was a record year for operating revenue. What were the main factors behind this growth?</h4><p>The group has been performing well in 2017, especially in the first semester, when we posted growth higher than 20%. Our main business in Mexico is fleet management. This segment has been growing significantly because we have a homologation from the tax administration; clients who use our services can deduct their fuel expenses by 100%. Our invoices are available for download so they do not have to get a fuel invoice every time they are at the station. The 10 largest fleets operate with us, but we also have 10,000 clients of various sizes. Our solution helps facilitate administrative work and helps prevent fraud. We are innovating as well, and we are launching a solution that is cardless. It is a tag that is attached to the windshield of the vehicles. The point of sale (PoS) recognizes the vehicle and makes the transaction immediately; we plan to commercialize it in 2018 for all of our clients. Our second business focus is the food voucher market, which is crucial for Mexican employees. We provide monthly food vouchers for over 3 million employees in Mexico. There is an app and a website where one can check their balance as well as many other features, such as locking or unlocking their cards online. This feature is something that the banks are launching now, though we launched it two years ago. Moreover, we launched an interesting platform in the US called NutriSavings, where a customer receives thorough and analyzed information on purchased items. While nutritious items win points, unhealthy foods do not. We can help people change their eating habits to become healthier and also save money; it is something completely feasible based on micro-change</p><h4>What do you offer for SMEs?</h4><p>We are working on developing a more comprehensive offer for SMEs. We hired a director a year and a half ago who works specifically for SMEs. Through a combination of her work and some promotion, we have multiplied the number of new SMEs using our services five or six fold. Recently, we formed a partnership with Aspel software, which is the largest accounting software provider for SMEs. Our travel solution is now 100% integrated with their software. Everything is paperless, and the solution is made so that the places where you pay can forward information directly to the platform</p><h4>What role does your company play in terms of tackling informality in the market?</h4><p>Globally, it is one of the main business drivers for our company, and even more so in Latin America. Our company is French, but almost 60% of the business is in Latin America. We developed rapidly in Brazil, Mexico, and many other countries in the region because we are fighting against informality. Now, as more users have cards instead of cash, they experience less street crime. The main retail chains are already formalized, though we help formalize the smaller businesses on street corners. If we manage to formalize the entire chain, it will definitely be positive for the economy. For example, 50% of the restaurant market in Mexico is informal and does not pay tax or follow health regulations</p><h4>How does the recent rebranding reflect what is happening inside the company?</h4><p>Edenred used to be part of a different company and part of a huge business of 160,000 employees, with 5,000 focused on this particular area. The branding and image had never been something that was important, and our logos were over 30 years old. We needed to clean off the dust to bring it up to date. It went from an old-fashioned voucher company to digital and technological company. The new branding is vibrant, young, and much more aligned to what we are doing now. The change of mentality has been well translated in the new brand image. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the decision behind rebranding the group?</h4><p>Established more than 35 years ago, Original Resorts quickly became one of the pioneers in adult vacation experiences and was rebranded into Original Group in 2016. The main objective behind this rebranding was to keep up with the company's continued growth and showcase its ever-expanding array of offerings. The company's branding relaunch includes a new name, a new logo, and an exciting new website detailing its hospitality collections aimed at a discerning, sensual clientele. Original Group currently boasts an impressive portfolio of brand labels including: Desire, Temptation, Premier vacation club, Swingee, Marina Hacienda Del Mar, and several additional real estate developments. Recently, the brand's adult-themed Temptation Cancún  Resort underwent 11 months of extensive renovations and reopened on August 15 with a new seven-story multicolor façade, upgraded guestrooms, its very own sexy pool, and much more. This beachfront all-inclusive property was the first one built in Cancún in 1974 and caters to adults over 21 who love to party in a free-spirited atmosphere. The multi-million-dollar enhancement project was led by world-renowned designer Karim Rashid and has redefined Cancun's skyline. Customers have responded extremely well to the renovation, and 65% of the hotel's business comes from existing customers, which is high for the industry</p><h4>How would you characterize Mexico's attractiveness in the adult tourism sector?</h4><p>During the last decade, adult-only resorts have been rising in popularity, and many hospitality brands have decided to adapt to this growing trend by creating adult-only resorts and spaces for its guests. OriginalGroup has been one of the pioneers in adult vacation experiences in Mexico, which offers a wide variety of adult-oriented properties ranging from hyper-luxurious retreats to fun-packed mega-resorts. Some of Mexico's most popular resort destinations include Cancún, Riviera Maya, and Los Cabos. These destinations are highly attractive for adult tourism due to its friendly locals, vast array of entertainment options, pristine beaches, and rich culture. They are also ideal for year-round travel due to its flight and accommodation accessibility. </p><h4>Can you tell us about your expansion plans in the cruise industry?</h4><p>Our Desire brand currently includes all-inclusive resorts Desire Riviera Maya Pearl Resort and Desire Riviera Maya Resort, along with Desire Venice Cruise and Desire Barcelona-Rome Cruise. Desire targets couples only, granting guests a unique, clothing-optional atmosphere, with a sense of freedom outside of conventional environments. These unique experiences include the latest in adult entertainment, provocative theme nights, couples' workshops, indoor/outdoor playrooms, gourmet dining, brand name beverage service, and much more. We recently took our adult-themed concept to sea for the first time ever with the Desire Venice Cruise, which sailed along the Adriatic Sea from September to October 2017. The voyage departed from and culminated in Venice, Italy, stopping in several ports in Croatia and Slovenia. Our next charter operation will set sail along the Mediterranean Sea in April 2018, departing from Barcelona and culminating in Rome. The company's future exp`ansion plans in the cruise industry aim to offer two cruises per year starting in 2018 for our Desire brand before proceeding to launch our Temptation cruise in 2020. The majority of our cruise customers are from Europe and the US, while the Mexican market makes up 10% of our clientele.</p><h4>What opportunities do you see in the development of your available land?</h4><p>Cancún's real estate market is booming, and Original Group is currently working on several developments including Puerto del Mar, which is located right next to Puerto Cancún. The Puerto Cancún project will offer between 3,000 to 5,000 units for sale, while Puerto del Mar will offer 2,000 apartments. Even though it's a smaller project, it will also represent smaller costs than those associated with Puerto Cancún. Cancún's hotel zone and Puerto Cancún are among the most expensive in Mexico, one of the reasons we aim to market Puerto del Mar.  </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How relevant is the Mexican market for your company's global sales strategy?</h4><p>For Chemours, Mexico is an extremely important country, and Latin America is an important region for our global strategy. In terms of sales, we sell about USD400 million in the Mexican market, though we also export to the world from Mexico about another USD400 million. We have an important titanium dioxide manufacturing facility here at Altamira, Tamaulipas, where we produce our Ti-Pure„¢ product brand. Three years ago, we made a USD560-million investment in that facility to build a second production line, and it was an extremely important and relevant investment for a company; in fact, this was the first investment for Chemours outside of North America. In the last two years, in addition to other investments, we started to build a new USD160-million facility to produce a chemical compound for the Mexican market</p><h4>What market will your recent investment in the new facility cover, and how will it complement your existing offerings?</h4><p>Chemours has three large business lines. One is Titanium Technologies, which is related to paints, plastics, laminate flooring, and paper. Another business is Fluoro products; we produce refrigerate gases and fluids that allow refrigerators and air conditioners to work for the supermarket and automotive industries, as well as for houses. Our brands are Opteon„¢ and Freon„¢. The other big segment in the fluoro product business is our Teflon brand products, which are used mainly for automotive, consumer electronics, wire and cable, houseware, and the oil and gas industries. Our third business is chemical solutions, and here we have one specific chemical compound under our mining solutions division that supports the development of the mining industry in Mexico.</p><h4>What are the main drivers of growth here, and which industries have the highest demand for chemical products?</h4><p>In 2017, Chemours was able to sell USD6.4 billion worth of products and grew about 15% YoY. The expectation is for 2018's EBITDA globally to be around 20% more than 2017's. We predict around 15% growth for Mexico, and there are four key drivers for this growth. One is the volume that is driven by the fact that industries in general are growing, and Chemours is the leader in those markets. We are related to the paint, refrigeration, and automotive industries, and most of our products are related to those industries that are core of the global economy. In 2018, we announced the first acquisition of Chemours in the world, which was done in the US and is focused on the refrigeration market. We are moving down the value chain and going downstream, which is extremely important if we want to bring solutions closer to our customers.</p><h4>What is your strategy in terms of the environmental impact of your facilities in Mexico?</h4><p>For a chemistry company such as Chemours, sustainability is relevant in terms of four key points. The first is our core values, and the most important thing is that we are an ethical company. We reinvented ourselves in 2015, though we have been operating for 200 years. We want to continue for another 200 years. The second key thing is how we operate our facilities around the world. We are focused on always taking care of the environment, the communities around us, our team members, and the people who work for us. The third point is related to the products that we create to enable a more sustainable world. The innovative products that we produce enable our customers to deliver solutions to key industries that are improving the lives of people everywhere. Chemours is catalyst for better. The last one is to have products that maintain their unique performance while reducing their environmental footprint. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your strategy to remain ahead of the competition?</h4><p>Daimler has been leading the innovation and new technologies for the automotive industry not only in Mexico but worldwide. Since 2016, we have been leading the market. In 2017, for example, our brand acquired 39.5% market share in classes six, seven, and eight. There are a few features that helped us gain the number-one position. We have an extraordinary product; our Freightliner products are recognized in the market as leaders in every segment. We also have an extraordinary dealership, with over 80 different sites around the whole country that not only provide attention in sales but also service maintenance aftersales. Number two is our strength in financial services, Daimler Financial Services. We also have diversity in terms of different fuel systems or power systems, though the quality is the result of our factories in Mexico.</p><h4>How is Mexico adapting to keep its industrial competitiveness in times of greater automation and digitalization?</h4><p>As Daimler is a significant manufacturer with a high number of employees, this is a relevant topic for us. We are used to seeing people installing components and parts; however, even with technology we will require people. We will need technicians to provide maintenance as well as developers to create those patterns for processes. We will need people who analyze processes and continue to make improvements to the robots' efficiency. Probably, the number of people will be lower, though the diversity of functions will be higher. We need to enhance education levels and orient our education system to new technologies and innovation. Some time ago, Daimler was a pioneer in a concept called dual education, wherein one simultaneously studies in schools and practices their skills in the real world. Now, we continue to enforce this for Daimler, particularly for Daimler Vehí­culos Comerciales México, and it is absolutely a significant part of our social responsibility efforts.</p><h4>What is the size of the Mexican domestic market in the big picture of your global commercial strategy?</h4><p>In the commercial market side, Mexico's market is not as big as it should be. To grow the market in Mexico for commercial vehicles, we need investment, both private and public. Specifically regarding public investment, Mexico needs investment in infrastructure, roads, rail, communication, and more. For this, trucks and drivers will be needed, jobs will be created, and the commercial vehicles industry will be reinforced. Furthermore, Mexico has an old truck fleet. Other countries have fleets aged between five and seven years, while the average in Mexico is 18 years. There are more than 400,000 commercial trucks registered in Mexico, and truck owners need government-sponsored incentives to renew fleets. In Mexico, 80% of transportation companies own fewer than 30 trucks and only 20% of the companies registered in Mexico are large companies. This 80% of companies with smaller fleets do not necessarily have access to credit, incentives, or the means to renew their fleets. The third is providing transporters, and the industry in general, with greater trust in security. Security on the roads is crucial.</p><h4>How do you cooperate with the Minister of the Environment to improve air quality in Mexican cities?</h4><p>On the issue of pollution and how to control it, Daimler Vehí­culos Comerciales México has been one of the promoters of moving to new emissions standards. The new regulation for emissions was recently published, establishing the emissions regulations for diesel engines. We will adopt the most recent European regulations and incorporate them in Mexico. However, there are a few issues to iron out before these regulations are implemented in 2021. If we do not have the diesel with the highest quality needed for this technology, then our efforts will not work. We are asking the authorities for extremely low sulfur diesel in every single gas station across the entire country. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[A Place of Sanctuary]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[a-place-of-sanctuary]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Mexico City has a number of international luxury hotel brands. What distinguishes you?</h4><p>Four Seasons Hotel Mexico City is the only hotel in the city that is part of an international luxury brand solely dedicated to the luxury segment. Therefore, all our guest rooms and suites, meeting rooms, outlets, public areas, amenities, and services are focused on such travelers and experiences. For example, to cater to our well-travelled guests, we have added Fifty Mils, one of the top bars in the city and the only hotel bar in Mexico City with international award-winning mixologists. We have also been recognized as the only Five Diamonds Hotel in the city by AAA. The iconic architecture of our building—a low-rise, hacienda style with a one-of-a-kind central garden that gives a unique sense of place and creates a feeling of sanctuary in one of the busiest cities of the world—also sets us apart from our competitors.</p><h4>How important is gastronomy to the guest experience? </h4><p>Gastronomy is paramount to us, as it is part of delivering unique experiences to our guests. We believe in delivering local experiences with an international know-how. As part of our full renovation project, we opened Zanaya Restaurant, which has become one of the top Mexican seafood restaurants in the capital, headed by talented Mexican chef Tonatiuh Cuevas. Its specialty is the fresh Zarandeado fish. We fly in our seafood products from the Mexican Pacific Coast daily and deliver a unique style and flavors from the state of Nayarit. We also have a high-end Mexican street gastro bar-type experience at our Fifty Mils Bar, which allows guests to savor typical Mexican street food in a safe and fantastic ambiance. Both venues have terraces that open out to our interior garden, further enhancing the dining atmosphere. </p><h4>What is behind the success of the tourism sector in Mexico? </h4><p>There are several factors that have contributed to Mexico's success; the most important is our people. Mexicans are a welcoming and service-oriented culture by nature. That has maintained our standing as the top destination to visit over the years. However, in the last few years the government and private sector have been more strategic in their marketing investments to increase the number of visitors to the country. Typically, Mexican beaches have been a magnet for guests around the world. Lately, other areas have followed suit, such as Mexico City, which has been found to be a top destination to travel to, not only for cultural or business reasons, but culinary and leisure ones as well. Social media and new communication channels such as blogs and websites specialized in sharing experiences and content from fellow travelers have opened the eyes of many others that used to be skeptical about certain areas of Mexico or were not even aware of their existence. Whatever the reasons, we are delighted that Mexico is taking its well-deserved place in international tourism.</p><h4>How are you adapting your business model to fit the desires of millennials, who may be more attracted to less-traditional, non-hotel services?</h4><p>We are extremely aware of the economic power that millennials represent at this point and how it will only increase in the coming years. To date, we have already implemented several changes in how we deliver the Four Seasons service in a more relevant way to them, such as a mobile app and chat that simplifies the check-in and check-out processes, as well as having direct communication with our employees that will directly deliver their personalized service. We have also implemented a millennial committee within the hotel to work on specific projects and service sequence adjustments that will allow us to better cater to this intuitive and adventurous market. In order to communicate these initiatives, we have worked on specific storytelling strategies distributed through specific channels targeted to them. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Industrial Footprint]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[industrial-footprint]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How relevant is the Mexican market for Thales' global strategy?</h4><p>Mexico is one of the few countries that have continued to grow over the last few years. We consider Mexico and Brazil our two major countries in the region. We have more than half of our headcount in Mexico. In terms of investment and industrial footprint, it is a country with enormous growth potential. We see it growing in the sectors we are involved in. Our industrial activities here are mostly focused on security and transportation, as well as air traffic management. On top of this, we are making headway in the defense sector, which we hope to develop more. Part of the Thales DNA traditionally comes from the defense sector. Even though Mexico is not a country that invests a large amount in its defense in terms of GDP, there are interesting projects that we hope to be a part of in the future.</p><h4>Why did the company decide to open its software development center for transportation and security here?</h4><p>We have been active in the transportation and security sectors in Mexico for a few decades. Globally, this is the center of excellence for our tolling and urban security activities. The objective of these hubs is to develop products and innovations such as big data, cybersecurity, and tolling solutions locally in order to be closer to our customers and propose solutions adapted to the Mexican market. Here, we can find excellent software development engineers and a strong need to develop the road infrastructure and secure cities and sensitive assets. Other countries in the region have a great need to continue to develop road infrastructure, and it is an area that will continue to grow. It is natural that in order to maintain an edge over our competitors, we need to invest in R&amp;D. Thales invests 20% of its earnings in R&amp;D.</p><h4>What is unique about your urban security project Ciudad Segura and what have been its results?</h4><p>This was a program that was signed in 2009 with the first batch of 8,000 cameras contracted by the government of Mexico City. In 2014, it was extended to encompass another 7,000 cameras, totaling 15,000. The system includes one C5, a large command and control center not far from the airport, and five regional C2s, located in different parts of the city, as well as two mobile C2s, a small-scale version. In addition to the 15,000 cameras, there are panic buttons and license plate cameras. We have seen a significant reduction in the authorities' response time. An intervention that previously took around 10 minutes has been reduced to three to four minutes. In terms of the delinquency rate in the city, there has been a reduction of more than 50% from 2010 to 2016. The general feeling among citizens is that it is now safer to walk around and that the authorities are more responsive. </p><h4>What are your goals for the coming year?</h4><p>We need to continue to grow our industrial footprint in Mexico. The first priority is to continue to grow in the area of expertise we have here locally. The fact that we are developing and bringing innovations to our customers implies that we need to preserve this image. We need to continue to invest in our local expertise, which means tolling and ticketing systems, urban security systems, critical infrastructure protection systems, and air traffic management systems. We also need to open our defense market. We have already had a few successes. This segment will continue to be a priority for the group as a whole. Together with my colleagues in Latin America, we will continue to grow the company's presence in the region. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Enhancing Mexico’s Future Potential]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[enhancing-mexicos-future-potential]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your assessment of the current penetration of cloud services in Mexican companies?</h4><p>In terms of the IT industry, the original principle was to deliver solutions where the complexity remained on the user's side. However, with the cloud solutions, the complexity went away so companies could concentrate on their core business and the cost dropped dramatically because it became easier to take advantage of economies of scale. The cloud is growing in Mexico by three digits, as is Oracle. We are making it more accessible to people, and now companies that are part of the middle or lower tier can afford to purchase a solution. Another aspect is complexity; the adoption rate of cloud in Mexico compared with the US or any other large economies is exactly the same or perhaps higher, because Mexican companies have leapfrogged to the cloud. We improve data security by reducing the danger of getting hacked, and thus, people are starting to realize that cloud solutions are more secure.</p><h4>What are your priorities in terms of research and development?</h4><p>Customer experience is one of the main aspects, as the world is changing based on customer experience; every single business will need the traditional systems and ERP. As a customer, I want to interact through a cell phone to make a reservation or buy something. The second aspect is big data. With the Internet of Things (IoT), every single device is now connected to the internet and provides information. For example, my phone shows my heart rate, and this is real-time information that is being stored on the cloud. We need to be able to take advantage of that information by analyzing and getting ahead of the competition in terms of understanding patterns of marketing intelligence. The other important thing that Oracle just announced is that we need to have certain intelligence embedded in the systems so that we can do things before we realize they need to get done. </p><h4>What new opportunities did the telecoms reform in Mexico create for Oracle?</h4><p>The reforms were necessary, and one of the main achievements of this administration is the reforms. However, we are facing a problem with the implementation of those reforms. They are intended to produce a better industry with more affordable prices, but the results are yet to be seen because technology is needed to achieve system-wide implementation. Nonetheless, the reforms were important for this industry and are generating a lot of business. The new reforms require companies to use technology in every aspect and require a great deal of IT technology, benefiting the industry.</p><h4>What are your short-term growth projections?</h4><p>I predict the industry to grow between 5% and 8%, and Oracle's growth to continue at its current double-digit rate. Therefore, I am extremely optimistic as we are growing much faster than the industry average. What is driving this growth is the cloud. The public sector is not growing as fast as in previous years because we are in a year of elections. Therefore, most IT investments in the federal government will not grow as fast; although, on the other hand, we will be growing in terms of regulators and reforms. The money spent in IT technology will grow no matter what, with or without the public expenditure, because it enables new business.</p><h4>What are the pillars of your corporate social responsibility strategy?</h4><p>Our purpose is transversal to our business. Around a year and a half ago, we reflected our purpose. We came up with a simple purpose, and that is to transform Mexico by enabling our customers to transform themselves through new technologies. We are focusing not only in growing our business, but also having a social impact. </p>]]></richbody0content>
