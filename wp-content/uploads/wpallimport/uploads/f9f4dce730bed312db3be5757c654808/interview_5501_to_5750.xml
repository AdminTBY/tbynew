		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the key priorities for DMC, DSC, and DPC in the years to come?</h4><p>2017 is an important year for us across Dubai Media City, Dubai Studio City, and Dubai Production City, especially as digitization takes a stronger hold on the media industry. Home to a number of “mobile-first" markets, the MENA region share of views on mobile phones jumped from 11% in 2011 to almost 70% in 2015. This paradigm means that the industry is focused on younger audiences and new platforms for content. So, our main focus will be talent development and content generation. From a content perspective, we are building an online community and providing platforms that enable young talent and professionals to develop advanced digital content. The In5 Innovation Center for media which opens in 1Q2017 will incubate talent and start-ups, providing them with the required support, mentorship, and tools.<br></p><h4>How do you plan to promote innovation as the driving force behind the future growth of these industries?</h4><p>In line with TECOM Group's AED4.5 billion Innovation Strategy to accelerate new start-up development and foster entrepreneurship in the UAE, we are working on making innovation the fabric of the media industry through In5 Innovation Center for media and YouTube projects in Dubai Studio City. In addition, several initiatives will be introduced throughout the year to continuously empower our young talent. In5 will strengthen the entrepreneurial ecosystem of the UAE media industry by supporting freelancers and entrepreneurs in acquiring the right skills through mentorship and providing them with the tools and advanced facilities. Furthermore, Dubai Studio City's recent partnership with YouTube to open the first “YouTube Space" in the MENA region will foster the region's most talented content creators and provide them with free access to high-end audio, visual, and editing equipment, in addition to training programs, workshops, and courses. We are focusing on enabling talents to utilize innovation in generating content that is in line with the consumer behavior and which has changed dramatically due to the digital revolution.</p><h4>According to the Arab Media Outlook 2016, digital is the fastest-growing segment at a CAGR of 14.4% and, within that, gaming holds the most value. What can be done to address the major challenges of lack of talent and start-up funding in the gaming industry?</h4><p>We are living in a young and dynamic region where almost 50 percent of the population is under twenty-four years of age. Complementing this is the fact that all of these people are digital natives — for them technology platforms are a way of life. With the rise in mobile adoption, gaming today has seen a huge shift from traditional consoles. The mass adoption of mobile gadgets means that games are easily accessible, with a range of options available based on devices in use. The MENA region's gaming industry is already worth more than USD1 billion and is expected to grow to USD4.4bn by 2022. This alone presents a significant opportunity for professionals in the gaming industry. With an existing base of script writers, designers, producers, artists, and many more, Dubai is ready to bring together the best creative talent in gaming. However, more awareness needs to be created about professional opportunities for gaming enthusiasts in the region. Across our media communities, we constantly evaluate ways to inspire collaborations and drive entrepreneurial efforts. Through TECOM Group's In5 innovation centers, as well as our business partners, we enable access not just to mentorship and industry best-practices, but also to funding to help great ideas develop into viable businesses. As the gaming industry matures in this region, we see greater potential for young creative talent, which will ultimately lead to the growth of the industry year.</p><h4>The Dubai film industry is seeing outstanding growth, and last year blockbusters such as Star Trek were filmed in the Emirate. What does Dubai Studio City offer to international film production companies?</h4><p>Dubai Studio City is made up of a global business community that has been catering to the production needs of the Middle East for more than a decade. During this time, we have invested in bringing cutting-edge facilities and services to companies from across the globe. We also proved that the city is a media hub through enabling the production of blockbuster movies here. In terms of design, the quality and size of our studios have a good reputation with Hollywood producers as they are built to international standards and capable to take any scale of production, be it film or television. The largest studio, at 50,000 square feet, outstrips many of those found in the biggest and most successful movie production studios in the world. We are also integrating innovation through our In5 innovation centre and the YouTube Space Dubai, which trains and empowers young talent in the industry. The Dubai media industry isn't as mature as other industries, but we are on our way to be one of the leading industries in the world. We have already positioned Dubai as a regional hub through offering international audience and high standards of production. Dubai is also evolving at a rapid rate and is becoming the region's innovation hub. In this regard, HH Sheikh Mohammed announced that 25% of Dubai building will be 3D printed by 2030. We are also heavily investing in Virtual Reality, which attracts international companies to come and utilize this technology in advancing their production techniques.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>We are foreseeing the rise of young talents, and an increase in the number of media start-ups, in addition to more innovative work that will be emerging out of DMC, DSC, and DPC. We are also expecting to see a shift in the content generated here in the UAE, in addition to competing at a global level. Moreover, 2017-18 is set to be an era of many “mobile-first" markets in the MENA region and the stage of content on the small screen. According to the Arab Media Outlook Report 2016-18, this is already evident in the share of views on mobile phones, which jumped from 11% in 2011 to almost 70% in 2015. We also anticipate our community becoming more efficient and innovative, as we are focusing on empowering it through the multitude of initiatives that we are planning to launch this year.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How are the redevelopment projects that you have taken on in Jeddah developing?</h4><p>The mandate of Jeddah Development and Urban Regeneration Company is the improvement of unplanned settlements or slum areas within the city. Jeddah has around 53 million sqm of unplanned settlements. It is a huge city, of more than 1.7 billion sqm, but less than 5% of the city is unplanned settlements. These emerged many years ago when there was no city planning, and some argue that people just wanted a place to live so they created these slum areas. One of our mandates is to develop those areas. One of those areas was Ar-Roweis. It is in the middle of the city in a prime location surrounded by developed areas and close to the waterfront. This project actually started by attracting the private sector to participate in the development. Several development organizations and companies participated. This included some public funds, such as retirement funds, which participated in the forming of this company. This particular area has a large percentage of non-Saudis and almost 87% of the residents are from the Kingdom. Most of them are laborers, and Saudis only represent 14% of the total population. We have worked hard to move residents to another location that is acceptable and an upgrade to their quality of life. The difference is paid from the development fund, and we do not expect them to pay it back; it is to support and encourage them. It took us a while to develop the fund and convince the developers to finance that fund, but we have now reached almost the final stage where we have an approved master plan from the Minister of Municipality &amp; Rural Affairs (MOMRA), and we have developed the detailed infrastructure design. Right now, we are ready to start moving people out and to do that we have to notify all residents about phases of development as we are not doing it all at once.</p><h4>What other projects are you working on at present?</h4><p>We are working on two main projects. We have reached the point where we are now starting actual construction. The first one is the Heart of Jeddah, which is located at the site of the old airport, and stands on an area of around 850,000sqm. We have been working on this project for more than two years and did a complete study and reached the stage now where we have completed the master planning and design of the infrastructure as well as some of the anchor buildings for the project. The project will have some buildings that are unique in Jeddah, mainly the multimodal station, a 175,000sqm facility that will serve as the main metro station in Jeddah with two major metro lines. There will also be a conference and exhibition center, which will be the largest in Jeddah. When finished, the total built up area will be more than 246,000sqm. Just the exhibition area will be 110,000sqm, which is almost the size of Dubai exhibition center. It will have other facilities like a five-star hotel with 44 floors, an auditorium with 2,000 seats, and retail spaces. This reflects the 2030 Vision which envisages a growing tourism sector. We are coupling that with a tourist visa that will encourage those who come to Jeddah for the Hajj to also attend conferences or exhibitions. We see that Jeddah has potential to grow in this area, but right now we do not have sufficient facilities. We have already advertized for both the contractors that are going to build the infrastructure, have opened the bids, and expect to start the final negotiation with the winning contractor shortly.</p><h4>Are you looking for private investors to get involved in that project?</h4><p>JDURC is going to develop all the infrastructure, which includes underground utilities, landscaping, a beautiful lake with fountains, and water canals. Then we have special-purpose vehicles for the conference center, the commercial space, and the business park, as well as opportunities to invest in up to five hotels, a medical center, and other facilities. Then the remaining designated residential developments will be sold to the private sector to build. The other project we are starting is the Murooj development in the east of Jeddah. This is a large site that will be a community by itself of around 130 million sqm. It is well located on the two major highways which connect Jeddah and Makkah, and which pass through our site. It is only 20km away from the airport and 42km away from Makkah. Something interesting is that we are incorporating distinct recreational elements, and are coordinating with the High Commission for Recreation of Saudi Arabia to attract some international visitors to come and develop this recreational area with Saudi firms. In order to start, we did a master plan that was approved by MOMRA and did the detailed design for all infrastructure, including primary and secondary infrastructure. We created an SPV with private developers. Out of the 132 million sqm, there are 22 million sqm that are designated as residential land and which have been transferred to this new SPV. The value of that land is our contribution to the SPV. The private sector are paying around 30% in cash, which is around SAR1.6 billion, and the remaining will be funded through banks and presale, including PIF, which is providing infrastructure finance of SAR6 billion.</p><h4>What do you hope to achieve within the next 12 months?</h4><p>We are working on other areas near the new airport, which is going to be a first-class facility. We have developed a 5 million sqm industrial area and have already opened the first 1 million sqm of that area. There is another project, which we hope to start in 2017, called the Salman Bay development to the North of Jeddah. We are looking at developing the entire area around the waterfront and providing all infrastructure. This is a project we hope to start in this coming year and it will provide a major recreational hub for Jeddah city. We will also work more on parking. This is the work that we hope will come online in 2017, aside from making substantial progress on our ongoing projects.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Malaysia has a traditionally strong agricultural sector, mostly focusing on palm oil, rubber, and cocoa plantations. How can Hungarian technological innovation support these industries to stay relevant in a rapidly changing global environment? </h4><p>Hungary has traditionally been an agricultural country, up until the second half of the 20th Century. Even though new and innovative industries now represent the majority of Hungary's economy, with Budapest amongst the upcoming European capitals for startups, agriculture still has its own traditions in the country, and the government sees it as a strategic sector both for its importance for the domestic economy, and for its potential for foreign trade, and R&amp;D. We face a changing climate for agriculture at the global level both literally and figuratively speaking, so international cooperation should be even more pronounced for agricultural R&amp;D than it is used to be. Hungarian experts have centuries of experience in the agro-scientific field, and we can proudly share our best practices, while also looking for new ideas developed by Malaysia.</p><h4>The Malaysian Agricultural Research and Development Institute (MARDI) focuses maintaining biodiversity and the commercialization of new products. How can Hungarian R&amp;D support organizations such as MARDI?</h4><p>Hungary currently has a central hub for agricultural research, as well as several institutions at universities and other research centers. The National Agricultural Research and Innovation Center (NARIC) as the main hub oversees important RDI capacities. NARIC has huge experience in preserving genetic diversity for agriculture, widening and continuously developing the genetic resources of agricultural production and looking for new utilization possibilities. It has also worked to develop production methods for the effective utilization of genetic potential. NARIC is also involved in fruit and vegetable research, but we also have a successful gene preservation and conservation policy, assisted by the Center for Plant Diversity. Importantly, Hungary has a no-GMO policy, which is guaranteed even at the constitutional level. We believe that the key to safe food supply for future generations are sustainable farming practices in economic, environmental, and social terms. One of the most important elements for achieving this is a consistent policy towards GMOs. The GMO-free status is important for Hungary. Hungarian consumers refuse products containing GMOs, and a higher demand could be expected in the market for GMO-free products. Nevertheless, we perform physiological, genetic, and molecular biology research, and our plant breeding projects have earned us a distinctive position in the global scene, for instance being one of the world's top exporters of cereal seeds. We believe that our long tradition in agriculture research in these fields is a precious resource for furthering work in many Asian research institutes. We can utilize our possibilities through multilateral, EU-based, or bilateral options ranging from exchange programs to shared projects.</p><h4>Can Malaysia function as a gateway to ASEAN for Hungarian firms, exports, and technology transfer?</h4><p>Hungary recognizes the importance of the ASEAN region, including Malaysia. In terms of the so-called Eastward Opening foreign economic policy, Hungary has been making steps to revitalize its connections to business partners outside the EU and the wider European region. We are ready for the next step and would like to promote Malaysia as one of the leading countries of ASEAN where Hungarian firms can find new markets. Of course, this is a mutual opportunity. I underline the fact that Hungary is a member of the EU, one of the most significant integrated markets on the globe. The EU is an attractive market with which to do business. We have 500 million consumers looking for quality goods, and Hungary is located at the heart of Europe. Naturally, our geography is insufficient on its own, which is the reason the government supports investment projects in Hungary by providing a stable business environment and incentives for major investments. Hungary is well-known for its innovation culture as it ranked 33rd on the Global Innovation Index in 2016, which is an outstanding result taking into consideration its geographical location and its few available resources. In this context, we are ready to export our know-how wherever it is in demand.</p><h4>In which sectors of the economy do you envision further growth for Hungarian-Malaysian economic relations?</h4><p>There is definite potential for premium agricultural and food products. Premium quality Hungarian food, and 'Hungarikums,' products unique to Hungary and Hungarians, featured prominently during the series of events organized by our embassy in Kuala Lumpur. Since Malaysia also has unique products unknown or not widely available in Hungary, there is possibility for growth either through direct trade or through getting to know our respective cuisines. Beyond the agriculture and food sector, there is potential for the ICT sector and for pharmaceuticals and health products, as well as for green and sustainable technologies. Naturally, there is strong potential for tourism as well. Many Hungarians visit Malaysia, and I hope that Hungary's touristic potential is to be discovered by Malaysians as well.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Sturgeon was one of the first funds to enter the Iranian market. How was the process of due diligence in establishing the fund?</h4><p>We have been investing in the region for more than 10 years and started coming to Iran in 2011. Following President Rouhani's election we saw that the country was opening up, so we started working on a fund, hiring the best and most expensive law firms in London to make sure everything was good and that the fund was fully sanction-compliant. We ended up launching the fund two months before the lifting of sanctions on December 1, 2015. For the first two months we were in beta mode, wiring money in, buying and selling stocks, and then wiring money out with internal capital to make sure all the plumbing and structure worked to see if we could get money in and money out without any problems. We found that we could indeed do that. A year before launching the fund, we started the due diligence process, and a key issue was service providers. Many were skeptical about dealing with Iran because of sanctions. This was after the deal was agreed but before the implementation date. During that time we were ready to invest but the fund was constantly being delayed. We went through the 550+ stocks of both exchanges, looking at the key stakeholders, looking at the management to make sure they were not sanctioned companies, and looking at shareholders as well, going five layers if necessary up to see who controls each company. Out of 550 stocks, we ended up with 50 stocks that we thought were investable. We started investing in those. Then in mid-January it was the implementation date, and so from 50 stocks we went to 550 stocks, although there are still four or five stocks that we cannot touch. Our investable universe is 550, and we have about 20 positions.</p><h4>How would you rate the standard of financial reporting, regulations, and infrastructure in Iran?</h4><p>I would rate it seven to eight. We have been dealing with other frontier markets in Central Asia, and we have experience in these markets. The stock market infrastructure in Iran is well developed. The traders, brokers, stock exchange, and central custodian are all well developed. Certain service providers, like Bloomberg, do not cover Iranian stocks, but there is a local Iranian Bloomberg, which is extremely good, called Pouya Finance. It is a subsidiary of Mofid, the largest full service broker in the country, who also are our local investment advisor. The local stock market infrastructure is good, but the problem is that it is not connected to the outside world. When sending money abroad, it is complicated. Normally when trading a stock, it is bought via the broker, and then the stock goes to an account in a custody bank. That custody bank does not have a relationship with the local custodian. It is not bad per se, but not being connected means big investors will not invest in a country where the global custodian doesn't have a deal with the local custodian. Regarding transparency, the stock market is transparent in terms of quarterly guidance, which is very detailed. They have to provide quarterly guidance by law, and if they do not respect that guidance by a difference of more than 15%, they have to explain why. So it is a very detailed guidance system. Most recently, the local regulator has mandated that all listed financial companies and companies with a market cap above USD200 million, to amend their financial statements to be in line with IFRS standards. On the other hand, however, investor relations are not developed, so it is tough to get meetings with companies. Saying we are investors is not enough to get a meeting, so we have to do it through our network or tell them we can help them with getting cheaper finance from abroad, or help them get access to some of the Caspian countries. We have to be creative.</p><h4>What are the main opportunities and risks that investors need to be aware of before entering the Iranian stock market?</h4><p>The risks are that we are seeing that people are obsessed by politics and the very negative image that Iran has abroad, and it is difficult to go beyond prejudice. Image and perception are certainly a challenge for Iran. But the West is working more closely with Iran, and more people are going to Iran with more Iranians also traveling abroad. That is the most important thing—people seeing for themselves what Iran is like on the ground. That will help deal with the misconceptions that predominate worldwide. In general, investors perceive political risk to be overvalued. Some forget that Iran is made up of individuals, like any other country, and every company is managed by people, and every company is different. You have to analyze them, the management, their clients, markets, suppliers, how they work, and who they are. You have to go company by company and do your homework. There are good companies and bad companies like anywhere else. As it relates to the opportunity set in Iran, relative to many parts of the world, from an investing standpoint, it demonstrates characteristics that set it apart. Places like Japan and Europe are suffering from terrible demographics, Iran has 65% of its population under 35. Today there is nearly USD13 trillion in negative yielding debt. Iran has 13% real interest rates. Most of the world is set for what will eventually be a rising interest rate cycle, Iran is seeing interest rates fall from the mid-20s to the single digits. And finally, whilst many countries struggle for economic growth, Iran is coming out of a recession where for 2017 it is set to grow 6.6% as forecasted by the IMF. Within the scope of this, given foreign portfolio investment is still only 10bps of the stock markets market cap, there are many areas investors can find opportunities. The Price/Earnings is around six and average dividend yields in excess of 14%.</p><h4>How does Iran factor into Sturgeon Capital's broader agenda of investing in private equity, liquid equity, and fixed income across the New Silk Road?</h4><p>The general view is to cover the Silk Road, and within that to offer investors the opportunity to invest as they please in Silk Road countries, whether its private equity, stocks, investing in oil, whatever. The vision is to give investors access to remote markets that have been otherwise difficult to access, to give them ease of access, work thoroughly on research and due diligence, while being based in London but also having local presence and bases. That is our vision. This region has been key for thousands of years, and I have no doubt it will become the center of the world once again.</p><h4>What's your outlook for the Iranian economy in 2017? Do you see a potential snap-back effect of a Trump administration re-imposing sanctions on Iran?</h4><p>First of all, the JCPOA is an international agreement with signatories including Iran, the US, UK, Germany, and France. The sanctions are a modern version of an embargo. Embargoes work if everyone implements it. If Europe doesn't implement the embargo, then the embargo does not work, because Iran will do business with Europe instead of the US. So the US situation today is a self-imposed embargo, except in the financial sector, where because the dollar is a reserve currency, you can essentially implement sanctions globally. But in trade, you are basically cutting yourself off from trade relating to Iran. Of course, an American foreign subsidiary can trade with Iran as long as American officers are not involved, so it is more complicated than the way I am putting it. But from a rational standpoint, if I was an American company, I would be jealous that Europe is doing business with Iran and they cannot. So I think American businesses will start lobbying the US government to do business with Iran. Trump talks tough on foreign policy, but he is also a pragmatic businessman. So let's see which of the two prevails.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has your business advanced in recent years, especially in light of the recent listing?</h4><p>We started operations in 1996 as a manufacturer and trader of medical and healthcare beds, peripherals, and accessories, and our business operations and customer portfolio have seen a significant expansion over time. Between 2002 and 2008 we were exporting to 10 countries, while today we deliver our products to numerous public and private hospitals and medical centers as well as other healthcare-related facilities in Malaysia and in more than 30 countries across six continents. We have four objectives for our listing: to increase our local and global presence, recruit skilled employees as this will add more value to the company, invest in new machinery to increase our production efficiency, and repay one of our existing bank loans.</p><h4>What international markets do you target? </h4><p>Africa is one of the markets that we target as we already have some presence there. We are also targeting the ASEAN region. We currently sell to over 30 countries, or roughly 16% of all countries. There are still many markets for us to tap into, good opportunities for our product line that can serve any healthcare sector in the world. Through the listing process, we can brand our company internationally and tap into new markets.</p><h4>How would you break down your current revenue and key markets?</h4><p>The key market is still Malaysia, accounting for approximately 80% of our total revenue. Our market share in Malaysia is 40.5% in year 2014 and we are one of the major local player. As of 3Q2016, our export markets are Asia (excluding Malaysia) with 14.68% and the Middle East with 2.13% of the total. These are followed by Africa at 3.79%, Central America at 0.17%, and Europe at 0.01%. In most markets, we have distributors and agents that help us with servicing and promotion.</p><h4>Can you tell us a bit more about your products?</h4><p>Our core business is the manufacturing of medical and hospital beds, including manual, hydraulic, and electric beds. We also produce medical peripherals and accessories such as medical carts, instrument trolleys, and patient transport trolleys. Our production facilities are all in Kuala Lumpur, and we intend to keep on producing there. Perhaps if we find a place where we can set up a second supply chain to expand our operations in another country, we might do so. We currently have our manufacturing, fabrication, and warehousing on the same premises, this saves us a great deal on logistics. We even source most of our raw materials locally except for electrical components and hydraulic system which are from overseas such as Germany, Denmark, and China.</p><h4>What are some of the services provided by your in-house R&amp;D center?</h4><p>We have close relations with our clients and listen to their feedback on our products and how we can improve them. Our R&amp;D is based on market trends and demand as well as customer feedback. Other input comes from exhibitions or interesting designs by other players in the market. We do not copy designs and instead take inspiration to improve our own production line. Another service that our R&amp;D team offers is customizing products according to the needs of our clients. Our industry is increasingly becoming demanding, and we are always on the lookout to improve the safety and comfort of patients. </p><h4>Do you see a great deal of growth coming from the medical tourism industry in Malaysia?</h4><p>The government of Malaysia has launched various national plans and programs to support the growth of healthcare services. The national initiative implemented by the government supports the development of the healthcare industry from the provision of medicines to the construction of healthcare facilities. Our group is poised to increase its presence in the local medical beds industry as well as future opportunities in the export market.</p><h4>The government has identified medical equipment as a key area for growth. Have you seen an increased effort to push the industry forward?</h4><p>The government supports us by inviting us overseas on trade missions where we promote our products. We have often done this by ourselves, and that works well, but the government's presence helps us open doors that would have remained closed otherwise. Under the Eleventh Malaysia Plan, the government announced that it wants to increase access to public medical healthcare. We see our growth in those terms: a need to expand public hospitals leads to higher medical furniture and equipment requirements. We are the one of the largest manufacturers in the nation in terms of revenue in our segment, and we see our domestic market share expanding to meet the growing needs of these new public hospitals and medical centers.</p><h4>What are your key objectives for the year ahead?</h4><p>We would like to acquire new CNC machinery, which allows for high-speed precision cutting, shearing, and punching. These machines will increase our productivity by approximately 30%. Another plan is to amalgamate the two pieces of our existing properties that are currently separated by an empty lot. We would like to utilize this space and include it in the production process, reducing costs and making our operations more lean and efficient. The listing has been fruitful for all the stakeholders involved. Our share price is stable. The issue price upon listing was at RM0.20 and closed at RM0.28. We are in the right industry for the current state of the economy and were one of the top 10 listed companies in terms of share trading volume during our listing day.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[stay-a-little-longer]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main highlights of Air Astana's recent successes?</h4><p>We began as a start-up company. When I arrived 11 years ago, a lot of great of work had been done to get the airline going and it was operating effectively. Over the past four years, however, we have really broken through in terms of service levels, operational reliability, and, of course, our international image. To do so, an airline needs to have a certain number of aircraft, routes, and people who understand what it seeks to achieve internally in terms of corporate and organizational behavior. It is only able to achieve this when it has reached a certain critical mass; that is when it can really develop its internal culture and external image, which is what we have achieved in the last four years.</p><h4>To what extent is the country's size a challenge in Kazakhstan's aviation sector?</h4><p>When measured by industry metrics, we are in fact a low-cost airline; however, we have a huge advantage. We are not only low-cost and highly efficient but we are full-frills: we offer everything at excellent standard on board. Our business class is highly rated, and we have flat or nearly flat seats, top quality in-flight entertainment, food and beverage, lounges, and so on. We are therefore a low-cost airline with a high level of service. The most efficient way to fly is to have one single fleet type. However, we cannot do so because some of our routes are short and require an Embraer, while other routes are long and in high demand, like Bangkok in the winter, for which we have the Boeing 767. Therefore, it is not just the size of the country but the nature of the different markets in which we operate that dictates our need for a multi-aircraft fleet. That obviously means that we cannot operate like Ryanair, for example, which only has 737s, or EasyJet, which only has A320s. Notwithstanding our different market profile, we can still be efficient. This is more complicated but we just have to manage around it. However, Kazakhstan's geographical position is a great advantage for us. People think of Kazakhstan as being in the middle of largely uncharted territory, but it is in fact right at the center of the main east/west trade routes. With the new Airbus 321 NEOs we can fly to any city in China, India, Europe, Russia, the CIS region, Southeast Asia, or Japan. That is a great advantage for us. Our location is absolutely our greatest asset.</p><h4>Can you tell us about Air Astana's expansion plans? </h4><p>We have recently opened a Tehran route, which is only two-and-a-half hours from here. Tokyo is on the list for 2019, as are Singapore, Shanghai, and Chongqing. New York is a distant plan. This year we plan to fly between Astana and Ulan Bator, Kiev, and Delhi, and increase the number of flights on many existing routes, such as London and Beijing. Our fleet will also expand. Since the tenge devalued, foreign travel is obviously more expensive now and thus the number of local travelers has fallen, but this will stabilize. Currently we fly many people from China to London, from Russia to India, and from Ukraine to Thailand. These are just three examples of what we call network business, an increasingly crucial element of our traffic mix. This is the future for us; we cannot rely on traffic to and from Kazakhstan alone as it is both a small and a structurally challenging market, given its huge size and widely-dispersed population centers.</p><h4>Has Air Astana benefited from low oil prices?</h4><p>Oil prices are a double-edged sword; on the one hand, our costs have fallen. However, the market has been very badly affected as the country is dependent on oil for much of its GDP and tax revenues. The overall effect has been that we have lost more than we have gained, though we are still profitable. The years following the 2008 recession were great for us. However, since 2014 when oil prices collapsed and the tenge devalued, it has been challenging. We reached the bottom in 2016. The oil price has partially recovered, but we need to remember that Kazakhstan does not only have oil, it also has huge mineral resources, and as there could well be an infrastructure boom in the US this could a great opportunity. I believe we will come out of the recession of the last two years and get to a good place.</p><h4>Could you tell us more about the one-dollar stopover initiative launched by Air Astana and the potential of Kazakhstan's tourism sector?</h4><p>The initiative has been a great success and we are seeing a huge amount of stopover traffic. Our business to and from Kazakhstan is down by 18%. However, this year our transit business is up 92%. Any tourist who comes to Kazakhstan can stay for a dollar a day. There is revenue for hotels, shopping malls, restaurants, nightclubs, and so on. The average Chinese tourist spends around USD150 a day, not including airfare. Last year, we carried approximately 200,000 Chinese tourists, which is a great deal of money entering the economy. The potential for tourism here is transit business. That is how Southeast Asia—Singapore and Hong Kong in particular—built up their tourism industries, through stopovers. Of course there is potential for traditional tourism—there are people who are interested in winter sports holidays in Kazakhstan, and already flying here with us for this reason—but that is not mass tourism. The greatest potential is in stopovers. When people stop over, they take a short tour, get to know the place, and quickly realize that the country has in fact much to offer.</p><h4>Air Astana is the official carrier of the Expo 2017. How will this affect the company in the medium term? </h4><p>In the medium term the government's plan is to convert the Expo site into a financial center, and if this proceeds as envisioned, we will see a large amount of business traffic. It is a long-term sustainable project. The challenge is to make sure the financial center does in fact come to pass. In the short-term of course we look forward to carrying many visitors to the Expo. It will showcase the best of Kazakhstan and could not come at a better time.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2017? </h4><p>We are cautiously optimistic. We expect an 11% increase in business this year. We have two more Airbuses A320 NEOs on order for delivery mid-year. The government has made significant investments in infrastructure to jumpstart the economy and provide employment. In our case that affords some tremendous benefits. A brand new terminal will open at Astana Airport in mid-May, coincidentally our 15th anniversary. 2017 will be a watershed year and we expect that over the course of the next 15 years, Air Astana will become a widely-known and much respected global brand.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is CONEP's role in promoting the development of the private sector?</h4><p>We are working hard on a lot of policies, and we need to transform our model. We have a lot of sectors that are operating in an old fashioned way, with policies that simply do not meet today's new reality. The world is growing very fast. Every day countries become more connected through commerce and through new, permanent relationships between business communities. That being said, the Dominican Republic has a tradition of isolationism. Throughout most of the second half of the 20th century, the country was completely closed off. This is changing. We have a lot of challenges ahead, particularly with our industrial sector and transportation system. We are now creating a new vision for the Dominican Republic. Last year, CONEP had its national convention, which is the biggest and most important meeting for the private sector in the country. We organize that event every four years and at that congress developed 47 proposals to change the economic, social, and institutional model for the country's development. We prioritized five of those proposals in particular. The first of these five issues involves modifying the labor code. The second touches on structural reform of what is a very complex and costly tax system. The third targets reform of the electricity and power network in the country. There are a lot of challenges there in particular, with constant outages that cost our economy precious time and resources. We need to drastically change the situation there with investment, security, and legal guarantees. The fourth issue that stands out is the transportation system. Right now, there is a virtual monopoly on cargo and passenger transport. The fifth main point is the need for an independent, sensible, and efficient justice system. The whole justice system needs to be made stronger and more independent of political forces. Those are the five most important points, but all 47 points have very specific action plans behind them.</p><h4>Over the past 10 years the Dominican Republic has received USD21 billion in FDI and currently receives 39% of all FDI in the Caribbean. What competitive advantages does the country have in attracting this foreign investment?</h4><p>We have a labor force of 4.9 million people and a market of 10 million consumers. Haiti next door has another 10 million people. We have access to the EU and the US through free trade agreements. We have very good sectoral legislation including free zones and legislation promoting tourism. Most importantly, we have a national private sector that invests in the country. That is a very good sign for foreign investors. When the people of the country trust in their own economy and invest in their own country, it acts as a capital magnet to the world. We also have very good infrastructure, with nine international airports and 15 seaports throughout the island, not to mention stunning beaches and abundant natural beauty. Our people are also very friendly and open to foreigners and foreign investment. After people's very first visit, they want to come back again and again, if only for the people. On top of all that, we've been growing at a rate above 5% for more than 50 years. Also, Dominicans work very hard and have a great entrepreneurial spirit. They take the biggest and most developed countries in the Americas and Europe as their benchmark. That is who they compare themselves to and strive to compete with. That naturally puts a lot of pressure on our shoulders, but we try to achieve those standards. It makes us very ambitious and motivated as a result. To be sure, a large portion of our society remains poor, but poverty has also been gradually reduced over the last 20 years.</p><h4>From CONEP's perspective, what would be the ideal outcome of the Fiscal Pact?</h4><p>We need a new system that is less expensive and less complex, while also being more user-friendly and easier to administrate. Over 95% of companies in the Dominican Republic are MSMEs. In a country with low levels of education, you cannot complicate things with archaic regulations and bureaucracy. We need to simplify things. There are a lot of taxes to keep track of and companies spend a lot of money to find the people, time, and expertise to deal with it all. This has to change.</p><h4>How would ending the longstanding monopolistic practices of the transportation unions affect the operations of private businesses in the country?</h4><p>When you compare the price of transporting cargo in the Dominican Republic, it is almost five times the average cost of Central America. That is all because of the monopolies. They control the ports. You cannot take your cargo from the ports unless you go through them. To give you an example, if you are a company in Santiago that wants to send cargo to the port in Santo Domingo, you have to give your cargo to the union truck in Santiago. But, once that truck gets to Santo Domingo, it cannot take new cargo to bring back to Santiago. You have to pay a second truck for that, which is basically the next truck in line. That makes no economic sense and it makes the process very expensive and inefficient. To give you a comparison, the average truck in Guatemala runs 10,000 miles a year, whereas the average truck in Dominican Republic runs just 2,000 miles. That in itself highlights the problems being faced because of monopolistic practices in the transportation sector and the dire need for reform to allow us to be more competitive and attract more foreign investment. Governments never like to deal with these situations and they fear the power of unions. The same thing happened in the 1950s in the US with Jimmy Hoffa. We are pushing the government to be brave and take the necessary measures to resolve these issues in cargo and public transport once and for all. We have taken the issue to the justice department and we are hoping for measures that will ensure that the sector runs in accordance with the national constitution.</p><h4>Which sectors of the economy currently present the best potential for growth and the most opportunities for investors?</h4><p>The most promising growth sectors of our economy are industrial production, agribusiness, tourism, mining, trade, construction, and telecommunications. Other sectors that have major potential for investors are energy, border development, the Dominican film industry, and technology. Those sectors stand out in the overall economy, and are the most promising in the country today, and will be for years to come.</p><h4>How do you see Dominican exports evolving and diversifying in terms of products and destinations?</h4><p>Export products and markets have been growing rapidly over the past ten years. We have extraordinary potential for more and faster growth. The problem is the lack of strategy, a strategy that merges public and private sector participation. We are now working on that with the government. In the next ten years, I think our situation will change radically. We are open to new countries. We have a commercial relationship with China, while still having a political relationship with Taiwan. I think that it will change soon, and that will bring a boost in bilateral commerce between the two countries. We have a very conscientious political sector that is now becoming more aware of the importance of the private sector and of exports. We have been borrowing a lot of money from the international financial system but are fast approaching our limit regarding that as far a strategy for growth.</p><h4>What factors do you think will boost growth in the coming years?</h4><p>The tourism sector is very important, but we also have a lot of potential to become a regional hub thanks to our ports and airports. If we achieve our goals of bringing a logistics center of international standards to the Dominican Republic and creating a strong international airline, it will give us a great competitive advantage. This year we signed an agreement with the US to have a preclearance system at the Punta Cana airport, a first for any country in Latin America. That will be a major boost to both our tourism sector and our logistics sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the NSE's new e-dividend management system and what does it mean for your future operations?</h4><p>The e-dividend management system facilitates the payment of dividends in an electronic format. Investors can get their dividends faster and hopefully if a lot of people register on the system this will reduce the instances of unclaimed dividends. We believe this is the way to go. We think that deploying technology to help us implement clearly thought out processes is the aim and it positions the NSE as a 21st-century stock market.</p><h4>What is the strategy behind your decision to explore joint opportunities with the London Stock Exchange Group to accelerate dual listings? </h4><p>The London Stock Exchange views itself as an active listing platform for African corporates that are looking to access international funds, as London is an international financial center. At the end of 2015, we started implementing our 2015-19 Strategic Plan and we increased our geographical footprint from Nigeria to Africa in general. We decided we would be a platform not only for the listing of Nigerian corporates, but also for Nigerian corporates operating outside Nigeria around the continent, as well as the many African international corporates operating in Nigeria. In order to do this, we thought it would be beneficial to partner with an exchange that is well known and well regarded as an international listing platform. The Nigeria Stock Exchange is the second largest platform in Africa; therefore, given the linkages that are beginning to emerge on the continent from the African Securities Exchanges Association (ASEA) perspective to the various sub-regional groupings, such as the West African Capital Markets Integration Council, we are positioning ourselves to be a trusted partner to domestic exchanges from an African perspective. We have had some success with this strategy. Seplat Petroleum Plc was the first truly dual listed IPO and it is fungible. In fact, this fungibility has allowed it to weather the forex storm we have seen because people can enter in Lagos and exit in London or vice versa. We have seen liquidity move across both markets based on what is happening in the economies.</p><h4>What role does the NSE play in providing a positive environment for investors and what steps do you take to protect those investors?</h4><p>We play a role that spans the value chain from promoting Nigeria as an investment destination to engaging with portfolio managers to talk about the details of the experience, such as how you actually access the market to deploy financing. The NSE ensures the ease of doing business on our platform and that the experience you get is world-class. We do this by making sure we have strong regulations that create a level playing field and a transparent market. The kind of market where you get financial reports from corporates on time and corporate governance is well implemented and viewed as a competitive tool. We have carried out a number of initiatives in this area to ensure corporates actually live up to their billing because you invest in a company in order to get positive returns. We have introduced a corporate governance rating system, which is now mandatory for companies on the main board. We have come up with various products to give international investors a menu of choices. Today, we offer listing and trading for equities, and we do the same for fixed income and exchange funds. Now we are working on derivatives, which we hope to launch sometime in early 2017. Another thing we do to ensure that foreign portfolio investments have a good experience in Nigeria is we make sure they are able to access their funds when they want to exit and that we understand what their issues are and address those as quickly as possible. If it is a matter beyond our power then we will advocate on investors' behalf. We have been doing this around issues concerning the repatriation of forex for foreign investors.</p><h4>What are the advantages for an indigenous company to list on the NSE?</h4><p>There are many advantages for an indigenous company to list on the NSE, from capital raising through to the less-thought-about advantages such as branding. If you are a bank in Nigeria and you are not listed people will think there is something wrong. We provide a platform for raising capital, but more importantly when you are listed on the NSE you have a credit rating, which allows you to get other types of financing at better rates. You are viewed as being a transparent and compliant entity because of the rigors of listing and your on-going duties to report your financials and so forth. Another good reason for domestic companies to list is that typically the founder of a company wants to pass control from one generation to another. A further reason would be to diversify risk. By having multiple shareholders from different countries with different views, you are able to build a more sustainable company than if you remain the only shareholder. You might also list because you want to affect the company's balance of debt and equity to ensure you have the optimal debt-equity ratio to optimize the valuation of the company. Listing gives you this flexibility and a tool to expand your business. We see a lot of M&amp;A activity that is financed using stock. We are working hard with policymakers in Nigeria to introduce other kinds of benefits, such as tax breaks for listed companies, given that they comply better in paying their taxes than the equivalent private companies. Being a listed company also allows you the flexibility to expand geographically. If you look at some of our listed companies that have been founded by domestic entrepreneurs, they are beginning to become African champions. They are companies that are expanding across Africa. They have been able to do this because of the support and financing they have received through the NSE. There are so many positive reasons to list.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2017?</h4><p>We really must institutionalize the fight against corruption in a way that the bureaucracy supports the ease of doing business. In the short term we have trade imbalance issues, we have strong demand for forex and we are not getting enough of it. We need to address this by increasing the supply of forex through borrowing forex, selling assets, doing swaps, or a combination of all three. For the long term we all know we need to diversify our forex sources. The challenge is that crude oil accounts for about 90% of Nigeria's forex earnings. We have to actively support export-oriented industries.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the most significant changes and projects that have occurred over recent years?</h4><p>When we started in Yanbu 40 years ago, this area was a desert. The city has grown rapidly and continues to expand while providing excellent investment opportunities in numerous industry sectors and became a globally recognized industrial and business center located on the coast of the scenic Red Sea in Saudi Arabia. The Royal Commission at Yanbu has undergone major transformation phases over the past 40 years of its existence, moving from infrastructure development to becoming a comprehensive city management business model focusing on strategic partnerships and promoting industrial development and diversification. The mission of the Royal Commission at Yanbu is to plan, promote, develop, and manage our city. Over the past five years, we have been focusing on developing a specialized industrial city for strategic downstream industries or clusters that complete the Kingdom value chain, increase our finished product export, and create more jobs for Saudi citizens. To enable accelerated growth and make our city very attractive location, our partnership with strategic investors has focused on continuing to build efficient infrastructure that suits all types of industries through the use of integrated sea ports and advanced multi-modal logistics hubs. We are also developing reliable energy and utilities solutions. The interdependence between energy and industrial growth is crucial to sustainable development. We are also making progress with the development of a vibrant city with outstanding lifestyle options to make it conducive to raising a family.</p><h4>Where do your efforts to bolster logistics capabilities stand at present?</h4><p>One of the Saudi Vision 2030 goals is to raise our global ranking in the Logistics Performance Index from 49 to 25 and ensure that the Kingdom becomes a regional leader, leveraging the country's location at the crossroads of important international trade routes between Asia, Europe, and Africa. To achieve this goal, one of the Royal Commission Initiatives in the National Transformation Program 2020 involves the development of a Multi-Modal Logistics Hub in Yanbu Industrial City. The Economic Plan 2030 of Royal Commission at Yanbu defined this initiative in 2012. Since then we have completed the development of Yanbu Master Plan that includes projects such as the MMLH. That project by itself is an important development for the city, with a total area of 75sqkm. RCY has completed the necessary designs and started construction work for this project late 2016. The objective of the MMLH is to provide outstanding logistics services to our investors by means of rail, air, and sea. This will provide world-class customer service through safe, reliable, and efficient logistics services liking our city with others regionally and globally. The project has many components including rail links, warehousing, shared tank farms, a minerals hub, and special economic zones. All these components will help to optimize the supply chain for investors and promote new investment in the Kingdom. To support the planned Yanbu MMLH, Yanbu Industrial College is establishing a national logistics center of excellence to train employees to overcome the technological challenges facing the logistics industry. The Center of Excellence in Logistics will position Yanbu as a hub for industry-driven transport, distribution, and logistics commercialization and help build a national reputation for Yanbu as a location for logistics service providers entering the Kingdom.</p><h4>Do those new refineries include the expansions to Yasref?</h4><p>Yanbu industrial city is the third largest global refining hub in the world and has the largest oil shipping port on the Red Sea. The current refining capacity of the Kingdom is 3.1 million barrels a day, and this will reach 8 million barrels a day within ten years. Yanbu will have a major share of this expansion. By then, Yanbu will be the world's largest refining hub. The Royal Commission's long-term vision for economic development and diversification will position Yanbu industrial city beyond exporting basic chemicals and intermediates and allow it to produce more value-added downstream petrochemical derivatives and converted finished goods. The expansion of Yasref will definitely support our long term diversification strategy.</p><h4>The downstream segment is a key focus of the National Transformation Plan (NTP). How are you supporting these broader goals?</h4><p>Hydrocarbon industries including refining and petrochemicals will continue to be at the heart of our industrial base. However, since 2010, the Royal Commission has begun a new wave of development which focuses on the downstream segment. Our industries include six clusters that we have developed. We have solar and renewable energy clusters as well as a construction materials cluster. We also have different clusters related to plastics and specialty chemicals, minerals, automotive support, and spare parts for desalination and primary industries. The Royal Commission at Yanbu already has industries in each cluster and at different stages, whether in operation or construction and design. It is worth mentioning that the Royal Commission at Yanbu initiative to build a spare parts cluster will supply the spare parts required locally for the construction of the desalination plants. We have been achieving great figures for the past six years including 2016. We almost tripled our downstream activities compared with the previous 20 years. We were able to expand our Light Industrial Park (LIP) area for downstream activities by three times in order to accommodate these new industries. These industries need a different kind of support from that of basic industries as they are almost always smaller companies and smaller entities. We help them in many ways, including by providing prefabricated manufacturing buildings. All they need to do is to plug in their equipment and start production. Moving toward downstream industry will diversify Yanbu's product portfolios by producing a wider range of products, generating more employment opportunities, and opening up new opportunities for the Kingdom's petrochemical industry.</p><h4>What are your ambitions for the year ahead?</h4><p>I can assure you that we will have huge projects in the coming years worth over SAR10 billion and involving various sectors. In industrial areas, we will have important projects that we are working on already. Part of the development will be for our colleges and institutes in Yanbu. Projects related to the development of community services like hotels and complexes of houses and recreational facilities are all part of the overall plan. Projects focused on industry and housing will represent the bulk of our work next year. We will also launch our Smart City initiative, which is a project that we started three years ago. Now we have a base for launching it. Soon we will have a major celebration for the first Saudi Arabian city to become a smart city. It will also become one of the world's first industrial cities to do so. Completing these projects, providing customer-focused services programs and close partnerships with stakeholders will allow us to achieve our goals and move closer to accomplishing the Saudi Vision 2030.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In light of the upcoming 10th anniversary of Khalifa Fund, what is your assessment of the institution's role in financing SMEs and startups and what setbacks has the institution overcome along the way?</h4><p>Since its inception, Khalifa Fund has worked on two main pillars. Those were primarily on fostering entrepreneurship among the country's population and direct financing of small business, particularly startups. I would say the first few years were challenging from the perspective of managing expectations. Entrepreneurship should be perceived as a viable career opportunity, instead of the typical search for a public sector job. We embarked on a series of strategic initiatives that engage with the communities and institutions that have outreach programs. Furthermore, we conducted hundreds of awareness campaign programs and activities through academia and NGOs, in order to encourage the young population to explore the opportunities provided by entrepreneurial activity. On the small business financing side of our mandate, we started with one financial product and gradually created more products that fit the different demographics of the applicants that came through our door. With that we started to see a surge of interest, moving from an average of about 50 applications to over 300 per month. I would also attribute that notion to the fact that in 2009 our mandate was expanded to cover the whole of the UAE and that brought more interested parties forward. Of course we cannot forget the period of time when the Global Economy went through some turmoil and much of the region was affected by it. Needless to say that SMEs were faced with similar challenges especially due to the fact that the service sector was one of the areas most affected in this region. However, over the past several years we at Khalifa Fund have been able to devise a mechanism through which we can closely monitor the different economic sectors within the UAE, and accordingly come up with targeted policies to support SME growth or limit them for a period of time.</p><h4>What has been Khalifa Fund's strategy for effectively allocating available resources and encouraging other entities to expand their funding and mentoring capabilities?</h4><p>I would like to start by thanking all those institutions, domestic and international, who recognize that SME growth is very much the backbone of robust economic growth and even more in the UAE. Accordingly the fact that they have participated in that strategy directly was very influential for keeping communities interested in this area. Furthermore, the recent introduction to the definition of SMEs paves the way for organizations such as Khalifa Fund to have more constructive dialog with financial institutions and to increase their financial and technical participation in SME growth across the country. We have also been privileged to work with several NGOs to mentor would-be entrepreneurs on the main traits of enterprise creation and overcoming some of the stigma that is affiliated with that motivational drive. One of our most recent achievements was working with the Ministry of Social Affairs to establish the first association that represents SMEs. This gives the entrepreneurs a voice and lobbies entrepreneurial interests before governmental institutions and ministries. We have also noted the need for an angel investor network across the Gulf region and have identified a number of individuals that could get involved as financiers and mentors for distinguished Emiratis.</p><h4>How will the recent move from the Ministry of Education to include innovation in its parameters encourage educative centers to develop the entrepreneurial ecosystem in the UAE?</h4><p>I believe that it will enhance the Ecosystem within the UAE. We at Khalifa Fund believe that innovation takes different shapes when it comes to surviving in a competitive economy, especially when you have new business coming from regional and international destinations. Without that crucial parameter young business will tend to struggle and at times fail. At times we at the fund have seen several business owners completely change their business model/operations and try to innovate so as to be able to grow that business and address new opportunities.</p><h4>What are the main constraints in fostering entrepreneurial mindsets among young Emiratis and how can these effects be reversed?</h4><p>The first step to tackle that is at a grassroots level. Young people in primary and secondary schools need to be exposed to these ideas, and be encouraged to possibly become entrepreneurs in their own respect. We also acknowledge that gaining experience in the “world of work" builds character for those UAE graduates and we welcome a period of time where they gain work experience. I have personally worked with the European Union Commissioner Office to create ties with other international institutions who are willing to provide some level of skills development for business owner startups. That is still in the works. We continue to address the stigma linked to self-employment and which needs to be addressed if we want to see a new generation of entrepreneurs. There continues to be a lot of work done by schools, universities, and governmental agencies to change this perspective and that is why we have always said that this will be a collaborative effort for all related parties.</p><h4>What are the key assets an SME has to have to be successful in this market? </h4><p>Entrepreneurs are unlike any other professionals. This whole notion of embracing failure, taking on new challenges, and being receptive to the idea that others can facilitate your business opportunities exist around the world, and we are working hard to bring those ideas and general culture to our society. Let us not forget that global indicators for small business startups can reach up to a 78% failure rate. Unfortunately, these figures deter people in our society from venturing into entrepreneurial initiatives and this is the type of mentality we are trying to change. However, on the other side of the spectrum, venture capitalists are always on the lookout for those who have faced multiple sets of challenges in starting a business simply because that is a good indicator of one's hunger to succeed. Entrepreneurs need to address ongoing challenges head on before they can rise to the top. It is honestly a cultural challenge, whereby culture has to acknowledge that failure is always a good indication of how much determination an individual or group of people can or should have to succeed in a constantly-changing economic landscape.</p><h4>Which sectors of the economy hold the greatest potential for the next generation of SMEs and startups?</h4><p>SMEs are the main pillar of every sector, from hydrocarbons to tourism, and from F&amp;B to ICT. Given the current financial restraints in the market, there are some sectors that cannot build momentum for the development of SMEs, such as manufacturing industries for small business. Tourism remains the leading sector for SME activity, with social media following closely as it develops rapidly in the Arab world. Of course F&amp;B remains the bread and butter for SMEs and startups to open niche markets and expand to foreign markets. It is refreshing to see wave after wave of young, ambitious entrepreneurs coming into the market regardless of the industry they operate in.</p><h4>How has Khalifa Fund contributed to building the brand of Emirati SMEs around the world?</h4><p>We have seen a good number of Emirati SMEs successfully expanding their horizons to regional and global markets, even competing with well-established international brands. Part of our job is to connect our entrepreneur talent pool, with the recognized names and private institutions out there that are eager to work with this new breed of talents. We as Khalifa Fund have an obligation to engage with the wider demographics of society here in the UAE, and I can safely say that through our leadership from HH Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed, the president as well as his brothers have been very satisfied with how this organization has engaged with society in creating an entrepreneurial environment. This confidence from our leadership has involved us in international SME development activities as part of the UAE's geopolitical agenda. We were one of the first governmental institutions to participate in economic development in the Republic of Egypt. We work with well-established SME development institutions on the ground in all 27 provinces to support small and home-based business with a focus on micro financing for the youth and female populations. Furthermore, we have started to mobilize our teams into working on establishing an SME Agency in the Republic of Chechnya (again as part of that leadership agenda), and we are working with the Russian Federation Institution who have a vested interest in seeing ongoing economic growth in the CIS. The objective from our leadership is that we as Khalifa Fund have built a wealth of knowledge and know-how in this area, and we are now transferring that knowledge and providing capacity building for entrepreneurs in different countries. Going forward the notion is to move away from the traditional patriarchal ways of donating money and aid. Finally, I would like to highlight that through the vision of our Chairman HE Hussain Al Nowais and the Board of Directors we have built and begun implementing sustainable operating models that I believe we can replicate with our partners going forward. We hope to share more on that next year.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Movistar has already reached 2 million users in Costa Rica and has 25% of the market. What strategy did the company implement to achieve this?</h4><p>Telefonica Costa Rica started operations in 2011 and has created a robust company in only five years that has enabled us to reach 2 million users. New technologies and innovation have been the main drivers of our development in the country. In this context, we have based our operations on three pillars: customer service and the digitalization and simplification of their experience; 3G coverage for 95% of the population and 4G coverage for 70% of the population; and innovation—our Movistar company is focused on developing the most innovative products and services. In addition, our company has taken on an active role when it comes to sponsoring sports events and two key players for the national team, Bryan Ruiz and Keylor Navas. This sponsorship has helped us gain proximity to our users, and we feel extremely proud of being able to support these national heroes.</p><h4>What is the importance of Costa Rica for the company's global and regional operations?</h4><p>We are the youngest companies in the group and Costa Rica. We have invested more than USD500 million in infrastructure and platforms. Penetration levels of technology products are very dynamic and offer great potential, making this market an attractive one for companies such as ours. Costa Rica represents a long-term investment for the company.</p><h4>What can you tell us about the main products set to be launched in 2017 such as Movistar Play or the Digital Wallet?</h4><p>We have a strong focus on data, and since we have been innovating since day one, we continuously launch new products and services into the Costa Rican market. In terms of products, we are currently looking into launching Movistar Play, Napster, and Fila Cero. In the future, we will be moving into financial services. However, in Costa Rica we see great potential in SMEs, and for this we have launched products such as SME in a Box and Negocio Smart. For example, according to the Ministry of Economy, 93.4% of the economic contribution of industries comes from SMEs. In our B2B business line, we develop personalized services and products for these companies—micro, small, and medium-enterprises. We try to adapt our services to their budgets and enable them to grow from a technological point of view. We also think this is an interesting sector in which to grow our data center's activity. Around 93% of our customers are private users and the remaining 7% are companies, including B2B.</p><h4>Costa Rica's 3G speed is lower than the world average and its 4G is five times lower. Among the three operators, Movistar has the highest speed and coverage. What further investments plan to you have to increase coverage of your 3G and 4G services?</h4><p>We reach remote areas of the country in the following two ways. We have coverage agreements within the country that were implemented as soon as those agreements were signed, as well as investments to close the digital gap within the population. Both strategies, but above all the latter, help us reach remote areas of the country. We bring technology to those areas as well as access. For example, Telefonica Foundation takes an active role in this context, and we have gained three projects in the country. One of them has to do with technological training for teachers and students in remote areas of the country. One of the main challenges the industry faces is the tendering of new frequencies expand coverage, for the market is quite saturated. We also need more spectrums to continue investing in innovation in this area.</p><h4>What are the main challenges of operating in Costa Rica for a company like Telefonica?</h4><p>This is an interesting market that can serve as testing arena for many multinationals. However, one of the main challenges are the current regulations. In this our efforts have been massive but progress scant. Telefonica has contributed in an important way to the development of the mobile and technological market here in Costa Rica, and this has made us the industry leader. We are a reference in the sector, and innovation has enabled us to become pioneers in many areas. For example, we were the first company to invest in an enterprise incubator in Costa Rica and the region. This project is called Open Future, and we will soon complete the third call for start-up projects. We have also signed an agreement with a couple of municipalities like Heredia and Cartago to transform them into so-called smart cities. These kinds of projects are important in setting us apart from the competition. In this context, innovation also sets us apart, and our leading role in Central America is a major point of attraction for corporate customers.</p><h4>What are your main goals and objectives for 2017?</h4><p>Our main objective is to continue serving our 2 million users. We actually have loyalty user plans, where we know the user's entire journey. We want to continue innovating our services and products for the public and private sector, the former having great potential. We plan to continue expanding our data centers and the data sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were some of the notable events and initiatives that took place with the British Chamber of Commerce Qatar (BCCQ) over the past year?</h4><p>It has been a busy year. One key feature is that there is a continuing strong interest in doing business in this market. We have had just over 400 companies express an interest in doing business here. The Chamber met with each and in most cases we were able to offer some real help. Most recently we supported the British Embassy hosting a Sports Trade Mission focused on the business of sport. The FIFA World Cup is clearly important for Qatar, but so too are a number of other top sporting events. We were pleased to support the Embassy and also the Supreme Council for Delivery and Legacy as their engagement made it a much more meaningful mission for those UK businesses that attended. Earlier in the year, we also hosted a delegation from the Royal Institute of British Architects. We focused on the theme of green construction as we feel it is an area where British architects have genuine expertise and we want to promote that message. The Royal Institute of British Architects is the blue-ribbon organization representing the UK's architectural industry and the visit was very successful.</p><h4>What are some of the details behind the MoU signed between the BCCQ and the Supreme Committee for Delivering Legacy?</h4><p>This particular MoU is largely designed to support community engagement. The Qatar authorities want to ensure that the 2022 FIFA World Cup really touches and connects with every part of Qatar society, including both local nationals and the diverse expatriate population. Our MoU is one of a number that the Supreme Committee has agreed with community groups and organizations to ensure that it is reaching out to all parts of society. From our side we are keen to engage with the Supreme Council to strengthen business engagement and to support the development of the private sector and the economy beyond 2022.</p><h4>Do the BCCQ's main World Cup initiatives relate to community engagement?</h4><p>We support community engagement particularly because we think it is important that there is a business perspective. We are keen to ensure that the business community can participate and contribute, not just in terms of gaining new business. It is also about supporting the delivery of an iconic moment for Qatar and we think businesses here can benefit from being associated with this major event, even if there is no direct commercial involvement. The private sector is an important part of the fabric of Qatar and private-sector companies can play a key role in building a better society and future for this country.</p><h4>Business engagement is another focus for the Chamber. What are some of the value additions of becoming a member of the BCCQ?</h4><p>The key for us is to try and ensure that we support good businesses and encourage them to take a longer-term view. Rightly or wrongly there has been a perception in the past that some foreign businesses look at countries like Qatar only in a one off transactional way. I believe the Qatar government wants to see people making a longer-term investment in the future of the country. We want to engage business to see that the benefits are better over the longer term through repeat business and showing you are a responsible member of society here.</p><h4>How can the BCCQ assist Qatari firms to navigate the business world in the UK?</h4><p>One of our ambitions is to be very much a bilateral Chamber. This is about supporting both British and Qatari business. We have had stronger interest from UK companies looking to take on the Qatar market than the other way round. Qatari companies tend to favor doing business regionally. We would like to help break that mold and genuinely support a more international approach. We are for example seeing some strong trends. Qatari investors are looking to the UK for investment in real estate. I am keen to encourage them to look into other investment activities such as equities, investment in R&amp;D, or simply setting up in business and operating independently. The BCCQ can help here by introducing Qatari companies that are buying UK products and services to the same UK companies that are supplying them. One idea that could be particularly helpful is to take them to the UK to meet a range of suppliers across an industry. By broadening their range of contacts and connections, we can help Qatari businesses form partnerships and joint ventures that allow them to reach new markets that they might not otherwise access.</p><h4>Are you looking to develop more links with local firms?</h4><p>Yes, we are very much looking to do this. We have several local firms that are already members of BCCQ, so it is not just a British-based membership. Qatar's ambitions are great, and BCCQ is a fan of supporting those ambitions and helping develop the private sector here. The challenge is how best to achieve those ambitions. We want to play a role in developing corporate ambitions into clear business plans and helping to execute them. We certainly try to do that with companies from the UK that come here, and we would like to do it more for Qatari companies going in the other direction.</p><h4>What are some of the challenges that British companies face when they try to penetrate the Qatari market?</h4><p>Culture is clearly a big hurdle. Another factor is adjusting to a market place where things take a lot longer to get done. Qataris are patient and want to reflect on business proposals before proceeding. This is also quite a small country so it falls to a smaller group of people to manage the country's growth. It is quite right for them to take their time and ensure that whatever deal is on the table is the right one for them. British companies often tell us they are impatient about not getting a quick answer, for example to a tender bid. We tell people that patience is a key virtue here. Issues like payment terms are a real factor for British SMEs that find it difficult to manage long payment terms because cash flow is so critical to them. We encourage people to think about how they can structure their payments and manage the cash flow challenge better. We are also very strong advocates of taking out export credit insurance. Indeed we would like to encourage Qatar to look into providing their own export credit insurance. A Qatari export credit bank would be a fantastic addition to the range of financial solutions needed to support SMEs.</p><h4>What is your vision for the BCCQ over the next 12 months?</h4><p>For the BCCQ, I would like to think we will see steady growth. A gradual rise in oil prices would be preferable to a boom and bust cycle, which is what usually gets business into difficulty. We would rather have steady and stable growth over a longer term. My ambition is for the Chamber to expand beyond the range of sectors we have been active in so far. I would like BCCQ to be seen as a much more reliable partner on the British side in terms of doing business and would also like to see us grow much more in terms of supporting Qatari businesses in other countries and markets.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the enthusiasm for Expo from people both locally and abroad, in particular for the future energy theme?</h4><p>When we were trying to attract countries, for example certain countries in Africa, some of them did not know where Kazakhstan was located, though they knew our president Nursultan Nazarbayev, which was interesting. The theme of future energy was popular and many developed countries are now putting forward their programs to switch to green economy and concepts to increase the share of renewable and alternative energy in their total consumption. Developing countries are also working in this direction; however, there are some countries where some villages have no electricity or perhaps do not have a television or refrigerator. Arab countries such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE are now also significantly investing in solar power and are working in this direction.</p><h4>What differences do you see in terms of the interest from developing countries versus developed ones?</h4><p>The technology in green energy is currently quite expensive and if we are to develop these technologies in developing countries we should have the assistance of such organizations as the World Bank. Many other financial institutions are now investing in developing countries and technologies are being developed every day so prices are falling. We visited an island in the Maldives that is fully powered by solar power; it took a loan from the World Bank and built all the facilities on the island. We conducted excursions there; it even uses waste to generate power. We invited it to showcase all this technology to other countries. We also visited the Vatican, which will participate in Expo 2017—100% of the energy needs of the Vatican is supplied through solar panels.</p><h4>How will Expo change the global reputation of Kazakhstan as a green energy country?</h4><p>Kazakhstan has initiatives to transition to green technologies and green economies that were initiated by our president during the UN summit in South Africa. We initiated this concept on transitioning to green energy and the Green Bridge program, and many countries subsequently joined this initiative. We also want to develop innovations and technologies in Kazakhstan; the Ministry of Energy has announced a competition of start-ups in this field. A total of 1,000 companies, including 100 Kazakhstani companies and many others from overseas, will participate. We also have a pavilion called Best Practices that will include projects developed in different countries, including companies from Silicon Valley. We are tasked by President Nazarbayev to establish a center of green technologies and investment projects under the UN agencies and after Expo this center will be located in the Kazakhstan pavilion . It will deal with the new technologies in this field of green economy and green technologies and also attract investments in this direction. Even now we have made great progress and have set up solar panels and wind turbines in different regions and in the future plan to use safe nuclear power stations. This will give an impetus to Kazakhstan and the entire Central Asia region.</p><h4>What will eventually happen to the iconic building that is being used for Expo 2017?</h4><p>When we were planning the construction of the facilities we attempted to meet all the requirements of green technology for the buildings. We have solar panels and the turbine in this pavilion and also met all the requirements to use local construction materials. Expo will give us the chance to attract new technologies. The decision to establish the Astana International Financial Center based on the premises of Expo 2017 is also great because it helps to attract investment and make Astana the financial hub of Central Asia. We learnt a great deal from the experience of Dubai; before the Dubai Financial Center was established we saw that growth was 5 or 6% a year but after the center was established, growth was 12% a year. We view this as a striking example and a great experience for us to use.</p><h4>What is your vision on the long-term impact Expo will have on making Kazakhstan a tourist destination and on the overall economy?</h4><p>Expo is a locomotive for many sectors, including tourism; in addition, we will use new materials, standards, and technologies and this will develop our logistics and transport. We are currently constructing a new terminal at the airport as well as a new railway station; we have also launched an LRT, which is a new mode of transport in our country. All these initiatives will create new jobs. When the AIFC is established, all the high-end restaurants operating during Expo 2017 will be in the financial center. The pavilion will also include a museum of future energy that will cooperate with another university and thus develop the economy, science, and technologies. All these will make the AIFC a center of green technologies and investment projects and attract tourists. For Expo we expect 2 million tourists and about 5 million visits in total. About 85% of the visitors will be from Kazakhstan and 15% will be foreign visitors, mainly from neighboring countries such as Russia, China, and Central Asian countries. We are also working to relax our visa regime. Last year we introduced a visa-free regime for 20 developed countries for up to 15 days. From January 2017 there will be a visa-free regime for all OECD countries plus the UAE, Monaco, Lithuania, Latvia, Romania, and Bulgaria—approximately 40 countries—for up to 30 days. We are not only working to open our doors to foreign countries and subsequently for them to facilitate a visa free regime for our citizens, we are also launching new air flights and increasing the frequency of flights between our countries.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What spurred the creation of OPTIC in 2004, and what was your role in the development of IT policy in the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>OPTIC was created in September of 2004 when the government decided that a more concentrated effort was needed to direct the nation's communications and information technology. Its goal is to regulate telecoms and guarantee the development of information technologies. We use the UN's framework as a reference. One of the UN's main surveys was an e-government study conducted in 2016 that provides data that allows us to construct strategy and implement policies that will have the greatest impact in the Dominican Republic. Our overall strategy has succeeded in spurring e-services growth by more than 30%, including citizen services and tax services. The three main axes of our plan are citizen services, transparency, and participation.</p><h4>How successful has PuntoGob been in allowing citizens to access public services, and what are the program's future plans?</h4><p>PuntoGob is one of our most successful projects. It was designed in 2011 and implemented in 2012, and we estimate the program assists 16,500 Dominican citizens every month. This type of program has been implemented all across Latin America, especially in Brazil, and we are following the Brazilian model. Its main purpose is to enhance payment safety and reduce costs. Now, we have twelve different institutions providing 50 different services. We also plan to implement PuntoGob in Santo Domingo. We expect to have these completed in 2017.</p><h4>What is the significance of allowing different government institutions to implement digital signatures? </h4><p>We are pursuing two main goals in the area of digital signatures: creating a digital identity for every citizen and ensuring that public governmental services are as secure and fast as possible. The main objectives for the entire system will be to ensure and increase efficiency security, integrity, and speed. We are dedicated to reducing bureaucracy and transitioning to a paperless system. We want to cut costs across the institutions while ensuring that services are top notch. We believe that by moving to digital signatures we can boost the productivity of our citizens while reducing their dependence. We also wish to increase transparency and reduce instances of abuse. We are dedicated to service consolidation across the government, and we think digital signatures will play a key role in achieving this. OPTIC aims to become the certifying institution for all digital signatures by 2017. Avansi is one of the main private agents participating in the implementation of this project. They are a Spanish firm and are acting as a consultant on all aspects of the project. Currently, another institution that is authorized to provide certifications is the Chamber of Commerce and Production.</p><h4>How does OPTIC contribute to the government's larger transparency goals?</h4><p>We are the first country to have a regulatory framework around this issue in Latin America, and we belong to the association REDGEALC, an electronic government network in Latin America and South America, which includes 32 nations. This association provides a regulatory framework for our operations. One of our main efforts in terms of transparency is the NORTIC A2 best practice created in June 2013. This regulation assesses all governmental sites and was created in association with the DIGEIG. DIGEIG is a key achievement of the Medina government in its efforts to promote transparency. More than 100 governmental institutions are already certified. In order to receive this certification, an audit is performed. The most important criteria for passing this audit is the extensive use of best practices in all sites. More than 150 institutions have been certified according to this ICT framework. These standards are comprehensive, and institutions that pass have enacted a large number of changes. Additionally, NORTIC A3 will be even more responsive to the needs of the open government partnership.</p><h4>What is OPTIC's vision for how the government should use technology to improve public services, transparency, and efficiency?</h4><p>We consider online services to be a priority, particularly within the framework of the República Digital program. We want to increase customer satisfaction, boost institutional efficiency, expand the country's economy, expand the use of technology in public resources, and make governmental services and actions far more open and transparent. This will improve citizen trust. We want to have this transparency change the way citizens view their government, hopefully increasing their satisfaction and participation.</p><h4>How will the current reforms transform the Dominican Republic, and what is your vision for Dominican society in the medium term?</h4><p>In the medium term we are going to create the full field of conditions necessary to reach all citizens, bridging the gap between the most tech-savvy citizens and the least. We aim to make social networks more accessible to all citizens, and we believe the República Digital program will lead to greater levels of social inclusion. One of our other main goals is education, and we want to install broadband connections all across the country. Productivity is also key and we strive to increase it in every arena. As already mentioned, we also hope to make public services more accessible. The main long-term goal is to bring technology to every Dominican citizen, giving them the resources to access every governmental institution and thereby improving their lives.</p><h4>What are OPTIC's main objectives and goals for 2017?</h4><p>We hope to continue ensuring that open and transparent government prevails, and that digital technologies play a key part in this process. The continued implementation of the existing regulatory framework is of paramount importance as well. We want to facilitate the creation of a data center, because over 80% of public Dominican institutions need assistance in data management. This centralized governmental assistance is key. Another goal is to totally implement digital public services. And the final goal is opening another PuntoGob in Santo Domingo, so we can consolidate public services and streamline the interaction between citizens and the government.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Since Panama became a member of IFC in 1956, IFC has invested USD2 billion in the country. Which specific sectors of the Panamanian economy does IFC consider crucial for the growth of the country?</h4><p>IFC was established in 1956, and over the past 60 years has participated in many of Panama's most important projects. These include the Panama Canal expansion, the Manzanillo International Terminal in Colón, the Panama Canal Railroad Company, and the Corredor Sur toll road. We expect macroeconomic conditions to remain stable and positive in the country, with average GDP growth of 5% in the coming years. This will have a lot to do with the expanded canal. Major investments in infrastructure are also expected, such as the two new metro lines, bridges over the canal, and all the other roads and bridges planned in the last few years, not to mention the Minera Panama mining project. We think that those infrastructure, energy, logistics, and mining projects will support this macroeconomic growth in the coming four to five years. Most importantly for IFC is that these investments and this growth are also accompanied by social inclusion and environmental sustainability. The most important factor for Panama will be investment in education, both in terms of quality and access. Those are among Panama's main priorities for now. Without a strong educational foundation the country will never reach the levels of social development and poverty reduction that remains the primary national goal. At IFC, we are also targeting investments in the financial sector that will help us to reach our inclusion targets. Most of our investments are aimed at improving access to finance or supporting the lower to middle-income mortgage market, which is underdeveloped. The credit lines we provide to banks are mostly for small and medium enterprises, micro enterprises, and poor people in Panama. That is part of our inclusion agenda. We are also helping the government mitigate environmental risks and develop new efficiency measures. For example, we recently helped launch a new green building code with Panama's energy ministry. The objective is to reduce energy consumption by up to 20% in new constructions, thereby helping to curb greenhouse gas emissions.</p><h4>The creation of an environmentally sustainable plan to be applied to the energy and construction sectors is one of the priorities of Varela's Government. How is IFC working with other local institutions to instill awareness about this topic?</h4><p>In the energy sector we have an integrated approach and are investing in cleaner technologies. For example, we recently completed a USD150 million financing package for the construction and operation of Central America's first integrated liquefied natural gas (LNG) to power facility. The LNG terminal in Colón will ease the dependence on imported fossil fuels and help mitigate electricity shortages by introducing a clean, cost-effective, and reliable new energy source to the region. The facility is expected to displace at least 2,100 GWh of power currently generated from heavy fuel oil and diesel, thereby avoiding about one million tons of carbon dioxide emissions each year. That is roughly equivalent to taking more than 200,000 cars off the road. We also supported the largest wind generation project in Central America, located in the city of Penenomé. It is the largest grid-connected wind farm in Panama and will complement the country's hydro-based generation since wind resources happen to be significantly stronger during the dry season when hydro production is at its lowest. We are supporting the energy sector with investments both in cleaner technologies and also by promoting energy efficiency initiatives, such as the advisory project we just completed with the Secretary of Energy for the green building code for Panama that focuses on reducing the energy consumption for new buildings. We have seen a committed administration led by the national Secretary of Energy, and it is part of the bigger strategy of the government which recently launched their long-term energy plan for 2050. The plan contains points and objectives regarding both a cleaner energy matrix with the inclusion of gas and renewables, the replacement of fossil fuels, more energy efficiency, and initiatives regarding transportation. The LNG project will help not only the power sector but other sectors be more environmentally friendly, including through the future use of gas for transport, for example. There will be other commercial and industrial uses as well, thus helping the country become more environmentally friendly, reduce its industrial and commercial footprint, and be more environmentally sustainable. In that sense, we are completely aligned with the government's long-term energy plans. As for financial inclusion, we provide financing for local commercial banks to lend to small and medium enterprises, micro enterprises, and provide mortgages for the poor. We are also providing credit lines to banks to support solutions for smart climate projects. We are also considering projects to help the country's capital markets through innovative financial structures. I would say that our plans in Panama complement both the financial and energy infrastructure as well as the real estate sector to create better, more sustainable, and more inclusive economic growth.</p><h4>How can the LNG project you are undertaking help establish Panama as a regional hub in the energy and LNG sectors?</h4><p>Given the strategic location of Panama, it will help the country launch new business opportunities in LNG and other energy projects. The project we just closed is at the Atlantic entrance of the Panama Canal and part of the LNG production will be used in another power plant project, a total of 380MW. Other power plants could be converted from fossil fuels to natural gas—there are many opportunities for this. If the economics makes sense, it could be great for the country—commercially, environmentally, and in terms of transportation. There are also other countries in Central America and the Caribbean, which might benefit from transshipping gas they need from here, taking it to their country, or re-exporting it from Panama. I do believe there is a huge potential for Panama to become an LNG hub for the Caribbean and Central America. In addition to its direct benefits, natural gas offers synergies with renewable energy. The LNG facility will provide cleaner and more affordable base load power to complement the inherent variability of wind and solar energy. This will make it possible to integrate more renewable power projects into the grid, while balancing electric system loads and ensuring a continuous supply of electricity.</p><h4>Why is it so difficult for a small country with just 4 million people and with many opportunities and resources at its disposal to be able to distribute income more equally?</h4><p>Poverty is mainly concentrated in indigenous communities, which are quite isolated from the rest of Panama's urban population. That is where you see the greatest inequality, with insufficient water, electricity, education, and health resources. There is a lot of room for improvement and the government is working to help these communities and to create opportunities for them.</p><h4>What are your targets and objectives for 2017?</h4><p>We will continue concentrating on the financial sector, infrastructure, and energy over the coming year. We will continue to support our three pillars: SMEs, mortgages, and smart climate solutions, not to mention the electricity sector, with an emphasis on transmission. We will take advantage of the new opportunities that are on the way in the coming years. We will also explore new projects in ports and logistics that are extremely important for the country. Another priority at IFC is related to women: one of our commitments is to promote best practice in corporate governance in emerging markets, and one important element is gender diversity on boards. The representation of women on boards is extremely low across Latin America and for this reason we are supporting initiatives such as the Panama association of Corporate Directors, known as WCD Panama. WCD Panama is doing a great job of attracting talented women and encouraging companies to have more diverse boards, as a good corporate governance practice.  It is proven that diverse boards are more effective and have a positive impact on companies.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>One of your initiatives focuses on limiting food loss and food waste. What do you think can be achieved here?</h4><p>The MySaveFood Initiative was launched in March 2016 by the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister of Agriculture and Agro-based Industries, and the Director General of the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of United Nations, Dr. José Graziano da Silva. It features two components, first of all to raise awareness of food loss and wastage and secondly to build a network and link between the government, NGOs, and industry that can drive the force of this initiative by itself. The message that we wish to convey to everyone is to value food and not waste as it takes a lot of resources, energy, and time to put food on the table. Lack of concern for food loss and waste across the value chain can have detrimental effects to our food security, environment, health, and economy. Thus far, the initiative has picked up momentum and the Malaysian community is in agreement that food loss and waste should be reduced. Food loss is not commonly seen by consumers because it occurs along the food chain from harvesting and transportation to milling and storing. The figures are quite disturbing. For example, around 28.5% of rice is lost in a year in Malaysia. In total, one-third of our total harvest is lost before it reaches the dinner table—a figure that is average for our region, but high compared to developed countries. The figures for food waste are also staggering. The MYSaveFood partner Solid Waste And Public Cleansing Management Corporation (SWCorp) conducted a study and found that 15,000 tons of cooked food is wasted per day in Malaysia, of which 3,000 tons can in fact be consumed. We are happy that the NGOs partners have made efforts to collect almost-expired products from supermarkets to be redistributed to the needy. Again, our initiative aims to target the source of the waste and loss, ignite a network of organizations that support this objective, and educate the private sector on their responsibilities as well. MARDI specifically has many roles in this initiative. We not only develop technologies to reduce post-harvest losses, but we are also developing composting technologies to help reduce the amount of food waste reaching the landfills. Promoting healthy meal portions can also reduce food waste, hence MARDI has introduced Nutrima “Bento Box" meals to help curb food waste in its campus.</p><h4>You have been outspoken about fruit diversity, for environmental as well as commercial reasons. Can you tell us more about your plans to enhance diversity here? </h4><p>Fruit diversity is an exclusive value of this region and is important for the future. It is also something that can be utilized and monetized. Some fruits have commercial value but some have other traits that need to be conserved and utilized. For example, the exotic king of the fruits, durian, has a unique and indigenous flavor only to be found naturally here in this region. Malaysia is already known as a major producer of durian. However, it is a seasonal fruit and, therefore, it is quite challenging to commercialize. This is the same for many other Malaysian fruits. Hence, MARDI has programs to look at fruit diversity and rare fruits. We have collected around 40 different types of rare fruits to evaluate, characterize, and potentially monetize. We also explore the possibility of using these fruits for other purposes. Most of these fruits have unique characteristics compared to more common fruits, for example, high levels of antioxidants. Since our research is always two-fold; which is to focus on producing public goods as well as for wealth creation, MARDI utilizes fruit diversity to develop nutritious products for wellness purposes. One example is tapping the global wellness market which is a trillion dollar business with products containing anti-aging citrus and tropical fruits rich in antioxidants.</p><h4>Do you coordinate with universities and other institutes and companies to conduct this research? </h4><p>We have built up a great web of network of local and international entities. Academics can conduct most of the fundamental sciences while we do the applied sciences, and in that sense we complement each other. We are mostly interested in products, the production process, and the commercialization of our research. Internationally, we collaborate through a number of sectoral and branch-specific partnerships, which among others include the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the Asia Pacific Association of Research Institutes (APAARI), the Institute of Rice Research (IRRI), the Council for Rice Research in Asia (CORRA), the Food and Fertilizer Technology Centre (FFTC), and The World Vegetable Centre (AVRDC). We are also active in collaborating with many institutions across the regions and are active contributors to many ASEAN and APEC programs. These not only present test cases for our own ideas but also identify global trends in the industry. We also collaborate with international companies such as Nestle and BASF to ensure our products not only benefit our nation but are able to penetrate world markets as well.</p><h4>How should rice production in Malaysia innovate?</h4><p>As a staple food of Malaysia, it is of great importance to sustain the rice industry.  However, rice is a challenging industry for Malaysia by virtue of its high cost of production compared to the current world price. Over the years, MARDI has developed more than 40 rice varieties, and they are planted in more than 90% of Malaysian granary areas. However, with climate change and new types of pests and diseases, it is always recommended to cultivate new varieties to combat disease and have resistant yields. Flavored and colored rice are other products that we look into, especially since colored rice has many health benefits. We launched a program called Eat a Rainbow, for which we currently promote eating colored agriculture produce including red and black rice. As a rule of thumb, a diet comprising seven colors a day keeps the doctor away; therefore, it is part of a nutritious diet to introduce more colors into one's diet. Colored food has anthocyanins, which is important to combat cancer. This fits with the growing trend in urban centers in which people opt for a few spoonfuls of quality rice rather than a bowl of lower-quality rice.</p><h4>What are your ambitions for the years ahead?</h4><p>Leveraging the success of the MySaveFood initiative, we wish to create new boundaries and make more positive impacts to the country's agriculture industry. There are many other initiatives we are working on but one global trend we are looking into at the moment is superfoods, which has attracted a great deal of attention. For example, we have developed honey from stingless bees or “kelulut" and seek to commercialize this unique product. This honey has quite a different composition and has at least four to 10 times the amount of antioxidants and a lower percentage of reducing sugar compared to commercial honey. It has great health benefits and can treat ulcers or be applied to skin as well. We launched this product under our new brand and packaging — Nutrima by MARDI. We pledge to also continue focusing on developing public goods and technologies while understanding challenges to our agricultural industry such as climate change. This includes promoting new varieties and new agricultural practices to respond to higher temperatures, drought, or flooding in certain areas. Mechanization is the way forward in our industry as a whole, and we need to extend more effort into precision farming in order to import less labor. One challenge, which is an issue for the R&amp;D sector in general, is visibility. We have to increase the visibility of MARDI so that the nation is aware and can utilize our many outputs developed over the years. To do this, commercialization of our research findings is now among one of our most important agenda. We have developed the MARDI logo as a symbol for quality innovation, and products which carry the MARDI logo will be automatically recognized as a high quality and reliable agriculture product. This is the way we create greater visibility amongst consumers and we hope this will encourage many young 'agri-preneurs' to venture into agriculture, materialize their ideas, and use our branding.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In Qatar National Vision 2030 (QNV2030), more emphasis is being placed on generating revenue from the non-oil and gas sectors of Qatar. What impact will this have on future business opportunities for the Alfardan Group?</h4><p>Alfardan Group has always been committed to supporting the initiatives of the government and is dedicated to developing business strategies that complement the wise leadership of HH Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Bin Khalifa Al Thani, Emir of the State of Qatar. QNV2030 is one such example. It increasingly emphasizes the importance of cultivating the non-hydrocarbon sector to achieve a more diversified post-oil economy. As one of the oldest businesses in the country, much of our success is driven by our ability to adapt to growing trends within the local business landscape and to participate in the creation of new markets. From our humble beginnings in the pearling industry, which led to the establishment of Alfardan Jewellery, we have expanded to become the premier choice in various industry verticals including the automotive, jewellery, exchange, property development, and hospitality industries, as well as marine services and investment markets. Diversification has always defined Alfardan Group as we continue to expand into new fields and create new benchmarks of excellence in that arena.</p><h4>How is Alfardan Properties integrating smart property developments and solutions in order to advance Doha as a smart city?</h4><p>Alfardan Properties has always been eager to adopt emerging technologies that enhance services and promote the safety, security, and overall well-being of tenants. We aim to transform and exceed our clients' expectations, as well as support the initiatives of the government to turn Doha into a major smart city. We continuously look for ways to utilize sophisticated technology to enhance our facilities based on our customers' unique needs and tastes. We are proud to say our dedication has borne fruit, as Alfardan Properties was named Smart Property Developer of the Year at the fourth Arab Future Cities Summit Qatar, held under the patronage of the Ministry of Municipality and Environment. At the summit, we had a representative speak about Smart Living Solutions, to share our own experience in delivering comprehensive solutions and services as well as the tools and platforms that we utilize to remain effective while meeting our sustainability goals in support of the key indicators set by QNV2030.</p><h4>Marking 20 years since the establishment of Alfardan's Automotive Operations division, how has this segment expanded over its many years in this market?</h4><p>Alfardan Group Automotive Operations was established in 1996 as part of the group's efforts to diversify its portfolio and in recognition of the growing demand for quality and luxury automotive dealers and service centers. We set ourselves apart in the market by providing unparalleled after-sales customer care and by aligning with iconic brands in the automotive industry. As a result, we have had many pioneering business strategies over the years. In fact, Alfardan Automobiles became Qatar's official importer of BMW, MINI, and Rolls-Royce cars, and distinguished itself with its state-of-the-art showrooms, fully staffed with skilled personnel. Alfardan Sports Motors continued to reinforce this luxury brand image, becoming the importer of two of the most coveted brands, Ferrari and Maserati. Alfardan Premier Motors, on the other hand, became the official importer for Jaguar and Land Rover, while Alfardan Motorcycles began to offer notable brands such as BMW Motorrad, Ducati, Triumph, and more. Following these achievements, Prestige Cars was established to address the need for luxury leasing and limousine rental services. Thus, in our unwavering commitment to quality and customer service, we became the preferred exclusive distributors of global luxury brands in Qatar. During recent years, we moved to establish two companies under our Automotive Operations Division. Both Auto Future Tech, the official distributor of Castrol lubricants and Continental tires, and ARACO, one of Qatar's leading providers of earth-moving machinery, have been successfully providing exceptional services with far-reaching benefits in keeping with our legacy and commitment to excellence and quality. Moreover, to sustain our achievements in this sector and further widen our reach in the region, we launched Alfardan Motors in Oman, the exclusive distributor of Ferrari, Maserati, and luxury motorcycle brands.</p><h4>With a corporate vision to be a regional leader, what is Alfardan's footprint in the region outside of Qatar?</h4><p>The success of Alfardan Group is largely founded on our refusal to compromise on providing quality products and services. Thus, we provide the same standards of value-added options to customers outside the country to showcase what Qatar can offer. Accordingly, we have several projects in the pipeline in Oman under Alfardan Properties and Alfardan Motors that will further bolster our position in the Middle East market. The group also continues to make its name synonymous with luxury and fine taste in the field of real estate with the Fina'a Alazaibah complex in Oman, the Group's first property development project outside Qatar. In addition, we have several strategically placed Alfardan Jewellery branches across the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to address the growing demand within the country. In Saudi Arabia, we have embarked on large-scale property development ventures, with the commercial tower Burj Alfardan in Al Khobar as one of our major projects. Expanding our presence in Turkey also forms part of our strategy to bring Alfardan's signature luxury brand to the next phase of unprecedented regional and global growth.</p><h4>Are there any particular sectors in which Alfardan is looking to expand into or initiate development, either within Qatar or internationally?</h4><p>Alfardan Group thrives to expand and innovate within the various sectors it operates in, both in the region and beyond. In addition, Alfardan Trading Limited and Alfardan Holding are also operating in foreign markets with many strategic interests in countries such as Saudi Arabia, Oman, and Turkey. We have many projects on the horizon and are eager to bring our luxury brand and quality products and services to a wider network, while remaining true to our heritage and values. Our first project outside of Qatar, Fina'a Alazaibah in Oman, has received strong and positive feedback and fueled our relentless drive to constantly diversify our business and expand interests in key industries and markets. In addition to this, we continue to strengthen our hold on various markets in Qatar, and with the country's winning bid to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, this will only serve to attract more foreign investors to the country.</p><h4>What are some of your main targets for the company over the next 12 months?</h4><p>In the coming months as well as in the following years, we will continuously espouse our values of premium quality products and services to our rapidly expanding markets in various industries. We will maintain the spirit of innovation that has brought us our success and will look to venture into new markets in an effort to engage with new buyers from various demographics. We will also continue to actively participate in helping the country meet its environmental and sustainable needs by creating new products to that end. Our support for the government's long-term socio-economic programs and the vision of our wise leaders remains unwavering. We will demonstrate this commitment by steadily pursuing the best practices in the local, regional, and global landscapes to help sustain the flourishing economy of Qatar.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Jagal Energy is the oil and gas solutions provider of Jagal, and a prominent player in the Nigerian upstream sector. How are low oil prices affecting your operations?</h4><p>Across the world, low oil prices are challenging companies to think differently, change the way they do business, and look for innovative solutions. We need to understand how to do things more economically. For our energy division, we operate as contractors and have a lot of joint ventures and strategic alliances. We experienced a decline in work and in future work on the table. Previously, we were bidding on numerous projects at the same time. Today, we have very few projects on the horizon. At Jagal Energy, we have wholly-owned indigenous companies, such as Nigerdock, and we also have partnerships like NigerStar7. We look at different sectors and try to be more efficient in our management and our supply chain, utilizing different strengths that we have across our group in an attempt to leverage them so that we can all benefit during tough times and reduce our overall cost base.</p><h4>The government is working on a new petroleum regulatory framework. How do you expect this legislation to influence the future of the sector in Nigeria?</h4><p>The most important legislation for the sector has been the Nigerian Content Development Act. It has made sure that companies that have capacity in-country are able to bid on and domicile supply chain, procurement, engineering, and fabrication contracts. As a result, the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) the government is developing has to be compatible with what Nigeria has to offer. Many companies have built up capacity across many different parts of the industry and they need to be utilized and put to work. There are many Nigerians who have high levels of competency, but we are losing them because of a lack of work. It is important that the government engage their partners in the IOCs and the local oil companies, as well as the private companies offering engineering service, supply chain, logistics, and offshore drilling support. The whole industry needs to come together, because sometimes a framework may be suitable to one aspect of the industry, but that risks losing business on other sides of the business spectrum.</p><h4>What are your strategic priorities for Jagal Energy in 2016?</h4><p>This year is a survival year. A lot of companies are trying to manage the downturn. Our strategy is to push for work and see if we can partner with IOCs and the NNPC to unlock projects and work together to find solutions, because it would be a shame to have such an excellent capability in-country in our sector and lose it due to lack of communication or progress on projects.</p><h4>Nigerdock has invested over USD500 million to enhance the capabilities on offer that support oil and gas projects, including offshore fabrication and ship repair. What does this investment mean for Jagal?</h4><p>We have been investing in our capacity for the past decade. Our shipyard is the largest facility of its kind in West Africa. It has a 25,000DWT graving dock, a 3,500DWT floating dock, multiple quayside facilities and weather-proof, multi-purpose workshops. We operate under strict guidelines on quality control and are fully certified. We are trying to attract vessels that are operating on the West African coast, not just in Nigeria. We are investing in that capacity in order to offer services to the whole Gulf of Guinea region. This is a long-term strategy and our facility is constantly being assessed in terms of quality, productivity, turnaround time for vessels, as well as rig repair and maintenance. It is one of our core businesses on Snake Island. Other business streams include Project Delivery, Offshore Fabrication, Support Base Services, and Industrial Training creating a one-stop-shop for our clients. It is a complementary part of the whole vision and is enhanced by being strategically located at the Snake Island Integrated Free Zone, which is critical to support offshore projects and the shipping industry as well.</p><h4>Can you talk about the evolution for the demand for Hello Products?</h4><p>Manufacturing across Nigeria has taken a hit from the foreign exchange issue. It has made access to raw materials a challenge and consequently this has had an impact on the ability to produce finished goods. The supply chain and time cycle for turning raw materials into finished goods is impacting a lot of manufacturers, and many of them have closed up shop because of that. Hello Products has been manufacturing for over 35 years. We have a range of products and most of our raw materials are locally sourced. However, we have some key ingredients that are only made in two or three places in the world. We are forced to import these raw materials. Aside from manufacturing, the cost of goods for the common Nigerian has also risen dramatically, and this is compounded by inflation and price instability. Nevertheless, we have a couple of new products in the pipeline. We are enhancing our existing product line and improving our manufacturing cycle. We are trying to reduce the cost base, and invest. With the naira you are losing value every day, so what we have to do is to reinvest in our brand and products to support our business.</p><h4>What role is Jagal playing in terms of employment generation in Nigeria?</h4><p>We are one of the largest employers in Nigeria. Across the entire group we employ around 10,000 people. We have a technical training center on Snake Island, and we engage a lot of the youth in training. The training center consists of workshops and machining rooms that are fully equipped with welding booths, pipe-fitting benches, lathes, milling machines, fully equipped classrooms, an ICT room and a comprehensive technical library. To date this facility has trained over 6,000 personnel in a range of skills including project management, quality, occupational health and safety, welding, fitting, painting and coating, machining, lifting, rigging, and scaffolding. We believe that there is so much talent in Nigeria that we have to unlock. However, we are restricted by the amount of work that we have at any one time. The biggest problem is that we want to retain talent and to retain them we need a backlog of work.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>Nigeria is making difficult decisions, but they are the right ones. The government is not there to be popular. Nigeria is trying to address critical gaps in its economy. It is important to see Nigeria diversify its portfolio so that it is not reliant on just one industry. At Jagal, we engage in other forms of investment and revenue yielding businesses besides oil and gas. Jagal has made significant investments to ensure the domestication of data in Nigeria. Rack Centre, a state-of-the art, TIER III-certified data center that offers vendor-neutral colocation services has been operational since 2014. The center operates to global standards including ISO 20000, and offers energy-efficient and secure data storage. We are now providing data center services to some key international blue chip corporate organizations. Nigeria must now take the bold step of domestication of all its data in-country, a move that will be in line with the president's economic diversification efforts. Nigeria also needs to improve its dialog with partners. After that, the tough decisions must be implemented so that we can start to see the benefit across the sectors and improvement in the investment climate. Nigeria is a country that has an incredible population, and a fantastic need for investment, innovation, technology and infrastructure, across all sectors. The banking sector has a lot to do with improving this. It is not just about big business, it is about SMEs, and this is what will drive the economy of Nigeria. Big manufacturing will create big employment, and trade around that will further create more employment. The supply chain will kick off and snowball into something else.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What factors contribute to high levels of growth year after year in the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>This is one of the fastest growing economies in all of Latin America and that has been true for the past two decades. This is due to two main factors. One is the generally positive external environment, and the other is sound government policy. Between 1992 and 2000, annual average growth was 6.7%, the best annual performance in the region, and between 2001 and 2013 it remained positive at 5.1%, despite the banking crisis. From 2014-15, growth has been even higher, reaching an average of 7%. The reasons for this high growth are a substantial increase in productivity and strong domestic demand, both of which are driven by factors such as tourism, factory production, and construction. There is also a strong private construction market, particularly thanks to a low inflation environment that remained under 1% in 2015. Thanks to growth in other countries, we have had a high level of remittances and FDI. Foreign investment has been historically quite high in the Dominican Republic. In 2012, it was USD5.6 billion, in 2013 USD2.6 billion, and in 2014 it reached USD3.7 billion. These numbers have been very important for job creation in the country. In general, there has been substantial improvement of GNI per capita in the Dominican Republic. In 1992, the average per capita income was 57% of the regional average. In 2015, it was 90%. According to some projections, if this growth continues the gap will be closed in 2020.</p><h4>How is the USD120 million Electricity Distribution Grid Modernization and Loss Reduction project progressing?</h4><p>This is an important project because the electricity sector is one of the most challenging issues in the country. It is critical, first of all, from a fiscal point of view, as the government spends about 1.3% of GDP on providing subsidies to the electricity sector. Our project aims to reduce the loss of electricity and improve the supply. Through this project approximately 200,000 consumers across 18 circuits will benefit from improved service quality and availability as a result of the grid modernization, loss reduction, and social outreach work. The project will support 'social compacts' between the distribution companies and consumers to help increase customer payments and reduce power outages. The program will contribute to increased cost recovery and reducing the need for subsidies to the distribution companies. This project will certainly have an impact on the poorest, but will also improve private development in the region. One of the things that is keeping potential investors out of the country is the lack of electricity. Thus, the government is committed to improving this and has launched an Electricity Pact to try and find a consensus among all the players on how the sector can best structure the system.</p><h4>What impact have the huge inflows of FDI from multinational companies had on the local economy?</h4><p>FDI is critical. One of the issues the World Bank is focusing on is trying to help the country improve its investment climate. FDI is critical for many reasons. First of all, it helps offset the balance of payments, but more importantly, it helps generate growth. When you generate job growth, it becomes easier to generate revenue for the country. This can then be redistributed and invested in public service, which is critical. Keeping a high level of FDI is challenging, but is also important in a country where reducing poverty is still an issue.</p><h4>What does the World Bank see as the biggest obstacles in terms of equality and inclusive growth for the entire population?</h4><p>This is the main challenge for the country and the main focus of the activities of the World Bank. The high growth of the past has not corresponded to similar levels of poverty reduction. Over the last 15 years, the percentage of people who moved from the vulnerable class to the middle class has only been 7%, compared to a regional average of 41%, while 85% remained in the vulnerable class and 8% actually moved to a lower class. It is clear that there is a disconnection between growth and the capacity to escape poverty in the Dominican Republic, which the government urgently needs to address. A lot of effort has been made by the government to combat poverty, particularly over the past two years. Poverty was reduced by about 10% between 2014 and 2015. The average per capita income of the bottom 40% has increased on average by 2.5%, while the top 60% has grown lower. Therefore, today, there are some trends that are indeed very positive in terms of poverty reduction and shared prosperity, but there is still a lot that needs to be done. Some of the remaining problems are related to the lack of elasticity in the labor market. There has been a huge growth in productivity, but this has not corresponded at the level of real wages that have allowed the poorest segments of the population to escape poverty. Another related issue is the fragmentation of the economy and the lack of links between different economic zones. One important part of DR's economy are the special economic zones, which allows us to develop high value-added sectors. The problem is that these don't spill over as they should into other sectors of the economy. The lack of quality in the provision of public services is another piece of this puzzle and is an issue where the World Bank is focused. Therefore, education, healthcare, and social protection need more attention from the government, especially with regard to quality improvements. The World Bank focuses on many activities in these fields. For example a USD75 million social protection and promotion project focuses on the 14 poorest provinces of the country. A USD50 million education project aims at improving the quality of the sector by focusing on improving the quality of pre-university education through the National Pact for Education.</p><h4>Is the large informal economy a hindrance to growth?</h4><p>This is a big problem and a fiscal issue because when you have a lot of people in the informal sector then the state loses revenue. It is important from both ours and the government's perspective to see what can be done to improve the fiscal situation. The government has committed to creating incentives for the private sector to make employment more formal, but this is a challenge that cannot be overcome in a short time. We certainly need to continue working with the Government on horizontal interventions aimed at improving the business climate without which the private sector becomes weaker. We want to be sure that the private sector environment is conducive to generating growth and business. Then, we need to look at some vertical interventions, meaning by focusing on some of the leading sectors of the economy.</p><h4>What sectors will hold the most potential for job creation in the next five years?</h4><p>The current leading sectors of the economy have the potential to continue to be engines for creating jobs and pushing inclusive growth. There is still potential in tourism and agribusiness, including eco-tourism and adventure tourism. However, it is important to focus on improving the environment for private sector activities, including making efforts to lower electricity prices. In addition, the provision of social services, as well as water and sanitation, are critical for the whole economy and making growth more inclusive.  </p><h4>What is your outlook for the Dominican economy in 2017?</h4><p>The Dominican Republic remains the country with the highest growth levels in the Americas. Annual GDP growth is projected to be around 4.6% on average between 2017 and 2018, much higher than the average of the LAC region projected at around 1.7%. At the same time, the fiscal deficit is around 3.5 percent of GDP. The fiscal deficit of the non-financial public sector is projected to be around -3.5% in 2017-18. The primary balance, despite indications of improvement, is expected to be negative in the same period, which will contribute to an increase in debt. Meanwhile, the strong growth and improved economic and financial reputation that the government has built in recent years is allowing the country to diversify its funding resources and allow it to enjoy comfortable refinancing options.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your vision for the future of ASEAN economic integration?</h4><p>ASEAN is a dynamic region with excellent growth prospects, a young population, and a rising middle class that is becoming ever more affluent. Within ASEAN we are competing to attract multinationals to set up their regional or global headquarters, and this is driving us all to build better infrastructure and a more attractive business ecosystem. In addition, having prosperous and stable neighbors around is great for any country, and an increasingly stable ASEAN benefits all countries. Whether multinationals consider ASEAN to be a single entity or choose to have Malaysia as part of their value chain in the region, in both cases there is a great advantage to having access to a large market without internal trade duties. Intra-trade within the EU currently stands at 70%, compared to 24% within ASEAN, as we do not enjoy seamless trade of goods and services across borders yet. However, we are moving toward convergence, uniform standards, and reducing barriers. In December 2015, we declared ourselves an ASEAN Community and stated three pillars: political security, economy, and social development. The levels of development are different, and we have different cultures and languages. We have expressed our commitment to achieving closer integration. During the Laos summit, we reviewed the first year of ASEAN as a community, and looked ahead on the implementation of AEC and the Blueprint 2025, which should make us more cohesive. Topics for discussion included reducing non-tariff and tariff barriers—the latter ones are almost zero except for Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Vietnam, who will follow in 2018. Furthermore, we discussed in Laos how we could coordinate infrastructural development as a tool for closer integration.</p><h4>Currently, Malaysia is in the process of signing the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the China-initiated Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). How will an open market of 3 billion inhabitants affect the Malaysian economy and its competitiveness?</h4><p>As a trading nation with a limited domestic market of 30 million people, we need to constantly look beyond our borders for trade, investment, and economic growth. To date, Malaysia has signed and implemented 13 FTAs that have boosted our trade and opened up numerous opportunities for our local companies. Malaysia currently ranks as the 23rd largest exporting nation but we cannot be too reliant and should continuously aim to diversify our trade. Our entry into the TPP, together with 11 other nations with a combined GDP of USD27.5 trillion, would mean a significant expansion of our trade opportunities, particularly in the US, Canada, Mexico, and Peru, with whom we currently do not have preferential access. However, statements by President-elect Trump raise doubts about TPP ratification, though maybe the dynamics will change. We need to wait for a clearer idea about what will happen, but Malaysia is prepared for any eventuality. The RCEP, which is currently under negotiation, presents additional opportunities for us, including greater access to 16 countries with a total population of almost half of the entire world and a combined GDP of USD22.7 trillion. Aligning ourselves with the countries that represent the fastest-growing economies will truly enhance our competitiveness in the world. Negotiations on RCEP have been ongoing for two years, and as we get closer to the finish line, we have more challenges to finalize, mainly because there are different levels of ambitions and development among the participants. Similarly, some countries favor free movement of people and labor, while others see this as a threat. In Malaysia, we are relatively open, but before completely opening up it is important to take care of our own people as well. Globalization is irreversible, and these FTAs serve as building blocks for a more comprehensive agreement in the Asia Pacific region. We need to prepare our companies so they understand how to reap the benefits of closer integration in the global economy.<br></p><h4>Malaysia is in the middle of a 10-year long, MYR100 billion investment program for infrastructure. How will this enhance the attractiveness of Malaysia as an investment destination?</h4><p>Infrastructure and connectivity are critical in supporting economic growth as they improve production and logistical efficiency. Our network of first-class infrastructure now includes multiple nationwide highways, seaports, airports, 4G networks, industrial parks, and integrated economic zones. The North-South highway over peninsular Malaysia was a game changer and a starting point for further highway development in the country. In 2014, the World Bank ranked us 25th in the global Logistics Performance Index, in particular because of our strategic location in the Straits of Malacca and our sophisticated ports. With a compound annual growth rate of 20% in our cargo and container volume, we are currently working to increase capacity, for example at the Malacca gateway project. In Kuala Lumpur, we have made strategic investments in the expansion of our public transport system, with a recent extension of our LRT network and the opening of phase one of our MRT system in December. The projected High-Speed Rail (HSR) to Singapore, for which both prime ministers concluded an MoU in 2016, will cut travel time between the two capitals to just 100 minutes—another major boost for our bilateral relations there.</p><h4>How would you evaluate foreign investment into your manufacturing and services sectors and what should be done to unlock their full potential?</h4><p>We secured a total approved investment of MYR186.7 billion in these sectors in 2016, comprising almost 5,000 projects. Our focus is to attract quality investments, knowledge, and capital, with strong linkages to domestic industries. The aerospace industry is a great example of this, and we have seen this sector grow from MYR900 million in 1998 to MYR12.6 billion in 2015. There are currently around 200 companies active in this sector, including industry giants Boeing, Airbus, and Rolls Royce, employing almost 20,000 people. The fact that the government has managed to reduce its dependency on oil-related revenue from 41.2% to 21.1% demonstrates how we are moving toward high-value adding manufacturing. We anticipate further reducing this dependency to 15% in 2017 as part of our strategy moving forward.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>The ministry is optimistic about overall economic growth prospects for Malaysia, and we expect that private investments will continue to be the key growth catalyst next year and will keep growing at 9.4% per year. In 2016, we anticipate a total of almost MYR300 billion in investment. The services sector will continue to be the key driver of growth, and is projected to increase by 6.9% per annum, ultimately increasing its share of the total GDP from 53.8% in 2015 to 56.5% in 2020. As we have committed ourselves to a target of 60% by 2020, we will try to unlock the full potential of the sector with the Services Sector Blueprint, transforming the industry to become more innovative and knowledge-intensive.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What major decisions and changes have taken place at The House Group over the past year?</h4><p>First of all we opened The House Café Baku in 2014. Again, last year, we signed a franchise agreement with a company called Oryx Group for Food Services from Doha, which has different brands in its portfolio like Nandos, Juice Zone, and a few other local brands. According to our franchise agreement, Oryx should open two more The House Cafés in Doha in three years time. And we believe that this will open our doors to the Middle East with so many future growth opportunities. It is always very important that someone from the same sector takes the franchise, and this usually means it will be a success. In the meantime, almost two years ago we created a new concept/new brand in our portfolio called Nopa, which is a modern European brasserie with its mostly Mediterranean cuisine with its local blend menu. It was designed by the Autoban architectural company like all our other cafes and hotels. Recently, we have been more focused on franchising. Our franchising strategy is quite conservative because it is very important to choose a good venue with the right partner. We believe The House Café concept is not for the masses; it is a boutique concept. It should not be everywhere and cannot be a mass chain. We still want to keep fresh flowers on our tables and we still want to tailor our services to our guests. We are in all the best locations in Istanbul. As The House Café, we focus more on international franchising opportunities rather than local, as we believe our concept is very much appreciated at the international level. From the hotel side, we opened The Vault Karaköy by The House Hotel, which has 63 rooms. It is in an old, historic building originally built for Credit General Ottoman Bank in 1863 and was expertly renovated and turned into a The House Hotel in 2014. As The House Hotel Group, this was our first investor-based project, while our initial 3 Hotels—The House Hotel Nişantaşı, Ortaköy, and Galatasaray—were completely renovated and turned into hotels by ourselves, and we worked with an investor. Accordingly, in 2015 we signed the agreement—The House Residence project—with another investor. Project in Bomonti is a residential project and is our first time in this segment. That was a different step for The House Group. This is a project with 155 residents and we will manage the entire property as The House Residence Management. It will open in late 2016 or the beginning of 2017. There will also be The House Hotel with 51 rooms. This is a new concept for us. We have been in contact with many project owners and are negotiating with them; we plan to grow in the residence business as well. We are dealing with a few now, though nothing has been sorted yet. That said, we signed the The House Residence Bomonti about one year ago. In addition, there is an interesting project in Cappadocia. Our investor there is in love with Cappadocia and had started buying old Armenian houses and decided to establish a hotel. However, as his core business is not hospitality, he sought to work with a hotel brand here and we met in 2014 and The House Hotel Cappadocia opened in June 2015. Cappadocia is a unique place. We were already seeking to open a hotel in the area because it is economically, commercially, and spiritually amazing. After Istanbul, it is the second biggest opportunity for our hotels. It is such a special place with a unique history and unique features. The places he had bought were mostly cave houses. Now we have 29 rooms and the second phase is under construction at the moment but will be open very soon. With the new phase THH Cappadocia will have 45 rooms in total, and more than half of the rooms are original cave rooms. Some of these rooms were used to ferment wine, others used as kitchens. Recently, while the new phase of construction was under way, a beautiful chapel from an old church was discovered. This chapel is being carefully restored and will be used for events and organizations. As you can guess we are facing a really tough time at the moment, especially in the hospitality sector due to the fact that there is a reduced number of tourists in the country. At the same time, Turkey is a strong and dynamic country, and it will recover.</p><h4>How has the significant and early investment by Kerten private equity influenced the growth of your business?</h4><p>Kerten is a private equity firm; it is a personal fund and invested in us in 2010 when we were still at the very beginning of our hotel business. When we did this merging we had just built our first hotel, The House Hotel Galatasaray, but with this partnership we can take advantage of growth opportunity in the sector.</p><h4>What new markets are you exploring?</h4><p>We are open to either new partnerships or franchising opportunities abroad. Because of both regional proximity and cultural similarities, the Middle East is a priority for us at the moment. For example, Dubai could be a good place for The House Café. We have so many loyal customers from that region and they really love and appreciate our concept. Besides, we are also thinking of expanding to some European cities as well. London could be possible. I have British residency. I studied in London for a while and spend a lot time in London. It is an amazing city with a great food and beverage market as well. I have a very good network in the sector and we often discuss our thoughts that The House Café could be a success in London. As The House Hotel, we have not yet gone outside of Turkey; however, we are also open for a possible international partnership, franchising, or management contract opportunities. Our partner on the hotel side is actively seeking international growth. On the other hand we cannot ignore the fact that as a sector we are passing through a very difficult time. That's why our primary concentration right now is our existing hotels.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What would you consider your main achievements at the National Heart Institute?</h4><p>We are considered one of the leading cardiac centers in Asia Pacific. In terms of volume, we only come behind some centers in China and India. We take pride in our high standards—we have an international JCI accreditation. A group of Australian heart surgeons called us the Cleveland Clinic of Asia. Many of our consultants are key opinion leaders in Asia Pacific and are often invited to give scientific talks. We combine our clinical care with a strong research agenda and publish our studies in international publications. We participate in medical trials too. Initially, the hospital was providing cardiac treatment for Malaysians, but as our quality reached much higher international standards we developed a large foreign patient base. At the same time, we have grown to become a reference point for training and research. We provide training to many young doctors around the region, including the Middle East, Japan, and other countries in Southeast Asia. We have trained nearly 120 doctors who have spent at least one year with us. The fact that these young doctors later choose to work with us is another measure of our quality.</p><h4>How do you structure cardiovascular research in the hospital? </h4><p>Our research department has statisticians and clinical researchers working together, supporting our broader clinical research agenda. Our strength here is the volumes we have; the insights we gain are based on a large patient base. Our research is focused on clinical research and on improving our healthcare services in practice. The more elementary research takes place in another center, where we partner with University Technology Malaysia's (UTM) cardiovascular bioengineering department. There is a great deal of joint research between engineers, PhD students, and our doctors here, and this collaboration allows us to structure our research assets well. Funding is split between the government, the university, and us. We have a funding vehicle, the IJN Foundation, through which we receive corporate donations and to which we also contribute 1% of our annual revenue. Half of the funding is intended to subsidize patients who cannot afford healthcare while the other half is for research projects and education. This fund allows us to acquire new technology and offer treatments that would otherwise be too expensive. For example, via the IJN Foundation we invested in a heart assistance device that cost MYR500,000 and allowed us to be at the forefront of cardiovascular technology and skills. The large funding we have available for training is also our unique asset, to keep our staff at the highest demands and to retain our top doctors and give them a satisfying career. We are a government-owned hospital, but we run it as a private enterprise. We are completely responsible for our balance sheet. We envision being a center of excellence accessible to all Malaysians in terms of finance. We must be financially sustainable and profit is not our prime motive, as in the private healthcare sector. Our profits are reinvested into technology and human resources.</p><h4>How do you present yourself abroad to attract an international client base?</h4><p>The crux of it all is our quality, ensuring that we achieve clinical excellence. Without this we cannot move forward. This is our key philosophy. Meanwhile, we make considerable efforts to position ourselves as the heart center of choice in the region. We have a marketing department to collaborate with other partners and a representative office in Jakarta as Indonesia represents our largest foreign client base. We also target other regional markets like Bangladesh, Vietnam, and Myanmar. The Middle East is the next region that we will target. Another element that supports our value proposition is that we have trained many doctors from overseas, who after returning to their home countries become ambassadors for us. We grow by reputation and medical care is all about trust. Having references from friends and relatives is the most reliable and guaranteed method of marketing abroad. In Malaysia, we are leading the game if we compare ourselves to other regional players like Thailand and Singapore. The Malaysia Healthcare Travel Council (MHTC) is doing a great job in streamlining promotional efforts abroad. However, the responsibility also lies with individual hospitals, and, therefore, we have our own international agenda as well. The Middle East knows about our existence and our world-class healthcare, but there is much more work to do in terms of promotion. We have all the ingredients, but we could organize ourselves better to get the message out into the right forum. A successful system of medical tourism requires the efforts from all players in the ecosystem, and we work to do our part and develop our own branding strategy. Essentially, our value proposition is two-fold: quality and care, and competitive pricing.</p><h4>How do you plan to cater to growing patient demand?</h4><p>We have plans to develop two sub-clinics, one for private patients and one for public use. Our company will be split into two separate entities, a holding company that will remain responsible for the current facilities and IJN Private to run the new private hospital. We will still use all our assets, human resources, back office, research, and facilities for both our new entities. We saw a need to develop this private arm and have acquired neighboring land to materialize our extension project.</p><h4>Can you tell us how you can enhance the health of the nation with wellness programs as part of your preventative care initiatives? </h4><p>In recent years, we have been promoting ourselves not just as the place to go when one has health problems, but rather as proponents of heart healthcare. We indeed look more and more into preventative care activities and run several awareness campaigns that are also as part of our CSR agenda. We have a trailer equipped with echo clinical equipment, and every month we go to rural areas outside of Kuala Lumpur to provide medical check-ups. We have launched several media campaigns to promote a healthy lifestyle, for example to make people aware of the benefits of cycling. In partnership with Maybank Islamic, we organize cycling events and also provide the medical care for other cycling events. We are softening our image and reaching out to a larger circle of people. Our wellness center has also been well received. We provide medical screenings to those who are keen on staying informed about their condition. This is a great vehicle for us, not just in terms of business but in healthcare terms—we can detect diseases at an early stage, resulting in much higher levels of success. The wellness center is not where our margins lie; however, it introduces our high quality standards to our patients and demonstrates how our full-range of care is higher than private hospitals.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were some of the highlights in Mecca this year, both in terms of visitors for Hajj and Umrah, and also from an organizational perspective?</h4><p>As part of Vision 2030, it was announced that the Hajj and Umrah would become a source of economic generation in the country. One of the pillars of the Vision is to increase the number of visitors coming to Mecca up to 20 million by 2020, and to 30 million by 2030. The infrastructure in Mecca is prepared for such an increase in the number of visitors, especially after finishing the expansion project of Masjid Al-Haram, the Great Mosque. The roads, particularly the ring roads, have also been improved, and the Mecca-Madina high-speed rail is expected to be finished by the end of this year. This rail will be commissioning tests as of the first half of 2017, and will hopefully begin to transport people by the end of 2017. All these improvements are set to transform Mecca and we hope that these developments will come to pass. In addition to more than 20 four and five-star hotels, there are mega projects for housing, including the Jabal Omar complex which has just been completed. Also, another megaproject for real estate and housing has just begun, and the execution of metro, road, and infrastructure projects are underway.</p><h4>What is your outlook regarding the completion of major infrastructure projects in Mecca?</h4><p>Although there is a small chance of delay due to the financial crisis, there should not be any risks concerning the completion of these projects themselves. The projects will go well, especially the ones that need to be in service for the pilgrimage and visitors to Mecca and Madina. We expect a substantial increase in the numbers this year. Last year, we had about 12 million visitors, mostly in Umrah. The Hajj attracted about 2.3 million people in 2016, 1.3 million of whom were visitors from outside of Saudi Arabia. One of the megaprojects that we hope will be started in 2017 is the development of the “Mashair," (the areas for performance of the Hajj), especially Mina and Arafat, which will increase the capacity of the Hajj. The capacity in the “Mashair" is currently limited to less than 2 million people, but once we start this project, it is safe to say that it would accommodate about 4 million pilgrims every year.</p><h4>A big part of Vision 2030 is religious tourism. What would you also like to see from the governmental side in terms of easing the procedure for international visitors to Mecca?</h4><p>There is a regulation that has already eased the process for businessmen who travel to Saudi Arabia. It will be a multiple-entry visa lasting from one to three years. Vision 2030 will facilitate visa issuance to visitors. One of the pillars of the Vision is to increase non-oil income.</p><h4>You feel strongly about turning Mecca into a smart city, to work with innovation and renewable sources of energy. What is your reasoning for this?</h4><p>If we go through with the plans for making Mecca a smart city, it will first serve the visitors coming from the Islamic world, so they will know everything about the city, its hotels, and services. It will also act as a model for other cities in the Islamic World. We have made considerable progress regarding connectivity. As far as the internet and applications are concerned, there is a new company now established by Umm al-Qura University called “Wadi Makkah." This young company with innovative ideas is working on applications especially designed for Masjid al-Haram and Mina. For instance, there is an indoor navigation system of the Grand Mosque called AlMaqsad. At the moment, we are working on an application for parking lots in Mecca, and another one for city cleaning and smart systems to collect garbage and optimize the journey for collecting it. There is a trend in Saudi Arabia in terms of solar or renewable energy, since the central government has established a city called King Abdullah City for Atomic and Renewable Energy. They have a plan for developing sustainable sources of energy.</p><h4>In terms of short-term goals, what are your expectations for the year ahead, particularly with regard to organization and visitors?</h4><p>From an infrastructure point of view, we plan to at least double the number of visitors, particularly from outside of Saudi Arabia. In total we had 8 million pilgrims this year, and we hope to reach 15 million visitors for both Hajj and Umrah, but especially for Umrah. After about three years, we will be able to increase the number of Hajj visitors as well. We would like to double the figures for Umrah and increase the number of Hajj visitors from outside of Saudi Arabia to at least 2 million. Also, with the completion of the new King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah, with an annual capacity of 34 million, bringing visitors here should be much easier. There are more airlines coming,  visa issuance has just been made easier for visitors, businessmen, and tourists, especially from Islamic countries, and improved infrastructure in Mecca. All these together will serve to increase the number of visitors to Saudi Arabia.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>It is a great time for capital markets in Abu Dhabi. What is your vision for the development of the sector?</h4><p>2016 produced a year of unexpected political and economic shocks, which for many countries has led to uncertainty and worry.  The UK's decision to leave Europe, Donald Trump winning the US election, the continued low oil price, and dramatic changes to the value of key currencies has impacted financial markets. But the strong leadership and ambition of President H.H. Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, and the Crown Prince, H.H. Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, means Abu Dhabi is well placed to benefit from all these 'shocks.'  The diversification of the economy through the creation of a well-capitalized, credible world-class financial sector, has provided a vehicle for success and growth. At ADS Securities we are very grateful for the opportunity this has provided us and I believe that the best is yet to come. The global financial services industry has evolved significantly since ADS Securities was launched in 2010. Technology, regulation, and capitalization continue to shape the market in the near and medium term. Last year the Sterling flash crash also demonstrated the risks that technology, in inexperienced hands, can play in our industry. To me it showed that global markets may not yet be ready for highly sophisticated trading technology. If systems are not well-managed by professionals, who understand the industry, it can cause significant damage. In response to the introduction of new technology and products we are seeing a very necessary increase in the regulation. But in some markets this has become politically motivated which has made it restrictive and difficult for businesses to manage. Tighter regulation—including demands for higher capital requirements—has driven many well-known, established companies, out of business. The firms that have invested in managing regulation and expanded their compliance teams have stayed the course. Here in the region Abu Dhabi is a relatively new financial market which does not have legacy issues and accordingly we have been able to use regulation to support best practice and growth. ADS Securities has an advantage because regulatory measures and compliance are second nature to us. One of the major changes, driven by regulators, has been the requirement for higher capital adequacy levels. This has meant that many firms have had to become more risk averse, more conservative, and less accommodating to their clients. To access high quality liquidity financial institutions dealing with a range of asset classes, including foreign exchange, equities, and securities, you need to have the right capitalization measures in place. Our shareholders recently increased their capital investment in ADS Securities, deploying an additional USD185 million to increase our total capitalisation to USD585 million. This is a strong signal of their belief in both the enormous potential of our business and a clear opportunity for further differentiation in the industry.</p><h4>The downswing in oil prices prompted financial services to increase their market share. How has this effect worked in favor of financial companies such as ADS Securities?</h4><p>The visionary leadership of Abu Dhabi and the UAE prepared the country for the downturn in oil prices. Long before the drop in the oil prices occurred, they foresaw the need for economic diversification to guarantee the country's long-term interests. Before the downturn in oil prices thriving financial services and real estate sectors had already been established. The importance of this is also linked to the changes in the relative strength of the major currencies. The increase in the value of the dollar against, in particular Sterling, has created many business opportunities for Middle East investors and ADS Securities is ideally placed to facilitate these deals. In addition, companies across the GCC are looking for new business structures and financing options, which represents a great opportunity for players in the sector.</p><h4>Economic diversification has pushed an increasing number of companies to look for financial assistance. How has this positioned ADS as the partner of choice for financial services?</h4><p>ADS is one of the largest brokerage companies in the world and the consolidation of the UAE as a global financial hub has worked to our benefit. We have the largest capitalization among brokerage companies globally with USD585 million. This has allowed us to invest in people, technology, and the products we provide to our clients. We have the most advanced trading platforms, which is vital when markets are going through major moves and corrections. If you do not have the systems in place to price into volatile markets, your clients cannot trade. ADS has been able to cultivate a sense of confidence among our clients, so that they know their money is safe, their trades will be executed, and they are backed by advanced technology and state-of-the-art financial regulation.</p><h4>How has the ADS Arabic mobile trading app increased opportunities in the Middle East?</h4><p>The launch of OREX Mobile, the first-ever multi-asset smartphone trading application with full Arabic language functionality, represents a major investment for ADS Securities, and was designed to enhance the trading experience for professionals and private investors. The launch of OREX Mobile is the natural next step in the evolution of our brokerage business. It is a new way to access our high standard of service combined with market-leading prices and spreads—OREX puts the power of a desktop in traders' pockets to make the markets work for them anytime, anywhere. This is the first mobile trading application designed in the region, for the region, using state-of-the-art technology. It offers international pricing, products, and services, all tailored to the unique requirements of Middle East traders. OREX Mobile is a first in MENA and a major step forward in ensuring that Arabic language traders have access to the same tier 1 mobile trading technology available around the world.</p><h4>You have built a strong presence in the UK financial market. What are the main services you offer from London and how will the recent political events transform your operations in the country?</h4><p>London represents nearly 60% of the foreign exchange market, so as the Middle East's largest foreign exchange brokerage, it was essential that we had an operation in the UK. The commercial and business benefits have already validated this decision. In London, our operation is focused on serving our retail and institutional brokerage businesses, as well as services to the broader UK and European markets. Despite the UK referendum results earlier this year, my view is that London's status as a financial hub will remain untouched. In fact, if the UK looks to follow the Singapore 'free trade' model, moving away from the global trade restrictions the European Union places on its members, London may actually grow in importance.  The levels of liquidity managed by and going through the City means that even if the UK adopts the Swiss approach of concentrating on a single market area, it will still be a significant global player. This is ultimately a political decision and we will be eagerly watching how things evolve in the coming months.</p><h4>The Central Bank implemented a series of rules and laws during 2016. How would you assess these changes based on the evolution of financial markets here?</h4><p>I have always maintained that uncertainty in global financial centers has meant that emerging and developing markets have a greater role to play. The UAE has always been a business gateway for the GCC and this will continue to evolve as countries in the wider region look to expand their financial interests. Abu Dhabi's geographic location between East and West coupled with access to liquidity provides investors with access to the markets of the Middle East and provides for the investment of money from the region to overseas markets. The role of the Central Bank and the regulators has been key to creating and maintaining an efficient and high quality financial sector which can service the region as a whole. Attracting and retaining investment into the region will facilitate the creation of a greater range of products and services, ultimately expanding the financial services sector.  Looking specifically at this past year, the UAE Central Bank has been cautious yet intelligent in moving forward with regulations. Financial regulation is not a short-term play and the Central Bank has been prudent—they understand where financial markets are heading and have applied smart rules that will benefit the industry as a whole.</p><h4>What do you envision for the near future of the financial sector in Abu Dhabi and where will ADS fit into that future?</h4><p>Looking forward, ADS will continue to focus on our four core business lines—brokerage (online and offline), debt capital markets, investment banking, and asset and wealth management. Our brokerage business has always served as the 'engine' of our company, and we are continually identifying innovative ways to grow and develop. ADS' ability to leverage our strong relationships, robust capitalization, and global influence to reach out to bankers, brokers, and limited partnerships to ensure our clients benefit from the deepest liquidity, fastest execution times, and most competitive spreads to truly set us apart. The launch of our Prime of Prime offering earlier this year is filling a market gap in which leading brokerages like us have a role to go between clients and their own prime brokers and provide access and help to manage risk and share their credit lines. We also foresee growth for our debt capital markets business. With the low oil price and global tightening of liquidity, corporates will need to raise capital through debt structures. The secondary markets are very strong and stable—I think the UAE in particular is one of the most stable in the world. We will continue to help structure issuances and sell them. Finally, Abu Dhabi has emerged as the offshore wealth center of choice and we see massive opportunities for our asset and wealth management business—it has already seen immense growth in both our client base and in our Assets Under Management (AUM). We are able to offer our clients bespoke investment expertise, operational excellence that is transparent and discreet, as well as a real understanding of the risks and dynamics of the markets. Our asset and wealth management offering has not been developed for the mass market—we served targeted HNWIs and institutions, offering our clients a range of assets, products and services across international markets, as well as managing their personal wealth. We don't have the historical limitations of private banks or the product and service restrictions associated with international investment firms. So ultimately, our aim is not to compete with banks in the country or the region, but to add value and support to the market as a whole. The UAE has the connectivity, the resources, the infrastructure, time zone, and regulatory environment to provide any financial services professional with whatever service they need. Both Vision 2021 and Vision 2030 form a solid financial package in the long-run that will establish Abu Dhabi as one of the strongest financial services markets on the planet.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How are financial services horizontally integrated within the Kenanga Group? </h4><p>We are a financial group, our core businesses being equity broking, investment banking, listed derivatives, treasury, corporate advisory, Islamic banking, and asset and wealth management. Kenanga Investors Group is the asset management arm of Kenanga Investment Bank Berhad which consists of both conventional and Islamic entities. Kenanga is proud to be an award-winning Asset Management Company recognized for its investment performance and strong growth in recent years. We are one of only eight licensed Private Retirement Scheme (PRS) providers in Malaysia. We serve multi-segment investors from retail, corporate, institutional, and high-net worth individuals via a multi-distribution network. Our commitment to our clients drives us to perform consistently well in our business. We were previously predominantly known as an institutional player, managing pension funds, Malaysian GLCs, and large corporate clients. In more recent times, we have diversified our strategies to include mass retail markets through multi-distribution channels. Over the past few years, our company has recorded our consistent track records, solid investment strategies, and good risk governance for a more balanced value proposition for our clients. Moving ahead, we plan to further grow our clientele in the affluent to high-net worth segment of the market. In international standards, this includes individuals with assets ranging between USD100,000 and USD1 million. With the growing economy of Malaysia, there is also an increase in the segment of working and educated professionals with disposable income. We have initiated our private wealth arm to focus specifically on this segment market to provide financial advisory to meet their investment needs and accelerate their wealth accumulation.</p><h4>How do you position Malaysia within the larger ASEAN region?</h4><p>Our current strategy and strength is primarily for the Malaysian market. However, we do have a growing clientele across ASEAN, but our investment focus has been on Malaysia, therefore we build strategic alliances with our counterparts in other investment destinations. In today's volatile and highly specialized markets it is much more efficient to work in this manner than to set up offices abroad. This strategy has led to much better results for us. For example, Kazakhstan, a country that would normally look to London or Dubai as their financial hub could now consider Malaysia as we are geographically and culturally closer. In practical terms, companies in the same time zone as their investors would have additional benefits; from Malaysia we are able to work with the Singaporean, Japanese, Chinese, and Hong Kong markets with ease. The global investment world is not yet entirely borderless; working with specialized boutique investment mangers with on-the-ground knowledge reaps more benefits. We are a homegrown Malaysian investment firm with more than 40 years of experience, serving many international investors looking for a Malaysian strategy.</p><h4>How did Kenanga become the investor of choice for Malaysian GLCs and institutional investors?</h4><p>This is mainly due to concerted efforts across the group and to being focused through our strategy on delivering consistent performance and remaining true to our investment objectives and having a vibrant investment team. Also on the governance side, our investment risk management consists of a highly-skilled team that monitors all the parameters in the Malaysian standards whilst adopting international standards and best practices into our system. Investors prefer this long-term vision and sustainable performance as it fits their investment appetite. For three-, five-, and 10-year mutual funds, we have consistently been recognized as the top equity manager in Malaysia. For the past two years we have been building our expertise and track record for regional equities such as Asia Pac, ASEAN, and fixed income (sukuk and conventional), which will continue to open new avenues and unlock funds among institutional and private investors in both the conventional and Muslim world.</p><h4>Do you seek to integrate Islamic products into your core business?</h4><p>Our Islamic products are now focused on equities and fixed income funds whilst we believe there will be further growth in this area. There is a global Islamic wealth pool of around USD11-12 trillion that could be unlocked in the years ahead. Currently, there are fundamental sukuk or equity products in the market but with more convergence and standardization of sharia interpretation, streamlining, and structuring of the industry. We can expect to see more innovative Islamic products in the market. The format is now more globally recognized, which gives confidence and also the opportunity to benchmark and index funds. With the current low interest rate environment and the relative volatility of the market, investors have been looking for more yield product. More and more strategies are coming from Europe and the US, with new sustainable products, reflected in the popularity of environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) amongst investors. Both ESG, or socially responsible investing (SRI), and Islamic finance have similarities as they are based on ethical values. The 2008 crisis also raised more awareness of the Islamic financing model, as it is based on real assets and leaves less room for speculation.</p><h4>Why has Islamic finance gained so much traction in Malaysia?</h4><p>Firstly, the Government's concerted and ongoing efforts to build a sustainable Islamic finance framework. Various complementing policies and incentives have been given to drive and promote and deepen the industry. All round efforts to create awareness about Islamic Banking and sharia-compliant products and understanding the differences between Conventional Banking &amp; Islamic Banking. Better understanding of Islamic finance and investing has also been a contributing factor. The requirements on capital adequacy for financial institutions in meeting Basel requirements, may have resulted in more stringent loans approvals, but an Islamic structure generally requires debts to be backed by securities and/or solid assets. When taking an Islamic debt, companies may pledge actual assets; therefore, if the client defaults, it defaults on the asset—it is a matter of risk sharing. Also, the system generally is based on profit sharing as there is no guarantee of interest. It reduces the upfront costs involved, which does not necessarily make it cheaper but reduces the overall costs based on the performance of the underlying assets. One needs to understand and study the asset-based sharia products and learn how to market the products efficiently to customers. The wave of change, with the direction of funds flowing from the Middle East, is moving east rather than west, and has also created more interest in Islamic finance. The Middle East, as well as other Islamic countries is now increasingly looking at Islamic investment opportunities. In Malaysia, there has been a commendable effort from the government over the years to build up the financial infrastructure and a value chain where all stakeholders are sharia-compliant. Realistically, it takes time to build a new industry, and the announcement by the largest pension fund, the Employee Provident Fund (EPF), to start a 100% Islamic fund of MYR100 billion, will continue to spur the segment. It reflects continuing government interest in establishing Islamic finance. We will continue to support and build strong and independent leadership in managing Islamic banking and financial institutions.</p><h4>Does Kenanga plan to consolidate its strong relations with the institutional investors to build the retirement industry? </h4><p>We believe the retirement industry will spin off into other industries namely food and beverage, pharmaceuticals, healthcare, and hospitality—with IT advancing into all these sectors as well. As a country, we need to focus on developing our infrastructure for greater inclusivity and to educate Malaysians to become more financially literate. For the continuous development of our retirement industry, all stakeholders from both the government and private sectors must be committed to drive sustainable retirement planning at all stages. As an extra factor, Malaysia has great conditions for retirement: great weather, an amazing variety of food, well-organized healthcare, affordable costs of living, relative safety from natural disasters, and a rather central location in Asia Pacific. As most Malaysians speak English, we also have a great competitive advantage over others in the region. Retirement investment solutions are key drivers for our business. Our approach has been a “no-one-size-fits-all" model resulting in understanding differing investment objectives that require tailored solutions where we carefully consider clients' risk appetites, risk tolerance, and investment schedules. This also requires us to have stringent risk management models with a three-line defense built into our process involving fund managers, compliance, and risk management. Together with our investment strategy to become a consistent performer and drive sustainability, moving into the retirement industry fits our strategy well for the years ahead. True to our mantra, we will use agility, collaboration, and trustworthiness to bring Malaysia to your doorstep.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you tell us about your new slogan and what strategies you are using to promote Tanzania as a global destination?</h4><p>The slogan has been changing in the past decade, from “Tanzania, unsurpassed Africa!" to “Authentic Africa" and “Tanzania, The Land of Kilimanjaro, Zanzibar, and the Serengeti." This worked very well for us because we were naming our three national icons. In 2015 we decided to change the slogan to show the world exactly what Tanzania was about. When we refer to a soul, it means life; something that lives on, that gives life to a body and is endless or believed to live forever. Home to the highest mountain in Africa, Mt. Kilimanjaro; the Ngorongoro Crater, the Eden of Africa, and the eighth wonder of the world; Lake Victoria, the source of the Nile; Selous, the largest game reserve in Africa; Lake Tanganyika, the deepest and longest lake in Africa; and the fact that the remains of the world's oldest living man were found here makes “The Soul of Africa" the most fitting refrain.</p><h4>How are you cooperating with the private sector to reach the minister's stated goal of 3 million tourists by 2018?</h4><p>Together with the private sector, we developed an international marketing strategy in 2012 to set goals, decide how to reach them, and determine which particular markets we should concentrate our efforts upon. The primary markets we selected were the US, the UK, Germany, and Italy, and the secondary markets were Canada, France, Australia, the Netherlands, and Spain. That said, we are also very interested in the BRICS, the UAE, and of course Africa as a region. We are also trying to diversify our tourism offerings, such as holding more conferences, and have developed state-of-the-art conference facilities in Dar es Salaam in order to attract more MICE tourism. Our new National Stadium in Dar es Salaam also draws hundreds of sports events to Tanzania, and key international marathons such as Kilimanjaro, Ngorongoro, and Rock City attract athletics from all over the world. For cultural events we have the film festival in Zanzibar (ZIFF) as well as a cultural festivals such as Sauti Za Busara and Haydom, to mention a few. In addition, we recently launched the Swahili International Tourism Expo, Tanzania's leading tourism event, which features a comprehensive hosted buyer program and attracts hundreds of exhibitors and trade visitors. All of these events draw thousands of tourists to Tanzania. Cultural tourism is also a popular trend, as tourists want to experience local life and participate in daily economic activities. </p><h4>What opportunities do you see for private investors, local or foreign, in the tourism sector?</h4><p>Right now, there are many opportunities, for both local and foreign investors. These include investments in accommodation facilities such as lodges and hotels and entertainment facilities such as marine parks, conventional centers, casinos, recreational facilities, sports facilities, transport, restaurants, and casinos.</p><h4>What are the challenges preventing this sector from faster and bigger growth?</h4><p>There are many challenges, starting with local regional competition. Kenya and South Africa, which have similar products, are prime examples. Another challenge is our existing infrastructure and the fact that some areas of the country are not easily accessible during the rainy season. In addition to the question of connectivity, there is also the political instability and security issues of the East African region, not to mention the quality of service delivery.</p><h4>Do you have any specific goals or expectations for 2017?</h4><p>Our target for the next three years is to reach 2 million visitors. With the completion of the new airport terminal, more international airlines will start coming to Tanzania, meaning more passengers and more tourists. The government is making efforts to open up the southern circuit. By doing so, we will get more tourists interested in visiting that part of the country. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The government increased the ministry's budget in recognition of its economic importance. What are your priorities for these funds?</h4><p>We are responsible for forestry, wildlife, tourism, and national heritage so our investments will clearly go into these areas. In the forestry sector, we will invest more in tree planting in new extension areas, the protection of existing forestry resources for water catchments, and the creation of new nature reserves to ensure the total conservation of areas with exceptional flora and fauna. In the wildlife sector, our main investments will go into anti-poaching efforts and expanding our tourism infrastructure.</p><h4>What is the new administration's position on coordinating with international institutions to help reduce and prevent poaching?</h4><p>Our policy is three-pronged. The first is coordinating with the international community, because if there is no demand for ivory in the world poaching will cease. At the regional level, we are cooperating with our neighbors that also have elephants and coordinating with them so that we can apprehend poachers together. At the domestic level, we have a monitoring system in place now so that we can immediately respond to instances of poaching. Secondly, we are arresting not only the people who shoot the elephants, but also the ones who cut off the tusks, transport the ivory, sell to the middlemen in the big cities, and export to countries like Vietnam.</p><h4>What is your opinion on applying VAT to tourism services in Tanzania?</h4><p>In 2007, we pushed strongly to develop the tourism industry, finally enacting the Tourism Act in 2009. One of the first actions we took under that legislation was to allow tourism services companies to operate in a tax-free environment to help them grow. We envisaged that they would need this assistance for around five to six years. In 2015, we realized that the time had come for the tourism sector to pay its share of tax like all other sectors. By that time, tourism had grown to 17% of GDP and Tanzania was earning 25% of its foreign currency from tourism. We cannot have a small farmer paying taxes and huge business with a turnover of millions not paying its share. The second point is that Tanzania is moving away from its dependency on donor support, which is now down to 18% from about 54% when I was first a minister in 2006.</p><h4>How do you see tourism flows evolving in Tanzania?</h4><p>The biggest shift will be to diversify our tourism products from Serengeti National Park, Ngorongoro, and trekking Kilimanjaro to include going to the beach afterwards. We have the best beaches on the East African coast; for example, Pemba Island. We are talking to investors to create land for tourism near Dar es Salaam and another project to build a big marina in the South of Kilwa. One of the biggest problems we have had so far in trying to grow tourism in the west and south of the country is that people usually have to travel to these areas by small 12- to 15-seater aircraft and the airfares are high. However, from October 2016, with the arrival of new Air Tanzania aircraft tourists will be able to travel on regular flights to Kigoma. Then, on to Dar es Salaam for USD150 instead of having to pay USD1,600 for chartered flights.</p><h4>How are you responding to the threat of the climate change to make the tourism sector sustainable in the long term?</h4><p>There have been many changes and when a country bases its economy on nature and the ecosystem it has to take this seriously into account. In the past, we used to think about wildlife and national parks as ecosystems we should leave to take their own course. Now we cannot; we have to respond to the new challenges. We will lose all the wildlife within 20 to 30 years if we take a laissez-faire approach. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Aga Khan is a major healthcare player around the world and in the region. What is the importance of East Africa to your overall operations?</h4><p>The Aga Khan Development Network operates 15 hospitals around the world and more than 300 other healthcare facilities, so it is quite a large network. We see almost 5 million patients. Three of our hospitals, in Karachi, Nairobi, and Dar es Salam, are not only teaching hospitals but also Joint Commission certified hospitals, the highest level of quality in patient safety a healthcare facility can have. The other health facilities, which we call primary medical centers, are all connected in our hub and support model. Looking at East Africa, there are 70 healthcare facilities in addition to the four hospitals that we have. The objective is to provide access by partnering with the public center and improve it by having a robust patient welfare program.</p><h4>How do you fit into the health matrix in Tanzania?</h4><p>Within Tanzania we have the Aga Khan hospital, which is a tertiary level hospital with a major and underway expansion plan, which will see the hospital expand to a 170-bed tertiary and academic medical center by 2018. We are already tertiary in some sense and academic in some sense; however, the current in-patient capacity limits us from expanding in those areas. It is a USD80 million expansion project, and the purpose is to create the scale that will allow us to train more physicians and nursing leaders and provide tertiary level medical care. In addition to the hospital, we have 14 other healthcare facilities in Tanzania and will have 35 by 2019. We are opening an outreach health facility every two months so it is quite an aggressive plan. However it is not only about opening facilities but about programmatically linking the same with the hospital and our other centers to create a continuum of care.   </p><h4>What is your cost management procedure in a market that does not have a great deal of purchasing power but a great need for healthcare?</h4><p>Affordability is a huge challenge, as majority of the Tanzanians are unable to pay for health care services.  Within our system we manage to do the best by firstly haveinga robust patient welfare program with contributions coming from corporate donors, individuals, as well as from the hospital that contributes from its revenue lines. We have also been fairly successful in implementing the concept of differential pricing and cross subsidization. If a pregnant woman comes to this hospital in Dar es Salam then for example delivery would be say between USD400- 500 however if she went to our centers in Mwanza or Mbeya, the delivery cost is only USD70, so a portion of the cost that is paid in Dar es Salaam goes to subsidizing care in those centers. If a patient goes to an outreach center in Masaki, which is an affluent area he or she would probably pay USD20 for a consultant, but if they go to Tandika, which is a disadvantaged area, patients would pay USD1.5, and hence the principle of differential pricing and cost subsidization. This allows us to provide the same level of care irrespective of the affordability status of the community.   </p><h4>What do you see as barriers to the areas for improvement?</h4><p>Unless there is a financing structure that pays for healthcare  at the appropriate level, it will be always be a challenge as affordability is very low. The second area is human resources for health. While there are good medical schools that graduated about 1,000-1,200 doctors each year. The third area is making the whole process of obtaining  approvals for various activities one stop and much quicker. als. To open a clinic takes six months. It has to move much quicker, and the Ministry of Health is focused on that. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What approach have you seen from the new government to address the housing shortage, and what strategy does the NHC have in place to support the housing needs of low-income families?</h4><p>Addressing the housing shortage has been part of the ruling party's manifesto for the last 10 years and this agenda includes guidance about what the NHC is supposed to do in this area. The new president, John Magufuli, was the former Minister of Road Works, so we have a president who understands the issues of construction and infrastructure well. Many people do not have the purchasing power to buy a house even if we think we are building affordable housing. At the same time, we cannot provide a house for every citizen in the country. In terms of what we are doing, NHC houses are affordable. There is no government-owned or private company in Sub-Saharan Africa selling cheaper houses than us. Our lowest-priced house, which is a two-bedroom, 56sqm house in a good neighborhood, is USD14,500, including the title, land, and all of the infrastructure. I am extremely proud of this, but still not everyone can afford it. Therefore, we need to be far more creative and see what opportunities there are to reduce the price to USD10,000.</p><h4>The gap between housing supply and demand is still increasing. How would you assess the current opportunities for investors in this sector?</h4><p>It represents a huge opportunity for investors. However, it is not just a business to make a profit out of; it is a social endeavor as well. There are many disadvantaged families and children without decent housing and when I look at how we can approach and respond to this challenge I do not see it as the NHC's issue alone. NHC is one of the stakeholders, but we cannot do it alone. We have been opening doors in a bid to attract investors to come and work with the NHC. Housing is not just bricks and mortar; it is a finance game. Therefore, the government has to set proper monetary, fiscal, and other policies to attract foreign investors who come in as developers, pure investors, or buyers of properties. At the end of the day, it is the local people who lose out if this is not handled properly.</p><h4>What can the NHC offer to private foreign investors?</h4><p>One advantage the NHC can offer is its experience. NHC was the first company started by the government. Secondly, we have a good skill base, including engineers, technicians, architects, quality surveyors, and other professionals related to the construction sector. Thirdly, the NHC is an institution that has a good balance sheet of more than USD1.6 billion, along with a professional structure. The institutional formula of this corporation works well both for local and foreign investors. The fourth advantage we offer is the most prime areas in the country for development projects.</p><h4>What are your five-year plans and specific goals for 2017 at the NHC?</h4><p>The only thing that has changed is the targets. With the new government, some exciting opportunities are coming up. For example, the new government is moving the capital to Dodoma, a huge opportunity for real estate. There will be huge demand for development in Dodoma both in residential and office blocks. This government is also pushing for industrialization and this along with the construction of satellite cities and the relocation of the capital to Dodoma will boost the building materials sector. It is an exciting time. We have launched many projects and our main focus for 2016-2017 is to complete those and embark on developing Dodoma. The government is keen to start moving there in 2016. We will also continue to develop the satellite cities we have started. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What characteristics differentiate Tanga Cement in such a competitive sector?</h4><p>The quality of our products is a key differentiator, but so is their sustainability. Our product is consistent across the market. We do not believe in being good one day and bad the next. We have invested in this country and in this company, spending money on equipment that will sustain our presence here for generations. We are definitely the greenest player and there are various ways to measure it; for example, the amount of CO2 produced per ton of cement or the saving we make by implementing technology. We have established bag filters in our new plant, which are designed to European standards. When the new plant was completed it will follow the same rules and standards, with low electricity consumption, low water consumption, and zero emissions.</p><h4>Are you thinking of expanding to other countries in the region?</h4><p>Afrisam is a South African-based company, so we form part of the group and represent its African expansion strategy. Tanga Cement as a company does not currently have any ambitions to expand into other countries except via market penetration through sales.</p><h4>What is your in-country shipping and logistics strategy?</h4><p>There is no better way to transport cement than by rail. We are blessed by the fact that we are the only cement plant with a rail line right into our factory; therefore, we load directly onto the rail track. Then, we also have depots from which we can offload directly from the tracks again. We never required an intermediate step between the plant and the rail line, which makes us one of the most efficient players in the market. Yes, there is room for improvement as far as rail operations go but we want to be part of optimizing that together with TRL, which is why we have signed an agreement with it.</p><h4>What are the main challenges Tanga Cement faces?</h4><p>Our top three challenges are price, taxation, and newcomers. We are in an extremely competitive environment and Tanzania is one of the few countries that for the past 10 years has been able to achieve consistent growth. This attracted other players to the market, which has put pressure on prices. Some importers have brought a large amount cement in through the ports, and unfortunately there are many illegal imports as well.</p><h4>What opportunities are there with the new government-led drive for sustainable long-term development? </h4><p>The opportunities lay in the optimization of our footprint, cost structures, and production capacities. At the same time, one has to realize that if they construct a cement plant properly, sticking to the safety standards, financial rules, permits, access to raw materials and so on, it takes at least two years to construct. So in the short-term, for a new investor considering constructing a totally new integrated plant, the opportunities are small, because they need a huge balance sheet to foot this bill.</p><h4>What are your goals for the near future?</h4><p>We have implemented a rigorous optimization and efficiency drive within the company, which started in roughly mid-2015. The results for the first half of 2016 were a 55% increase in net profit. The future will continue in this vein because of what we have done and how we have done it. One thing we are happy about is the successful conclusion of our expansion project, which makes us completely independent of any raw material importation. We are self-sufficient in the supply of clinker and can now produce all that is required by the country by using only locally produced goods. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The government wants to revive Air Tanzania and a three-phase plan has been decided on. Could you share the details and status of this plan?</h4><p>We are concentrating in the first phase, which is the domestic market. It will take maybe two to three years before we move on to the second phase, which will look beyond Tanzania to the nearby markets of Kenya, Uganda, Burundi, Rwanda, the DRC, and Zambia. The third phase is to have intercontinental flights beyond our region. The idea is step-by-step growth to eventually compete with other global players. This is a high-level plan that must be structured with specific milestones to move from one phase to the next. For Phase I, we have acquired two new aircraft from the government and the next move will be to consolidate our position in the domestic market. We have several competitors within the domestic market, and there is a stiff competition here. There are two other airlines operating alongside us, Precision Air and FastJet, a low-cost carrier. The idea is to establish our position as the dominant airline in the domestic market. We have our own business strategies, with a customer-oriented focus, to position Air Tanzania in the market.</p><h4>What strategies do you have to make Air Tanzania profitable and what are the major challenges here?</h4><p>For a long time we were operating purely as a social service provided by the government. Hence the company was not concerned with its financial position, and profits and losses were not an issue for anyone. Now, we are moving away from that mentality and will operate as a commercial entity. We have to understand the challenges faced by our competitors and have to also make ourselves more competitive from a human resources point of view. We will work as a commercial entity and make sure that whatever we spend on has a reason. Ideally, what I want is a complete cultural change and to move away from being an organization that does not look at financial statements to one that is primarily concerned with results and the outlook of its financial statements. </p><h4>How can Air Tanzania contribute to this country?</h4><p>First, we have to look at the nature of air transport, which is a facilitative sector. It cuts travel time and makes it easier to reach remote and otherwise difficult to access locations; much more than that, air travel opens potential. Tanzania is a vast country with a great deal of potential; therefore, air transport, especially Air Tanzania, has a role to play in facilitating business opportunities. Our role is to establish connections between those places that have economic potential available to the wider economy at an agreeable cost.</p><h4>The government has already allocated TZS100 billion to construct airports across the country. How will this impact the future of the aviation sector?</h4><p>The aviation sector in Tanzania has been growing, registering extremely strong growth of between 10 and 15% per annum. Tanzania is moving from a low-income economy to a middle-income one and consequently I expect growth to increase to 15-20% a year. Infrastructure is crucial for this. If we have aircraft but do not have anywhere to land, then it is useless, which is why the government has invested in building the necessary infrastructure for us to make sure that we can reach all parts of the country.</p><h4>What are your goals and expectations for 2017?</h4><p>Frankly speaking, Air Tanzania was in the midst of a crisis and my first objective is to turn around the airline. I have given myself until June 2017 to stabilize this and to make sure we get out of this hole. 2017 will be a crucial moment; it will be the start of the new Air Tanzania as far as operations are concerned. We will then start competing as an airline, moving from the ICU and seeing the light for the first time.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[prepare-the-runway]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us a sense of the scale of Tanzania's aviation industry?</h4><p>As the airport authority, we manage about 58 airports across the country and, according to the National Transport Policy, we are supposed to have an airport in each region of the country. Some are small airstrips but they have flights going on. As activities expand we have to upgrade the airports that we have today into big airports to meet current demand. We need to develop runways, terminal buildings, and also provide infrastructure for safety such as fire trucks and runway lights. We expect to be audited by the civil aviation regulator and again by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to ensure we are compliant. The capital will shift to Dodoma; therefore, we will build an airport that meets the requirements of the region. That means building capacity for international flights to come to Dodoma after the government has constituted its activities there. In terms of income for the authority, the largest portion of our income comes from one airport, Julius Nyerere, which contributes  over 80% of the total income. Much of the income that comes from there will support the development of other airports' infrastructure.</p><h4>What other investments are being considered? </h4><p>Terminal 3 is being constructed now, and by November 2017 it will be open. There are many opportunities, especially in airport hotels and other businesses. We have many requests for investments in airport hotels and many of these requests come to Julius Nyerere. There are a number of hotels coming that want to catch that market because they know that demand will be huge when we complete Terminal 3. There are some airlines that depart at night and passengers will want to be next to the airport to avoid traffic, and this is something that we need to catch up on very quickly and advertise for those who want to come and invest. Not only at Julius Nyerere, but we also have other airports, such as Mwanza, where we have land that could be developed. In Arusha, the airport for general aviation is congested with small flights. Many tourists use it to fly into Arusha to take further transport to the national parks, which is why we seek investors to cater to this market.</p><h4>What changes do you expect to take place under the new government?</h4><p>The government has decided to allocate a good amount of money to improve airport infrastructure. We have a project in Shinyanga beginning shortly with a terminal building, runway, taxiway, and apron. We also have Sumbawanga and projects in Tabora and Kigoma beginning soon with the same infrastructure of runway, taxiway, and apron. There are another 11 airports where the feasibility studies are still in progress and once completed the government will start sourcing funds and then it will take off. In Mwanza we had a project for a cargo terminal, cargo apron, and an extension of the runway to 3.5km from 3km. Mwanza is the second-largest airport under the Tanzania Airports Authority. There is another airport where construction has started called Chato airport, which is in the region of Geita. The construction of the runway has started and is a new airport in a greenfield location.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>Looking ahead, in terms of business we expect progress on the economic side, which affects businesses other than the airport. The country's economy is progressing well and these indications also improve the airport business. When there is improvement in the tourism sector, it also positively affects growth in the aviation sector. Therefore, when there are positive indications in the economy, agriculture, and tourism sectors I expect investment and positive growth in the coming 12 months. We expect to grow beyond the ministry's target of 20% in revenues this year. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the new government's approach to developing maritime transport in Tanzania?</h4><p>The government is taking a comprehensive view and looking at multiple projects. However, a port is only as good as the transport corridor it is part of. We can have the most efficient port in the world, but it will be ineffectual if it is not supported by good road and hinterland connections. This is particularly true for a country like Tanzania that also deals with a great deal of transit cargo for neighboring landlocked countries. The intention is there and visible in the discussions the Tanzania Ports Authority (TPA) is having with The World Bank to obtain additional financing to improve and modernize not only the port, but the connections to it. They want whatever allows the transportation corridor to work efficiently and their goods to move at a reasonable price with predictable timing and security to their intended destination.</p><h4>What differentiates the berths operated by the TPA versus TICTS at Dar es Salaam Port and how do you cooperate with TPA to ensure that the country benefits?</h4><p>The TPA operates berths one through seven and TICTS has berths eight to 11 at the port. TPA handles many different types of cargo, including containers, general cargo, bulk, ro-ro, and everything else. TICTS is a container terminal and our focus is on handling containers and related services, such as storage. Our lease agreement is for berths eight to 11 and we still have another nine years left on our concession, which has already been extended once. We work together with the TPA on many different initiatives and activities. We are doing plenty of joint marketing on the land trade corridor from Dar es Salaam to the landlocked countries in the region.</p><h4>What is the level of investment made by TICTS in Tanzania so far?</h4><p>In terms of our investments in Dar es Salaam Port over the last 15 years, we have made USD106 million in capital investments between 2001 and 2015. The two new quay cranes represent another USD20 plus million. This means close to USD130 million in total investment by TICTS at Dar es Salaam Port. We have paid over USD152 million in royalties and lease payments to the TPA. We have collected USD382 million in wharfage that is passed on to the TPA and paid more than USD84 million in corporate taxes since 2001.</p><h4>How do you cooperate with other stakeholders to build an efficient multimodal logistics network to serve the region?</h4><p>There have been a number of improvements, especially in the Dar es Salaam-Rwanda corridor. There used to be more than a dozen checkpoints along that route and now there are only three. We are working to make that corridor more competitive; for example, we want to add a regional bank with branches in all these countries to facilitate payments. This would cut down on bank transfer fees and time delays. We are working with the Shipping Association, the Freight Forwarders Association, the shipping lines, and the TPA to look at how we can make the transport chain more competitive.</p><h4>What specific goals and expectations does TICTS have for 2017?</h4><p>We have been doing our budgets and forecasts for 2017 and expect the year to be a bit flat at best. Overall, in terms of trends, in 2014-2015 container traffic in sub-Saharan Africa declined more than in most other regions of the world. Most of this is because of commodities, particularly in China, not buying as much from the region. The traffic mix is different; we have much more transshipment now and more empties. Therefore, the actual imports-exports, which are the most profitable part of the business, are less in terms of the total mix of traffic. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Long-term development can only be achieved through a modern and interconnected network of infrastructure. What is the government's approach to tackling this issue?</h4><p>Infrastructure is an important asset for any country. There is no development or economic progress without the proper infrastructure to support it. In 2016, the government decided it wanted to build a network of state of the art infrastructure for Tanzania to become a middle-income country by 2025. Our mission at the Ministry of Works, Transport and Communication (MoW) is to build this state-of-the-art infrastructure for town roads, ports, and aviation. To this end, in 2016 the government allocated TZS2.496 trillion to transport projects in the country. Some of this will go toward the building of a standard gauge railway from Dar es Salaam to Dodoma, Tabora, Isaka, and on to Mwanza, around 1,219km of track. We also want to connect from Isaka to Musoma so trains can go to Kigali in Rwanda, which involves another 361km of track. Furthermore, we want to connect Tabora to Kigoma to transport goods on to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The railway network that we will build will have a total of 2,506km of track. Phase I will include 1,219km of track and phases II-IV will follow over time.</p><h4>What are the government's plans for new marine and port infrastructure projects?</h4><p>In terms of marine transport, this is important for northern Tanzania, where we have Lake Victoria, Lake Tanganyika, and Lake Eyasi; hence, we need to develop our marine sector. In 2016, we put out a tender for a new ship to be built for use on Lake Victoria. We invited overseas companies to tender for this work. The ship will be for 1,200 passengers plus 400 tons of cargo. We also want to repair all our existing vessels on both Lake Victoria and Lake Tanganyika. In terms of maritime port infrastructure, starting with the Port of Dar es Salaam, this is important to the economy of Tanzania and our neighboring countries. Rwanda, Burundi, Malawi, and Zambia all use the Port of Dar es Salaam because it is safe; it provides a service to five landlocked countries that depend on Tanzania's ports for access to the sea. We want to make the Port of Dar es Salaam a logistics hub for East African countries. Not only that, we also want to have proper connections and state-of-the-art equipment to fulfill the requirements of a logistics hub for the region. For Tanzania, this port is the heart of our economy; therefore, in 2016 the government plans to spend USD250 million through the Port of Dar es Salaam for infrastructure works there. At the same time we are in negotiations with The World Bank for funding to further develop the Port of Dar es Salaam. We expect to get a contribution of USD600 million. The first priority is to increase the depth of the port and we also want to widen the entrance.</p><h4>What is your strategy for supporting the development of the telecoms infrastructure?</h4><p>Telecommunications is important for any country. If a country wants to work effectively and efficiently it needs a proper ICT system. The government of Tanzania has invested around USD200 million in building the national ICT backbone infrastructure. Every region and district of Tanzania has been connected to the national ICT backbone and Tanzania has 24,000km of fiber-optic cables, most of which was the result of PPPs, and 3G is accessible in many parts of the country. That technology can be used to alleviate the poverty problem in this country and is ultimately the only way we can minimize the gap between our urban and rural population. To this end we are investing in young entrepreneurs. For example, in 2014 we developed the Dar es Salaam incubator to foster entrepreneurship to ensure that these young innovators are part of the development of Tanzania. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>According to a new regulation, telecoms companies will have to list 25% of their shares on the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange (DSE) by the end of 2016. What is your opinion of this measure and what opportunities does it create for investors?</h4><p>This is a good measure and will create different opportunities for investors. There are two key opportunities for us here: first, Halotel will have the ability to raise a great deal of capital that can be used for further investments in the telecom industry. The second is the advantage to gain more experience, especially in the telecoms industry, and use it to improve our performance, for example in distribution channels, in particular in rural and remote areas. Building up infrastructure will ensure that the quality of the network remains great all the time. In addition, Halotel will be able to learn more about the Tanzanian business environment and gain awareness in marketing and advertising. Our aim is to bring a true telecommunications network and greater benefits to Tanzania.</p><h4>Penetration of telecoms services in Tanzania is still quite low. What is your assessment of unexploited opportunities for the private sector in the telecoms sector?</h4><p>Market opportunities are plenty and divided equally among telecom operators. The penetration rate of mobile subscribers in the rural areas is extremely low, standing at 37%. About 70% of the population is distributed in rural areas, so this is an incredible set of potential customers. The challenge that telecoms providers have to face is an adequate return on investment for each base transmission station (BTS) as the rural population is unevenly distributed and each village is far from one another, more than dozens or even hundreds of kilometers away. Therefore the revenues are not enough to offset the cost of investment and operation. Halotel aims to become a true network for Tanzania. Before Halotel invested in the Tanzanian telecoms market, the penetration of mobile services was at extremely low levels: only 37%. There were many remote areas that had not been connected before and prices were high. The quality of internet was poor. With investment experience in other markets, Halotel aims to bring to Tanzania a true mobile network with extensive coverage at the most reasonable prices. At the same time, when several operators enter the market, the level of competition is pushed higher. If telecoms providers want to compete, they must invest more to increase the quality of service and provide the most reasonable price. Therefore, our customers are the ones who have benefited the most. In the short term, Halotel continues to invest more to increase coverage up to 95% of the population. At the same time, at the beginning of next year, Halotel will cover 1,000 villages that had no telecom services, bringing the total number of villages that have a mobile signal for the first-time ever up to 4,000.</p><h4>What are your goals and expectations for Halotel in 2017?</h4><p>Halotel plans to cover 95% of the Tanzanian population countrywide before the end of 2016 and to provide 4G services in 2017. The company will deploy services and invest in more than 1,000 villages that had no telecom services before at the beginning of 2017. We will also deploy fiber optic everywhere in the country and make Tanzania the top country in Africa to use the network with fiber optic infrastructure. Based on fiber optic cable, Halotel will make information technology become popular in all areas of social life and will support the development of an electronic system for the Tanzanian government, for example, video conferencing and other ICT solutions to facilitate the government in its management and daily tasks. Halotel's target is to increase the number of subscribers to 7 million before the end of 2017, and to have 3 million subscribers using the Halopesa service before the end of 2017. At the same time, we always consider social responsibilities alongside this development. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of the government's acquisition of TTCL, and what will be the impact moving forward?</h4><p>The government taking back a 35% share reflects the idea of Tanzania moving toward being a middle-income country. The government strategically made the decision to own it in the sense that it wants to have a larger part in the telecommunications sector. This is motivated by the fact that once Tanzania has stronger infrastructure and connects more people then it will be easy for the country to graduate to a middle income economy status. We also plan to be an industrial nation as well; therefore, it is of paramount importance for TTCL to be a true government entity.</p><h4>What potential do you see in the mobile money services business and what is your strategy for converting that?</h4><p>We see potential because Tanzania has more mobile users than any country in East Africa and therefore there is the potential for TTCL to venture into mobile banking services. We are sure that by positioning ourselves as one of the biggest telecoms operators we will definitely benefit, firstly as a government entity, but also as a profit-making organization. At the moment, TTCL's 4G LTE network coverage is limited to Dar Es Salaam; therefore, we plan by the end of this year to be able to cover another three regions: Dodoma, Mwanza, and Arusha. Dodoma is the capital, Mwanza is a business hub, and Arusha is a tourist destination. Our strategy is to move to those three regions and from there grow into the other regions, with the aim of covering the whole country with our 4G network by 2017.  The support we have from the government will help us achieve this.</p><h4>What specific services and infrastructure are you creating in Dodoma?</h4><p>We are responsible for implementing the national ICT backbone, connecting Dodoma to the rest of the country. We are the first utility company that has connected the Prime Minister's offices and residence and we are prepared to continue moving quickly. We will be working on internet connectivity as well as improving the availability of the voice platform. These works are being done in cooperation with our national and international stakeholders. Our partnership with Huawei is performing well and we have completed phases 1, 2, and 3 of the national technology infrastructure, which is primarily focused on the national ICT backbone. It is a symbiotic relationship in that TTCL benefits from the technological support that we receive from Huawei but at the same time Huawei also benefits from the footprint that we have as one of the biggest players in telecoms. We have been in operation for quite some time with other companies in the private sector and things are moving well.</p><h4>What other major services do you currently offer?</h4><p>In 2012, TTCL won a USD6.7 million contract to supply 1,244GB of internet bandwidth to Rwanda for 10 years. We provide that service and are interested in exporting that model to other countries because TTCL is a profit-making entity and as such represents the possibility to supply those services to the rest of East Africa: Kenya, Uganda, and Malawi. We position ourselves as a big player in the East African market and anticipate this contract to continue. Additionally, we bring our services to remote areas of the country. We use 2G as a technology but TTCL will go even further into remote areas, as we have an obligation and mandate as a government entity to enable telecommunication to the rural areas. Whereas our competitors just look on the profit side, we also have a social responsibility to make sure that rural Tanzania is also connected. The sectors that are set to benefit from this are education, health, agriculture, infrastructure and all the trade that takes place between rural Tanzania and the urban centers. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the current status of Statoil's LNG project? </h4><p>Significant technical work has been undertaken and matured to a stage where it is necessary to have the commercial framework in place before further technical work can be done. The commercial framework is set by the Production Sharing Agreement, which Statoil signed in 2007. Based on this, we have invested around USD2 billion in exploration activities for Block 2, which has resulted in several significant discoveries. Our exploration campaign ended in 2015. Since then, our engagement with the government slowed down due to elections, and most of the previous stakeholders we were dealing with are no longer in positions. We have been able to establish new connections and have started meetings with the government to discuss the commercial terms. Even though the PSA to a great extent defines commercial terms, it is necessary to clarify how this applies for a common LNG plant through a Host Government Agreement. It is also necessary to sort out differences with the new Petroleum Act and the PSAs. A site for the LNG plant has been allocated and it is currently in the final stages of the documentation assurance. The land has been chosen based on technical and non-technical suitability and the land titles will be held by TPDC. TPDC, together with the LNG investors, partners in Block 2 as well as partners in Block 1 and 4, have started work on resettlement plans for the people that are affected by land acquired for the LNG plant. The process will focus on treating affected people fairly and complying with international standards.</p><h4>What effect is the president himself having on the process?</h4><p>The president's support for the LNG project is crucial in ensuring that the project obtains the priority it deserves within the government. Government engagement is extremely key in the clarifying the framework for the project. The new Petroleum Act 2015 added uncertainties to the terms of the PSAs. For example, there is a clause on Tanzania's ownership of the companies involved in the project, which we consider to be very demanding for a project of this nature. The requirements have to reflect what is practicable and realistic to achieve in relation to the project; even so there is a strong drive to do more. As the pioneer Tanzania LNG project the regulations should facilitate the project.</p><h4>What challenges do you expect once the legislative framework has been established?</h4><p>It is a challenging project. It is at 2,500m depth, 100km from shore. It is also a gas discovery, which requires a distribution network. The only way we can monetize these discoveries is through LNG export, because there is not a stable, reliable market in East Africa for the production levels that are necessary to materialize the project. According to the terms of the PSA, a percentage of the production will be used domestically, and this will increase the existing available domestic gas by more than 200%.</p><h4>How could this project contribute to the country's industrialization, and what steps could the government take to support that? </h4><p>The gas from Block 1, Block 2, and Block 4 are planned to be produced through a common LNG plant. This project will have a significant impact in terms of finance, and the potential revenue from this project in terms of gas sales and taxation would flow into state coffers. To expand the activity to establish an industry the most important thing Tanzania can do is open up more acreage for more exploration. It is likely that more gas—or oil—would be found, which could be taken to shore and used for domestic purposes. Building the LNG plant in Lindi will create a lot of in-country expertise, and develop an environment upon which to build more industry in Tanzania. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What strategies do you use to sustain the company's development? </h4><p>Oryx Energies has been investing in Tanzania since 1999, providing oil products and services. We have dramatically increased our level of investment in the country over the past three years, and have made investments of over TZS100 billion in our different product and service areas: fuels, LPG, and lubricants. The introduction of franchised Oryx Energies stores, which sell LPG or lubricants, are part of our contribution to reducing counterfeit and illegal products and practices, by creating outlets where customers can be assured that they are buying genuine products. Together, these investments aim to ensure a reliable supply of quality products to consumers across the country, in both urban and rural areas. We see massive potential in Tanzania for fuel and lubricants as the economy grows, as well as using Dar es Salaam as a transit hub to supply neighbouring countries. LPG is a key focus area and Oryx Energies has been promoting LPG as a clean, safe, efficient, and ecological energy alternative to charcoal and firewood in Sub-Saharan Africa for over 15 years. At the end of 2016, we will complete the largest single LPG storage sphere in Tanzania. In 2016, we also built the first LPG cylinder revalidation plant in Tanzania. </p><h4>How do you view the role played by the government in regulating the industry?</h4><p>When greater control equates greater efficiency, it is possible to reduce prices, improve standards, and reduce examples of poor business practices in the interests of consumers. The government in Tanzania has had some success in all these areas. In 2006, it set up the Energy Water Utilities Regulatory Authority (EWURA); one of its roles is to regulate the petroleum industry in terms of setting industry standards, rules, and regulations, and developing a level playing field for all oil-marketing companies. At the end of 2011, EWURA took the important step of introducing a Bulk Procurement System for fuel products. This resulted in a drop in import premiums, as well as a massive improvement in vessel waiting times. As a result, demurrage costs dropped dramatically, lowering fuel prices at the pump. One concrete result is that fuel pump prices in Tanzania are cheaper today than in neighbouring countries.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the energy sector's development and the role that Oryx Energies will play in it?</h4><p>Tanzania will continue to see economic growth, and when we talk about growth, we are inevitably talking about the need for power and energy. As a result, we expect energy requirements in Tanzania to grow significantly over the coming years. The country is blessed with many mineral deposits and natural gas. It also has the desire to build industry and agriculture, and improve the lives and livelihoods of its population. The current government will develop more economical energy through Tanzania Electric Supply Company (TANESCO), as well as developing wind, solar, geothermal, and LNG sources. However, fossil fuels will remain important for a number of years to come in view of the continued growth in energy demand and the insufficient availability of alternatives. </p><h4>What are your goals and expectations for Oryx Energies in 2017?</h4><p>In 2017, we expect to leverage our latest cycle of investments, which position us particularly well to make fuels, LPG, and lubricants easily available to users all over the country. The quality and accessibility of products and services are essential to development, and we are capable of ensuring both. We also hope to benefit from the government's commitment to create a fair business environment and to encourage private sector investment. In terms of LPG, we will contribute to efforts in reducing the use of firewood and charcoal, helping to stop de-forestation and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Oryx Energies stands ready to serve the energy needs of new industries and the population at large. We will continue to invest in the future of Tanzania, creating jobs and promoting entrepreneurship along the way. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Jubilee Insurance is one of the largest insurance companies in East Africa. How does your regional strength translate into the Tanzanian market? </h4><p>We have four more companies in addition to the one in Tanzania; we are in Rwanda, Mauritius, Kenya, and Uganda. One of the things that people know is that at Jubilee we work with multinationals more than anyone. We have many international and multinational clients on our books, and we have partnerships with several companies; therefore, we are able to underwrite business for the multinational employers in the region. For example, some of our medical insurance plans make it easy for us to take care of customers regionally. Jubilee Insurance is a one-stop shop; we give clients a solution in the region as well as in Asia. </p><h4>What opportunities do you see arising from the new president's agenda?</h4><p>As an organization, this is the most positive outcome that we could have hoped for. One of our values is integrity, and it is difficult to work in an environment where corruption is the order of the day. We are excited about the new crackdown on corruption and attempts to level the playing field. We are looking at the agriculture sector, and one of things we aim for is helping with financial and insurance literacy for small farmers. Similarly, Jubilee looks at infrastructure, which it has always been a key insurance provider for. There are many recent infrastructure projects that we are the insurers for, like the new airport terminal. </p><h4>Do you target incoming investors as potential clients?</h4><p>We position ourselves to be able to deliver insurance services to some of these large corporations. Being the market leader, things are focused on being able to help people and alleviate their financial difficulties if there is a claim in the country. We are in the energy sector; we also have a couple of clients in the mining industry, as well as in oil and gas exploration. We look forward to bidding for new clients in a level playing field and taking care of the risks of the megaprojects coming into the country. Our reinsurers are also second to none; they are rated A+ and above through Standard &amp; Poor's. With such strong backing, we are the strongest insurance company in the country, and we will be able to deliver outstanding service and better volume to our clients. </p><h4>What are the major barriers to higher insurance penetration in Tanzania?</h4><p>As an insurance company we need to go to the regions and talk to people about insurance. One important step is that we require incentives to set up some branches in remote areas, as has been the case in countries like India. Micro insurance or compulsory insurance legislation could be an incentive. If the tax barriers were reduced, it would be cheaper for companies to open branches in remote areas. Another problem is the lack of innovation among insurance companies and an overreliance on generic products being used in ways that will not fit some regions. The lack of research into a client's needs damages the ability to meet needs. One possibility is legalizing the selling of insurance through bank branches. We are asking the Bank of Tanzania and the Finance Minister to legalize bank insurance for all insurers of the banks in order to help insurance companies distribute the insurance products through banking halls. It would be a win-win situation for both of us; we would partner with banks and we would be able to increase the penetration level of insurance in this country. We need some organized farming system in order to insure a large number of farmers. We need to organize our farming into strong, cooperative societies so that we can deliver the insurance packages easily. We want weather stations in various places within the country so that we would be able to deliver insurance packages that are weather index-based. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[banking-on-growth]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>DSE was the only stock market to produce positive results in 2015. What are the reasons behind such positive results?</h4><p>On the continent, and globally, investment activities, especially portfolio-related investment activities, were affected by fundamentals and investor sentiment. African countries have been affected by reduced economic activity in China. It needs copper, iron, timber, and agricultural products, and those markets slumbered. Second, we were affected by the weakness of African currencies. However, the stock exchange was not all that affected. Foreign investors lost almost 20% in relation to the loss in the currency alone. Still, fundamentally, looking at the performance of the companies, there were some positive outcomes. Our market is also insulated from global markets in terms of a lack of linkages. Also, as we are a net importer of oil, the reduction in oil prices helped strengthen our economy. We are still one of the only countries in Sub-Saharan African that is doing well. </p><h4>How do you plan to increase the number of companies listed on the stock exchange?</h4><p>There are two ways to increase the activities on the stock market, both in terms of companies that need to raise capital and get listed, and also on the number of investors that use the stock exchange as their investment platform. In terms of increasing the number of listings, we have been generating awareness, especially among the business community. We use mainstream media, social media, and interactions through seminars and forums to create awareness to get more people to understand the benefit of using the stock exchange. Two years ago, we introduced the enterprise growth market, a second-tier segment in the market to enable new SMEs to use the stock exchange to raise capital. The combination of these efforts has served us well and we have gone from one listing per annum to three. The second aspect is the legislative framework. We have seen the government requiring some private sector players to float their shares and allow local citizens to have a stake in those companies, therefore creating a wider economic ownership and wider financial inclusion. The new finance act of 2016 has specifically included a provision that requires telecoms companies to float 25% of their shares within six months. Therefore, we expect some new entrants later in the year. </p><h4>What could be achieved if more people in this country knew the potential and benefit from using the services of the stock exchange?</h4><p>Most Tanzanians do not know the benefits of using the stock exchange for their investment activities and as a less expensive source of capital. As a result, we only have around 450,000 people, which is close to 1% of the total population of our country. We have 25 listed companies, but that is 25% of the total GDP. The potential is huge; however, what hinders growth is the lack of awareness and education on how the stock exchange can be utilized as a platform. There are fiscal incentives provided by the government for institutions as well as individuals. If people could understand the tax benefits provided for them, then we might see a different future.</p><h4>Do you have any specific goals for 2017?</h4><p>We plan to introduce new products and continue to engage the public to leverage on the existing benefits that we have been able to offer. If we are able to leverage on what we have done so far and also introduce new products to the market that would be key. Also, we are still going through a transformation stage, changing the legal framework of our institution to another company. The new mandate and demands will be different because we now serve shareholders. We will have to have a new board that will represent shareholders' interests in this company. What is key is to successfully accomplish what we intended to do with this transformation process. By 2017, we plan to reach this objective. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What strategies have you implemented to ensure the stability of the Tanzanian shilling? </h4><p>BoT intervenes from time to time for the purpose of smoothing short-term fluctuations. Depreciation in the value of the shilling can be a result of a several factors, such as strengthening of the US dollar, decline in export earnings, delays in budget support, and increase in speculative tendencies, especially when there is persistent depreciation. Looking ahead, more has to be done in terms of diversifying the economy and increasing productivity, improving business environment, and addressing infrastructure bottlenecks to attract investments to be able to realize our economic potential and develop greater resilience to economic shocks. </p><h4>What is your assessment of the role of technology plays to boost financial inclusion in Tanzania?</h4><p>In 2006, only 11.2% of adult Tanzanians had access to and used formal financial services. There was roughly 965,000sqkm with poor connectivity, which is larger than the combined area of Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi, with room to spare. Digital technology has provided people the ability to access these areas and has provided a platform for cost effective delivery of financial services. In 2008, Vodacom Tanzania introduced the M-Pesa product, followed by similar solutions from Millicom and Airtel in 2009, then Zantel in 2010. The four electronic money products have enabled various services to be introduced over time. Starting with money transfers from person to person, it has evolved to include utility payments, loan disbursement and repayments, money transfers from/to bank accounts or ATMs, wage repayments, and so on. From 112,000 subscribers in 2008, the number of users of the products has grown to reach 59 million registered accounts at end of May 2016. The regulatory framework required mobile financial service providers to implement systems that are open and interoperable. Since February 18, 2016, all four mobile money service providers have became interoperable. In this regard, Tanzania's strategy to achieve universal financial inclusion will continue to be digitally driven.</p><h4>What are the objectives of the National Financial Inclusion Framework (NFIF) 2016-2020?</h4><p>The NFIF is the key roadmap to address the barriers of access and usage of financial services to the under banked and unbanked population. The NFIF is a public and private sector initiative and therefore has a significant role to play in enhancing the cooperative approach of addressing the challenges of financial inclusion. During its formation, it has leveraged other national issues such as the issuance of National Identification and conduction of a National Risk Assessment, formalization of businesses, and facilitated coordination between financial sector and non-financial sector stakeholders. As a result, it is estimated that by 2017 at least 70% of the adult population will access and use financial services, leaving 30% with partial or without access, an improvement from the 57.7% of  the adult population in 2013. Going forward, the emphasis will be on finding other strategies rather than digital for the last frontiers to bring those people onboard.</p><h4>What are the goals and expectation for the BoT in 2017?</h4><p>In 2016/17, the economic development priorities of the government focused on sustainable development as outlined in the Second Five Year Development Plan. The main emphasis is on strategically mobilizing and organizing national resources for human and industrial development needed to transform Tanzania into a middle-income economy. BoT will continue to focus on maintaining price stability through maintaining the appropriate level of liquidity in the economy by achieving the following monetary policy targets: annual growth of average reserve money not exceeding 13%, annual growth of M3 not exceeding 14.8%, annual growth of private sector credit of about 20.5%, and maintaining gross official reserves at levels adequate to cover at least four months of projected imports of goods and services, excluding FDI-related imports. BoT will continue to pursue a tight monetary policy to ensure that liquidity is consistent with the demands of various economic activities to keep inflation at a single digit-level. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the new government and business environment since the election?</h4><p>This is the first time one sees a statement by a president who walks the talk. He has already taken a stand against corruption and will continue with that. This drive to level the playing field will be a great boost. We have almost 100 companies in 28 countries and 30% of our revenue comes from Tanzania. As an overview, we have drones for border management and mining, and we have an e-health kiosk where patients can connect to doctors around the world. We have also purchased a newspaper and have e-education initiatives in place. In addition, we have a logistics company called Fasta-Fasta, an e-commerce company, ad agencies, social network apps, a supermarket, IT companies, and so on. We accomplished all this after President Magufuli came to power.</p><h4>How do you assess the president's vision of industrializing the country and how does your business fit into this wider picture?</h4><p>We see clearly that all the new policies are directed toward self-reliance, as opposed to being dependent on imports or at the mercy of foreign aid. We therefore view that as an opportunity to move into the import substitution sector and are analyzing the sectors that have great enough demand to determine if we can serve that market with the present tools at our disposal and if the segment is profitable. We currently import almost 70% of dairy products from Kenya; hence, in 2015 we decided to enter into the dairy sector. There was also a sugar crisis and the government is willing to provide incentives to promote sugar production. As the biggest landowner in the country, with 14,000 acres, we invested in the sugar industry after spending months surveying plants in Brazil, Europe, and Africa for the best technical expertise. We are setting up two different plants and the idea is to not only provide supply for domestic consumption but to export as well. One plant is in Morogoro while the second is in Pemba, which has a port.</p><h4>How does the Stone Town Village project fit into the tourism strategy of the country?</h4><p>Today, the entire tourism sector is focused on Zanzibar and Arusha, which sees luxury and nature tourists, with plenty of beaches but no more. There is little to do after 6pm in Zanzibar. There is a developing commercial side, with a growth of offices and commercial real estate, but it is not being coordinated. Our plan is to reclaim an island from the sea. If we receive approval from the government, we intend to develop a financial hub on that island. Our plans incorporate villas, apartments, shopping malls, and commercial buildings. It will cater to tourism in particular, with airlines, tourist offices, shops, cafes, and fine dining options.</p><h4>How do you see the private-public partnerships landscape?</h4><p>We are pleased with the current landscape. We recently applied for a new industrial PPP to manufacture transformers and power meters. We prefer PPPs because they represent an assurance from the government that the output will increase. As a multinational company we have to compare the potential PPPs available in each specific market. For example, taking the demographics into account, a 5% market share in Nigeria or Kenya gives us the same amount of output as a 50% market share here. We believe more in collaboration than competition. It is better for us, therefore, if the government is a partnered stakeholder, giving better results.</p><h4>Do you have a specific goal or expectation for 2017?</h4><p>We want to be the number-one IT company in Africa, offering a range of integrated ICT products. We are working on e-governance, ERPs, SME solutions, and smart city apps; we currently provide a variety of mobile apps to corporates and governments in Africa. That is our focus because looking at the demographics of the country this will be where the opportunities will lie in the future. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role can the private sector play in the long-term development vision, and how can the CEO-Roundtable cooperate to help?</h4><p>The private sector's primary motivation is to make money; therefore, the private sector is not the problem. On the contrary, it can and will be the government's best partner in building the nation. What is needed is a clear framework for collaboration between the government and the private sector in the country. We need plenty of electric energy, and we need the private sector to play a larger role in generating it. The same applies to infrastructure, such as water, rail, roads, airlines, airports, gas and oil pipelines, ports, telecoms, and ICT. The private sector can help build infrastructure with capital, technology, and skills. City rail in Dar es Salaam and other cities with big populations such as Mwanza and Arusha can be big business opportunities, and there are certain private sector players willing and able to make the investments. This plan needs to be negotiated, the conditions need to be created, and the capital and expertise need to be brought into the country. The strategies for achieving these outcomes have to be decided in a collaborative manner between the government, the private sector, and development partners if development is to take place. That is the primary challenge for the current government. </p><h4>Looking at the global competitiveness index, Tanzania ranks 139 out of 189 countries. Is Tanzania a place for investment?</h4><p>China has until recently ranked worse than Tanzania in the World Bank's ease of doing business index, but it attracts the most foreign investment in the world. When the World Bank measures the ease of doing business, it does not measure African states as producers but as consumers. For example, it measures how long it takes for a container to come in and not how long it takes to go out, or how efficient our exports are. Africa's share of global trade is less than 2%, so the outflow of goods from Africa to the rest of the world is insignificant. The World Bank spends a great deal of time writing statistics about that, but my question is what are we doing about our own productivity and how can we increase our share of global trade? The only way Tanzania can start being more relevant in global trade is to become more productive and drastically increase its economic output. We have to become participants in global production and not mere observers, and that requires investment in production and productivity. Turkey, for example, became an interesting place not because it has a huge population and consumes a large amount of stuff but because it is now the leading exporter of technology products to the US. To date, Tanzanian leaders have unfortunately not focused on production and productivity; they focused on aid, loans, grants, and things such as ports, airports, roads, and natural endowments such as minerals and wildlife. No one has seriously tried to answer the question on what that road will carry or what production hubs it will connect to, where the electricity to power the industries, trains, and computer networks will come from, where the people with skills are, or where is the capital to make all this happen. These are the issues we need to focus on and start measuring.</p><h4>What are your goals and expectations for CEO-Roundtable for 2017?</h4><p>There are a number of issues that we work on. We want to continue the conversation with the government about ethics and the fight against corruption, and want to talk about public-private dialog, adding teeth to some of the initiatives that we have been developing together. We want to talk about human capacity development and investment-friendly labor laws. We want to discuss investment in electricity that will power the industries we want to build. There is a great deal that we need to talk about including policy stability, which is a big priority, and we are fighting against the clock. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you classify the current economic situation in Tanzania for investors?</h4><p>The environment for investment at the moment is great, both for domestic investors through venture arrangement and through foreigners when they come to invest. The government has consistently been trying to create a conducive environment for investors. There is policy that is supportive for investment; the regulatory framework is great, although there are some areas that conflict between TIC, investment law, and the Ministry of Finance through the Tanzania revenue authority with the 2014 VAT law. There are some areas that have conflicts but otherwise the investment climate is positive.</p><h4>What is the infrastructure plan to make Tanzania a more attractive place for investors? </h4><p>The private sector is invited to participate through a PPP arrangement, for example. We want those kinds of investments to happen here in Tanzania, where private companies are able to construct roads and charge extra so that they are able to recoup their investment. They could even introduce trams where seated passengers could pay more. People would be willing to pay more to reduce traveling time, and these are the areas where the government is ready to invite the private sector to come and invest.</p><h4>How would you respond to the investment concerns of changing tax regimes?</h4><p>This issue is still being debated within government as we act as a bridge between the investors and the government. It is true that investors are complaining the VAT rule is affecting them, especially the companies that do not allow for grandfathering. The concept of investment incentives is to allow a little bit of incentive in terms of capital goods, goods that are used within construction and production. If we allow for incentives through tax, then companies can operate and build up industries, for example. That alone is useful to investors. The largest taxpayers now in Tanzania grew through these institutions; they were exempted and received tax incentives, and now they are the largest taxpayers in Tanzania, such as Tanzania Breweries and the Tanzania Cigarette Company. These companies grew through TIC as a result of such incentives.</p><h4>How do you plan to double FDI by 2020?</h4><p>That is indeed our goal because we have a five-year development plan that is in line with the ruling party manifesto, which both talk about industrialization. We aim through the industrialization strategy to be able to double FDI. We attract investors to come and invest in manufacturing industries, and in that way we are open now to value addition industries with textiles, gas, food, and many other industries. We would like to see the president every month lay a foundation stone for an industry to manufacture something through value addition items. We would like to see the honorable minister responsible for industries, trade, and investment also busy with laying foundation stones in various regions of our country for industries, and we hope everything remains the same. We hope that with industry we will be able to double FDI. Also, we seek other investment opportunities, like managing to secure the Uganda Tanzania pipeline construction, which is a USD4 billion project coming through Tanzania. There are plans for an LNG plant through a conglomerate of about seven companies, which is worth USD20 billion. The Central railway line will represent almost USD8 billion once it is constructed, and we hope to get something. The new Bagamoyo Port and free zone, which the Chinese via the China Merchant Company seek to construct, will also bring some benefits to the economy, as there will be associated sales there. This is still under negotiation but the prospects are quite high. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What policies is the ministry pursuing to demonstrate policy continuity under the country's new government?</h4><p>Our government promotes industrialization and in doing so we look for sectors that can employ a good number of people. One area is agri-processing. We want to ensure that we produce enough food and that we come up with the industries to process that food to reduce the post-harvest loss. This will also create employment for people working in farms, factories, and the transportation sector. We aim to create employment for at least 40% of the able workforce in Tanzania. As part of this, we focus on the modernization of agriculture and achieving high productivity. We want to ensure we can produce sufficient goods and services to meet local demand, as well as specialized goods for export abroad. We want to achieve import substitution and export promotion. We want our products to be of an international standard. We have some major flagship projects planned. We want to ensure that in this phase we start up the long-time Mchuchuma coal and Liganga iron-ore mining projects. These projects have been on the books and the government's budgets for over 30 years. We want to deliver 600MW from Mchuchuma, with 250MW being used for iron smelting and the rest being fed into the national grid to supply power nationwide. We also have a fertilizer project in Lindi starting in 2016. It involves an international consortium led by German company Ferrostaal Industrial Projects GmbH and will produce around 1.3 million tons of fertilizer per year. The production of fertilizer in Tanzania will be a game-changer as agricultural yields will increase. With higher productivity in farming, we will have cotton and food available at reasonable prices. In other areas, we look to set up a tire manufacturing to service the car industry. This would start as a state-owned company and then be sold to the private sector.</p><h4>Moving forward, how will you manage imports of fertilizers and cotton, as well as prices, to protect investors in these local industries?</h4><p>The protection mechanism we intend to use will ensure that whatever we import is of a high quality and is taxed according to existing laws. With this, our companies will be strong enough to compete. Some companies currently dump substandard and counterfeit products on the Tanzanian market and do not pay duties and taxes. Furthermore, with our new consortium we will have players coming into the market that are competent in their industries, so we do not expect to give subsidies.</p><h4>What is the ministry's view on public ownership and will there be a greater role for the state in the national economy in the coming years?</h4><p>Under our government, there is no such nationalization vocabulary. During the privatization processes, businesses were allocated industries and factories to operate at a profit. They were sold assets at a token price on the condition that they produce goods and services, create employment, and pay taxes. In cases where they have failed to meet these conditions, we ask them to find someone else to run the business. However, there are many genuine reasons why these businesses do not perform. We are working through the reasons and providing guidance. A good number are back on the right track now. For example, some businesses were failing because there was no power; however, we now produce around 1,400MW from gas, hydro, and renewable sources so there is enough electricity available today. Nationalization is not taking place. The government is not taking industry back; if we want to become involved in a sector we will start our own businesses or factories. We want private-sector assets to be profitable because they are strategically located and they support the country's basic infrastructure. The best way to protect our local industries is to work on enforcing existing tax and importation regulations, which we oversee. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you elaborate on your cooperation with the Tanzanian government and the World Bank on your projects here?</h4><p>Since 2012 we have supported the government of Tanzania in translating its Tanzanian Development Vision 2025 from high-level vision statements into granular, implementable programs. Our cooperation is a government-to-government program initiated by former President Kikwete after he observed Malaysia's National Transformation Program (NTP) in action. The Malaysian government agreed to provide the human resources over a period of five years to assist in the development of Tanzania's own systems and human capital. However, the funds to compensate the Malaysian government for the expenses incurred were provided to the government of Tanzania by the UK's Department for International Development (DFID), USAID, the World Bank, and the Swedish government. PEMANDU does not work directly with any of these agencies. We support the Tanzanian government solely. The interests of these various agencies may be reflected in some aspects of TDV2025, but we view those as Tanzanian priorities, and not of the World Bank or any other development partner. Ownership of programs must also be, and be seen to be, vested in the local government.</p><h4>PEMANDU has an office in Tanzania, emulating its work and success in Malaysia. What are the key common factors and differences between the implementation of a transformation agenda between Tanzania and Malaysia?</h4><p>We do not actually have an office there; the Tanzanian Development Vision 2025 program is entirely managed by the Tanzanian government, and we have seconded a team of Malaysians to work with it, at its request, to supplement its human capital base. Tanzania is quite dependent on the largesse of foreign development partners with its Overseas Development Aid (ODA). Its systems and structures are geared very much toward this model whereas Malaysia is quite free from this constraint. In Tanzania, the ability and readiness of the public and private sectors to work together in the national interest is not really there in any meaningful fashion. However, there is a growing willingness to embark on PPP initiatives to enable government funds to be freed up for social sectors. Malaysia will also help to develop this crucial expertise. With that being said, I believe Malaysia and Tanzania have a great deal in common.</p><h4>What are the key strengths of the Tanzanian economy, and what needs to be done to unlock its full potential?</h4><p>In my personal opinion, Tanzania's latent wealth may be one of the highest around. It is incredibly rich in mineral resources, including now newly proven natural gas fields. It has hitherto not benefited from domestic value addition of these mineral resources, but that is something that is bound to change. The country is strategically located as a logistics hub because of its many seaports that are able to serve its landlocked neighbors. Its tourism resources are hugely underexploited due to poor connectivity and lack of proper marketing. It has large swathes of arable land and a large labor force that has not been fully tapped. When the government takes concrete and determined actions to address these deficiencies, the economy will take off.</p><h4>How do you envision Tanzanian-Malaysian relations evolving over time? Where do you see room for increased economic activity between the two nations?</h4><p>The examples I shared of Tanzania's potential wealth—minerals, agriculture, tourism, and so on—were all the same sectors that provided the initial boost for Malaysia's own economic development. Our stories have the same beginning. It should follow that the next chapters will also be similar if we share our transitional experiences. Therefore, I foresee Malaysia and Tanzania continuing to leverage on each other in a win-win partnership through their journey from low-income, commodities-based economies to middle-income, manufacturing-based economies. The key to unlocking this potential will be for Tanzania to be able to clearly communicate its focus and priorities to assist the business community to assess risk versus potential in a transparent manner. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What programs has Finland implemented to support the development of education and healthcare industries in Tanzania?</h4><p>Until 2015, Finland's major contribution to financing education and healthcare was through providing general budget support to Tanzania. We are glad that important results have been achieved in these sectors, in particular the broadening access to primary education. Finland is known for its highly rated education system and we are happy to share our educational expertise with Tanzania and other countries. Finland can provide solid expertise on topics such as teacher education, and intends to do so in the future.</p><h4>How much does Finland welcome the new administration's ambition to transform Tanzania from being an aid recipient country to a stand-alone economy?</h4><p>Tanzania has the ability to achieve this transformation and Finland is being supportive of these important efforts. Over the past decade sub-Saharan Africa has been one of the fastest growing areas in the world despite decreasing commodity prices. Tanzania has significantly boosted its revenue collection to reduce aid dependency. Finland will support Tanzania to build sustainable systems for revenue and tax collection. We are discussing with the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) how Finland could support these efforts together with other development partners, many of whom already are participating for example in the TRA's Tax Modernization Program. The success of the transformation will ultimately depend on Tanzania maintaining its sound macroeconomic policies that support growth and generate employment for people, especially for the growing young population. We are seeing a lot of action being taken and we support the government in efforts to improve public governance, fiscal management, and domestic revenue, which are all critical elements in the process to transform the country.</p><h4>How can Finland help Tanzania achieve such a transformation?</h4><p>The creation of employment and livelihoods is one main element of Finland's collaboration in Tanzania. Finland will concentrate its efforts in two areas: the national innovation system and forestry, which has a close link to the national action against climate change. They are also areas that will benefit from Finland's experience and know-how. To boost the economic development in developing countries the Finnish government has also decided to increase the funding to the public investment, which creates the enabling environment for economic growth. The Finnish government has allocated over EUR500 million in new funding to this effort over this cabinet's four-year period. Our new Public Sector Investment Facility (PIF) will be launched later this year. PIF will provide subsidized loans to public entities in developing countries, enabling investments that deal with key development challenges. Our national development finance institution Finnfund invests in the private sector in developing countries, and received additional funding amounting to EUR130 million this year.</p><h4>What are the major short-term goals for Tanzania-Finnish bilateral relations?</h4><p>While strengthening the commercial ties between our countries, we continue pursuing the objectives of our development cooperation programs. We aim to support the improved performance of the public sector, focusing on the improvement of the public financial management (PFM) systems, which are crucial for macro-economic stability and sustainable development. To support sound leadership, Finland continues to partner with the UONGOZI Institute, which builds competencies of current and emerging leaders in Africa on leadership, executive management, policy development and strategic thinking. Regarding the private sector, access to finance is one of the key bottlenecks for innovative growth oriented companies in Tanzania. To ease the situation, Tanzania is developing a national system for funding innovation through the National Fund for Science and Technology (NFAST). Finland is currently initiating a second phase of a program, which intends to support this effort through technical assistance and financial contributions. In the forestry sector, Finland will support the private sector and local communities to manage and utilize sustainably natural forests and to establish forest plantations. The bilateral programs will support land-use planning and strengthen the forest administration and forest NGOs. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-fresh-start]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are you priorities for the years ahead?</h4><p>In government, I plan to reduce bureaucracy in order to accelerate the implementation of government decisions and projects; impose austerity to reduce expenditures that can be avoided; and restore discipline to government and public service to increase transparency and accountability. In order to implement this we will reduce the size of the cabinet, increase supervision in the collection of taxes to plug tax evasion. We will ensure that those who are supposed to pay taxes pay accordingly. We will increase discipline in government expenditure to ensure that money that is saved goes to development projects. We will administer the laws, regulations and procedures of accountability to leaders and public servants. We will continue to identify and control other areas of unnecessary spending that cost the government a lot of money such as consultants, foreign trips, seminars and workshops, buying foreign goods, and other wasteful things.</p><h4>What key investments is your administration planning to spur economic growth in Tanzania?</h4><p>Our country's economy has been improving and growing an average of 7%, due to the efforts of previous governments to build infrastructure such as roads, ports, railways, telecommunications, and electricity generation and distribution. We will carry forward the construction of new infrastructure, and will attract investors both domestic and foreign. We will build roads linking our cities and district capitals of provinces, in key areas of strategic and economic access, and expansion of roads in cities like Dar es Salaam, which is key because the port is the business gateway to ours and neighboring countries. Over the next five years we plan to build a number of railway lines up to international standards, including Dar es Salaam to Mwanza, from Western Tanzania to Burundi and Kigali, as well as lines in the north and south of Tanzania. Additionally, our country is well endowed with minerals and natural resources. The discovery of natural gas has increased the hopes of many of our people regarding our economic potential in the coming years. The government will ensure that our natural resources are used for the benefit of the nation.</p><h4>What will be your approach to the private sector and to FDI?</h4><p>The private sector is responsible for generating huge economic growth. We have no other way if we really want to build the foundation of a sustainable economy in our country. Tanzania's Development Vision 2025 requires us to build the country's middle-class and to start, we will ensure that existing industries work. Under previous governments the nation privatized assets and the monitoring and supervision of the agreements under which this process occurred was weak, and these industries weakened. I promised that those who obtained the privatized industries would restart production and should start immediately. If they fail then we will take the industries in accordance with the laws and regulations of the country and give them to people who are ready to develop them. We will encourage investors to come to our country. The infrastructure to do this already exists and over time will improve. We will also strive to eliminate distractions and bureaucracy of this kind and try to convince domestic and foreign investors to increase industries in the country. We will no longer tolerate government officials who hinder efforts at investment and construction industries in the country.</p><h4>What sectors are most important to achieving economic goals?</h4><p>We would like to grow industries that use raw materials from Tanzania, particularly from agriculture, livestock, fishing, and mining. Manufacturing of this type will provide us with the opportunity to create a production system. Additionally, industries producing goods for mass consumption such as clothing, shoes, and cooking oil will be assured on the local market before considering the export market. That will also add to our reserves of foreign currency and enable us to implement and develop other initiatives for the welfare of our economy. The third industrial feature we are aiming for is generating more jobs. Our objective is that by 2020 the number of jobs resulting from industry reaches 40% of all employment. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the business school's main source of students?</h4><p>We have over 100 nationalities represented on our Manchester Business School (MBS) part-time MBA program, with around 45% of our 2,000 MBA students residing in the UAE and the balance in the GCC and wider region. As part of the program, we encourage and facilitate student visits to at least one of our five other international centers during their studies to attend student workshops. We cover the cost of accommodation in two locations in order to give them a more global perspective and network. We consistently have students coming from a core of industry sectors, including consultancy, engineering, construction management, software management, oil and gas, as well as ICT backgrounds. There has been an increase in the number of entrepreneurs becoming successful business owners after taking an MBA, and we have seen a surge in the number students pursuing an MBA to advance in their careers or move out of their industry. The MBA has been a real catalyst for entrepreneurs developing their own SMEs. Female participation has increased significantly over the past few semesters, reaching 20% of the latest student intake.</p><h4>What expansion plans do you have to further support this growth?</h4><p>On 1st January 2017 we officially became the University of Manchester Middle East Centre, and MBS is now one of the schools within the university that we support in the region. We are in an amazing country and a city where history is being made. This success has attracted the interest of the wider university and other schools to look at what else we could do here, starting with the school of engineering. We are now offering a new part-time MSc in Reliability Engineering and Asset Management. We will be expanding our premises here at Dubai Knowledge Park. At the moment we use the facilities at Dubai Knowledge Park and we also conduct some MBA student workshops at Dubai World Trade Centre, but we are bringing these in-house so over time we will have our own larger facilities to host engineering and international healthcare leadership workshops.</p><h4>How is the syllabus changing to reflect the needs of the working world?</h4><p>We make sure that we keep our programs relevant to global trends, not just those within the UAE and Middle East. Our core program is the Global Part-time MBA for working professionals across the globe. The MBA program that we offer here is fundamentally the same program that we offer in Manchester, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore, and the US, through our partnership with Kelly School of Business and in Brazil through our partnership with FVG. We have redesigned our part-time MBA as a two-year program, starting from January 2017. There is still a level of flexibility within the program and students can still extend the course to five years if necessary. In the redesigned MBA, we have moved away from individual subjects to management themes and within those themes we are teaching in modules and focusing on learning through experience. Experiential and practice-based learning is at the heart of the way MBS works. We always look at the regions that our students are coming from and try to ensure that our program reflects some of the local business conditions. MBS operates from business hubs in regions across the world, which helps to make the global MBA relevant to the global business audience. The same approach applies to the executive education short courses that we have also introduced into the region.</p><h4>How does the business school complement the policy of developing a knowledge economy?</h4><p>Business education is key to developing knowledge economies. We support the development and retention of talent through business education and help attract talented business professionals to the region. The business education provider plays a significant role in designing and delivering programs to match the visions of the countries in the region, and acts as an enabler for achieving governments objectives. Creativity and innovation must be at the heart of everything that we do to enable these knowledge-based economies, and education is key to developing a successful, well-rounded national economy.</p><h4>How does the public-private relationship work for you and how does it relate to the courses?</h4><p>We have focused on building long-term relationships from the beginning. MBS has been in the region for more than 10 years and has become the largest and fastest-growing international branch of Manchester Business School. Public-private partnerships have a huge impact on business and we have invested a lot of effort in bringing in partners to help develop business ideas into tangible projects, as with our Manchester Innovation Award for Emiratis initiative, for example. We are also working with corporates within our Talent Management framework. Ultimately, we are helping to provide the academic framework to stimulate and promote innovation within the Emirates with an ecosystem to foster innovative business ideas.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has ARS worked to increase its market share and national coverage over the past year?</h4><p>We can proudly say that we have reached our objective. Our market share has grown by 11% in two years, up to 21%. This has been possible thanks to the fact that we are the fastest growing company in the health insurance sector in the Dominican Republic. In the last couple of years we have expanded our number of affiliates from 694 to 810, and our geographic coverage has grown too. Now, we have offices in 20 different cities and municipalities throughout the country.</p><h4>How has the insurance market evolved in the Dominican Republic in the last few years and how has ARS Palic adapted to this change?</h4><p>The sector is growing rapidly, due to the fact that the country's social insurance system is still relatively young. It was only set up eight years ago and covered around 500,000 people. Today 67% of the population is covered, or approximately 6.7 million people. One of the main challenges we faced was adapting to a sector which was changing rapidly. We always look to the future and adapt to the increasing number of affiliates and medical services provided and covered by the system. We have put a lot of effort into being ready to capture these changes from a human resources and technological point of view. Our target was always to grow faster than the sector, which we have achieved year after year.</p><h4>How has technology transformed the way ARS Palic does business?</h4><p>Technology has been one of the leading drivers behind ARS Palic's growth and expansion. We believe technology has a vital role to play in different spheres of our daily activity and interaction with customers. We were the first insurance company with our own native app and the first with a digital transactional system for service providers and intermediaries. Internally, we have implemented CMR software with Salesforce to manage relationships with our customers. New technologies enable us to provide high quality services to the more than 800,000 affiliates that we have. We always bear in mind in our strategy that we live in an increasingly demanding and ever-growing world in terms of technology. All in all, better technology makes us more competitive.</p><h4>What are some major challenges facing the country in terms of expanding coverage among the population?</h4><p>In order to expand social security coverage to a larger segment of the population, we need to tackle the informal economy. Half the population is engaged in this unregulated economy. We also need to keep in mind that not everybody within that group can contribute to the system and some might need subsidies. We need to better understand their situation. This will be one of the main topics of discussion in the near future as we start discussing the finer details of legal and labor reforms in the country. We need to find the tools and strategies to reduce informality in our economy, encourage these micro entrepreneurs and SMEs to regularize their situation, and help people subscribe to the social security system independently. Health insurance is a good way to start reducing the informal economy before moving into things like pensions and other insurance products.</p><h4>How did the health insurance sector in the Dominican Republic react to the Zika virus outbreak?</h4><p>The Zika virus was a major challenge for the country because it required joint efforts at the national level between the Ministry of Health, in terms of education and control, and between the health insurance sector. The country as a whole responded well to the virus by focusing on the root of the problem. For example, we worked closely with UNICEF to implement informative prevention campaigns at the national level. In terms of the impact on the sector, this was quite significant. We saw the number of emergency cases, hospital treatments, and health insurance claims go up considerably. The government responded to this crisis with a centralized purchase of drugs for the treatment of the Zika virus alongside other regional governments which had the same problem. This brought down the cost of the treatment for Guillain-Barré, a syndrome associated with Zika, from around DOP1 million DOP (USD21,882) per patient to DOP286,000 (USD5,865) per patient. This was a perfect example of a joint public-private collaboration that achieved much better results for the population. At the moment, our attention is on pregnant women that were infected and their newborns we now need to check on. Nevertheless, Zika is no longer an epidemic problem and the situation is under control at the national level.</p><h4>What do you see the insurance sector looking like in five years' time?</h4><p>We need to tackle the challenge of independent workers as well as micro and other small enterprises as quickly as possible. Once we do so, the sector will open the door for many growth opportunities. We should also see fewer industry players in five years' time, which will lead to a further concentration of providers and more advancement in treatment methods as well as technologies. I also foresee changes in the provision of services and access to service models. Today, we have a totally open model where anyone can go anywhere. This is not economically sustainable in the long run. Nonetheless, I see more people being covered by a higher quality of services in the years to come.</p><h4>What are ARS Palic's goals for 2017?</h4><p>We want to consolidate our growth above the market rate and do so in a sustainable and socially responsible way. We have been certified by the “Great Place to Work Institute" as one of the top companies in the Caribbean and are committed to offering the best environment to our employees. We want to continue our technological transformation and maximize the possibilities of our CRM platform. We foresee more technological changes related to risk management in order to better prevent chronic diseases, which is one of the key health challenges in the world right now.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Nigerian government intends to increase broadband penetration from 8-30% by 2018. What are the government's strategies for realizing this goal? </h4><p>The government should not be using its own resources for the purpose of investment in infrastructure. All the government does is provide an enabling environment for private sector participation. We are talking to everybody, local and foreign investors, to let them know about the opportunities that exist. Nigeria is an expansive country with a huge population, which translates into a major market for their businesses. Many local and foreign entrepreneurs have already made some investments in the sector and further proposals are forthcoming. Some want to use conventional broadband, by placing fiber optics underground, while others are even bringing the novel idea of placing the fiber-optic cables on the electricity poles around the country. We are happy with the regulatory environment that has been created, which, combined with the huge population and stable government, illustrate to investors that Nigeria is the place to go. We are optimistic we will be able to meet our target of 30% penetration within the shortest possible time.</p><h4>You mentioned that broadband penetration will reach rural areas. How will this make an impact on the daily life of rural communities?</h4><p>In expanding broadband from one city to another, a certain amount of the rural areas in between will get connectivity as well. We have governmental institutions all over this country, and we want all of them to take advantage of the opportunities that ICT presents. Life in the rural areas can change considerably with access to ICT. People there can become better educated, because they have access to virtual libraries and are able to communicate and create opportunities for new businesses. From my village, about 150km from Ibadan, around 800 vehicles come to the city daily to buy things, but if we have enough connectivity e-commerce will thrive and people will not have to make the daily journey to larger cities.</p><h4>How do you assess the evolution of e-commerce in the country? </h4><p>It is growing exponentially and many companies are keen to get involved. Three or four years ago, we had just one company involved, but today we have at least 10 and they are all doing excellent business.</p><h4>How can new technologies help the government in its quest to promote greater transparency and reduce corruption?</h4><p>Through the e-governance process, the government will be able to increase efficiency and fight corruption, and make the economy robust in the sense that it decreases the need to carry cash. ICT also provides us with more options in terms of payment systems. Even in terms of salaries, e-payments are easier and more transparent. Within the banking sector, digitization through ATM networks is speeding up banking processes. E-banking is possible through the use of smartphones and it is more efficient because people do not have to travel to a bank in order to make and receive payments. We see e-governance as a way of providing solutions to businesses, educational institutions, and the agricultural sector in particular, as well as mining and other aspects of governance.</p><h4>What is the government's strategy for fighting cybercrime?</h4><p>We have an anti-cybercrime law in place, which connects all of the security agencies and gives each of them a role to play. We also benefit from strategies adopted at the international level to fight cybercrime in Nigeria. Cybercrime knows no boundaries so we are leveraging all of the strategies that are evolving to fight cybercrime globally.</p><h4>This year we are focusing on the empowerment of women. How would you describe the role of women in the communications sector?</h4><p>I am happy to report that in Nigeria today women are increasingly getting involved in the communications sector. Women form a key component of the ICT revolution, not just in Nigeria but around the world. I am happy that Nigerian women are not being left out. One of the pioneers in the ICT business in Nigeria is a woman, Florence Seriki, an engineer who heads a large company with branches around the country dealing with both software and hardware.</p><h4>How would you describe the importance of ICT and communications in diversifying the economy and creating economic growth?</h4><p>Nigeria has depended on oil and gas as a means of powering its economy for a long time. That became a burden because it prevented us from exploring other natural resources. More people are engaging in ICT over oil and gas or mining. This is purely due to the fact that investment in those resources can take generations to produce a ROI. In comparison, the ICT sector is non-exploitative and is not an extractive industry, and, therefore you do not need much investment when compared with others. Many countries that do not have natural resources are relying on human resourcefulness instead. Throughout the continent, countries such as Kenya, Rwanda, and South Africa use and rely on ICT to develop businesses and drive their economy. Even though we are a late starter, we believe that we are realizing the potential that ICT can hold in diversifying the Nigerian economy. We have already started this process and believe it is something that will not stop.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>My expectation is that by the end of 2017 we should be able to develop more than 10 new technology villages and knowledge centers across the country. We will establish them, but they will be private sector driven. We need the citizens of Nigeria to take full advantage of these new institutions.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us some background on GE's operations in Kazakhstan and how your international expertise is helping localize advanced technologies?</h4><p>GE has been working in Kazakhstan since the middle of the last century—our first sale was in 1930 for the mining industry. Today, we are proud to be active in nearly every industry with our broad technology portfolio. For example, GE engines are powering hundreds of Kazakhstan Temir Zholy (KTZ) locomotives and dozens of airplanes operated by Air Astana and other airlines. In addition, thousands of units of GE equipment are supporting the oil and gas and healthcare industries in Kazakhstan. Our overall approach is long-term partnership with the government and the country's leading companies on key projects to modernize industrial infrastructure. Probably we could say that our biggest localization success so far has been our partnership with KTZ. In 2009, the first GE-powered locomotive made in Kazakhstan rolled off the assembly line and onto the rails. To date, we have helped produce and modernize over 700 locomotives. Today about 90% of freight locomotives in Kazakhstan are powered by GE engines, with much higher efficiency and lower emissions than the legacy fleet, and as a result, Kazakhstan has the youngest and the most fuel-efficient locomotive fleet in the CIS region. We continue to supply the engine kit, but everything else is locally produced. This project was destined to success thanks to the perfect alignment between GE's long-term commitment and the country's strategic priority to develop the non-resource sectors of the economy, as well as its vast geography and rail network, which is quite similar to other large countries like the US, China, or Russia. In fact, Kazakhstan is GE's second-largest rail market globally and our largest hub of locomotive production outside of the US.</p><h4>What other partnerships and programs do you have beyond the rail industry?</h4><p>In addition to working with KTZ, we are also localizing oil and gas equipment servicing by teaming up with our local partner ZKMK. That project includes a long-term technology transfer and license agreement, which will enable ZKMK to locally maintain the fleet of GE Oil &amp; Gas turbines and compressors installed across Kazakhstan and Central Asia. That's an important capability because it gives our customers confidence in knowing that potential issues can be resolved quickly with local resources. It also demonstrates GE's commitment to develop human talent by localizing technical expertise. We have had great success with this same approach in healthcare. In 2007, we localized expertise in maintaining medical equipment by establishing a service center in Almaty. That has supported the growth of our installed base to over 2,000 ultrasounds, MRIs, PET/CTs and other high-tech equipment at hospitals and clinics across the country. In addition, we are also offering our Crotonville leadership training as part of our strategic cooperation with Nazarbayev University. GE is recognized as one of the world's top companies for professional development, and we are committed to helping train the next generation of leaders in Kazakhstan.</p><h4>How would you assess the role that GE plays in the diversification strategy adopted by the Kazakhstani government?</h4><p>We are certainly contributing. Diversification is a long-term process that requires investment in many areas, including education. We try to make use of every available opportunity to transfer knowledge. In addition to higher education, GE is also lending its expertise in important growth segments. For example, we are sharing global best practices with the Ministry of Energy as it develops regulations for the renewables sector. We see significant potential for renewable energy in Kazakhstan, especially wind power. Obviously, it is difficult to build an industry from scratch, but companies like GE can offer vast international expertise to help make it happen.</p><h4>Which sectors have the most potential for investment in public-private partnerships?</h4><p>Kazakhstan is now undergoing its largest economic transformation since independence. We see great potential to energize the economy by streamlining state holdings and transferring non-core assets to private investors. From our point of view, we see major opportunities for modernization in the power sector, given that today about 85% of electricity is generated by coal. We also see great potential for digital solutions to improve the efficiency of industrial assets. In a world of limited investment, it is a good time to focus on technologies that can get more value from existing infrastructure. We believe digitization can help improve Kazakhstan's competitive advantage.</p><h4>GE is a major partner of the upcoming Expo. What will be the long-term impact of the event in promoting the country and on Kazakhstan's overall economy?</h4><p>EXPO-2017 is a timely platform for the global community to join together to discuss our common energy challenges. It will also give business leaders and government officials from around the world the chance to see the progress achieved in Kazakhstan with their own eyes. As an energy infrastructure company, we are excited about this opportunity to showcase our capabilities and share our vision. We will be actively participating throughout the event, from the Energy Best Practices area (eBPa) to the USA Pavilion, which will feature cutting-edge technologies from around the US across all energy sectors. We believe that energy access is a basic human right and we are committed to helping provide affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy to every person and industry on the planet. We are on the edge of great change in the energy industry, especially in the renewables segment. The development of technology has reached a point where we need to stop and think about ways to improve the efficiency of everything around us. Among other factors, digitization and the “industrial internet" will play a significant role. This can only happen if the entire global community is involved, and Kazakhstan will play a key role in enabling that discussion by hosting EXPO-2017.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the coming year?</h4><p>The current environment remains complicated and industrial growth around the world continues to be constrained by limited investment. At the same time, we are beginning to see positive signs on the horizon. Overall, the last three or four years have shown us that resource-rich countries can no longer rely on high commodity prices—they need to learn to adapt and live in a new environment. The president and government of Kazakhstan have taken steps to lay a solid foundation for future growth. I live and work in Astana and every day I see the great potential here. I am an optimist about the long term, and am looking forward to what the new year will bring.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Malaysia holds more than a quarter of the world's Islamic assets. What is your vision for moving the industry forward and making Malaysia the global driving force? </h4><p>Malaysia's decades of experience in Islamic finance has put it in a leading position globally. Islamic finance has become a key segment in the domestic financial system, and Islamic banking assets now stand at about 27% of total banking assets, surpassing the 20% target originally set out in Bank Negara's Financial Sector Masterplan. There is also greater acceptance of takaful with an increased penetration rate at 14.8% of the population. Backed by a robust sharia screening methodology, more than 70% of total listed securities in the country are sharia-compliant, providing a wide array of choice for investors. Malaysia, with its consistent global sukuk market share of more than 50% over the past 10 years, has sustained its position as market leader. Progress is also evident in our attempts to become a center for Islamic fund and wealth management. We have emerged as hub for this activity, with a 35% market share and the largest number of Islamic funds out of any country.  While achievements in various market segments have placed us at the forefront, more groundbreaking initiatives are needed to seize opportunities in new growth areas and to re-energize the industry. An honest assessment of the existing business models and product offerings must be undertaken to recognize problems, which is a crucial step towards realizing the true value propositions of Islamic finance. Greater innovations such as Bursa Malaysia-I and Investment Account Platform (IAP) are some of the initiatives that could chart a new phase of growth for the industry and keep Malaysia at the forefront of the development curve.  The Malaysian brand of Islamic finance must also transcend beyond borders and belief as the industry has become part of growth strategies of global financial players, indicating greater appreciation of its value proposition. This is evident in the increasing presence of global banking players from diverse regions including Japan, Europe, and the Middle East operating in Malaysia. In addition, embarking on digital innovation and making use of well-rounded talent could provide an additional competitive edge to the industry, particularly in scaling up businesses beyond traditional limitations and enhancing operational efficiency, all of which would be key to making Islamic finance more mainstream in the global banking system.</p><h4>Recently, Bursa Malaysia launched the Bursa-I platform, creating a sharia-compliant marketplace. What are your thoughts here?</h4><p>It is worth noting that sharia-based equity investing has become a significant contributor to the growth of the domestic equity market in the past decade. Sharia-compliant securities in Bursa Malaysia now amounted to MYR1.1 trillion and account for about 64% of total market capitalization. Continued efforts and initiatives by the Securities Commission Malaysia as well as its Sharia Advisory Council have not only played an invaluable role in enhancing the depth and breadth of the Islamic capital markets but also facilitated the development of innovative products that we have today, such as Islamic REITs, Islamic ETFs, and retail sukuk. As such, it is encouraging to see Bursa Malaysia taking this leading role in strengthening the ecosystem by championing exchange-based sharia-compliant investing and providing new options for those who wish to invest based on the principles of Islamic finance. Indeed, principled investing practices based on sharia are an important part of living life responsibly, through responsible investing. It is envisaged that this new platform will position Bursa Malaysia as the leading exchange in the Islamic capital market for sharia investments, and will be globally recognized as <em>the </em>marketplace for sharia-compliant trading activities among domestic, regional, and global issuers and investors. Such dedicated platforms will also help to promote and increase the visibility of Islamic Participation Organizations that offer Islamic stockbroking services to both retail and institutional investors and ensure the holistic growth of the Islamic capital market industry across the value chain.</p><h4>What role do you envision for Malaysia in driving Islamic finance across ASEAN?</h4><p>The further intensification of financial linkagess within the ASEAN region will indeed position Malaysia to reap the benefits of the economic community. ASEAN is home to a rapidly growing capital market, in which total market capitalization amounted to about USD2.3 trillion or 90% of GDP in 2015. With ASEAN households having one of the highest savings rates at about 30%, there is tremendous opportunity to bring sharia-based financial services to the 600 million people living within the ASEAN region. Malaysia is now positioned at the forefront of international developments, with increasing connectivity between financial centreers and more cross-border Islamic financial transactions. These links open up greater opportunities to introduce and strategically position Islamic finance services globally, while providing opportunities for the meaningful participation of our local players as lead arrangers for some of the global sukuk issuance. The gains are also extended to our ancillary service providers which have been able to establish greater connections in the international market. In addition, our expertise, innovations, and deals originating in Malaysia and into ASEAN will help to shape the regional financial landscape to be fairer, more just, and more transparent. Multi-currency expertise, financing expertise for industries like infrastructure and energy that are well suited to Islamic financing, and wealth management expertise will need to form our next wave of services emanating from Malaysia.</p><h4>FinTech is often mentioned as a game changer for the financial industry. How should Malaysia embrace this going forward?</h4><p>The rising significance of FinTech has revolutionized and supported the growth of the financial system beyond traditional channels such as banks and capital market intermediaries. These include the way people participate in alternative finance, such as crowdfunding platforms and digital currencies like Bitcoin, to mention just a few. Following the leads of other financial regulators in Australia, China, Singapore, the UK and the US in embracing disruptive innovation in the financial industry, Bank Negara Malaysia has recently issued details for the FinTech regulatory sandbox framework to pave the way for innovation in the banking system. However, it is important to note that our Sandbox is unlike any other since it is the first to include Islamic finance. Indeed, the integration of digitization strategies in the business model of our domestic players is already taking place with the launch of the Investment Account Platform as the first banking-intermediated internet-based platform in Islamic finance. Moreover, we also made inroads in allowing digital-based alternative finance to be more accessible to the wider population. The government through the Securities Commission were the first in the ASEAN region to legalize the Equity Crowdfunding platform in 2014 and we have also introduced the regulatory framework for Peer to Peer (P2P) Financing more recently. This is the first step towards channeling the power of digital markets to open new doors and create democratizing opportunities for small businesses and retail investors, giving them access to products and services previously deemed too costly to be offered to the masses. Given the regulatory support and continuous enhancement of the digital eco-system environment that the country is embarking upon, the finance industry must rise to the challenge by expanding their frontiers in terms of innovation. This could be through the greater intensification of technology within their business models or even through greater collaboration with FinTech startups. Rather than looking at the FinTech revolution as an unwelcoming and disruptive force, the industry ought to embrace it as an opportunity to significantly enhance values and experience for consumers for the betterment of the economy and society at large.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the Ministry reducing the country's fiscal deficit, which rose by 3.9% of GDP in the first ten months of 2016?</h4><p>When we took office we did an in-depth analysis of the main financial indicators and policies that had been implemented up to that point. An example of this is that between 2008 and 2010 there was a considerable increase in public wages, but no new resources were created to finance this expenditure. We inherited a regulatory framework with outdated laws for both income and VAT taxes, which is why there have been certain elements of our work that we have not been able to fully control so far. The technological apparatus inherited was old-fashioned. In fact, there were some things that were actually monitored and calculated with an excel spreadsheet, for example. This led us to start thinking of reform. We took the decision to start preparing several projects to meet the needs to tackle the above-mentioned situations. Now, we have focused on income, expenses, and new technologies to improve tax collection. Parallel to the reform we have implemented several new laws. In terms of expenses, for example, we passed new laws on pensions that are funded by the national budget. Within the focus on expenses, the Caja íšnica concept is a mechanism through which certain resources get transferred from a ministry to its decentralized agencies. These entities have accumulated balances over the years, known as “single-box balances," but recently we passed a law that writes off those liabilities after two years. In terms of income priorities we have approved a draft law to tackle smuggling, while two others are about to be approved to deal with fiscal fraud and legal persons. In this context we have five more draft law projects lined up, namely VAT, income tax, public employment, exonerations, and fiscal regulation.</p><h4>How do you assess the commitment made by the government to spend less and raise more revenue without increasing taxes?</h4><p>We have put a lot of effort into collecting more and spending less. For example, we have implemented digital tools for people to pay taxes directly on the ministry's website. That change contributed to increasing the overall volume of tax returns to 18% more than expected. We also created more synergies within the ministry's main areas of work in order to increase the level of tax intelligence. For example, we have increased the number of taxpayer profiles (large corporations and other companies) in our database. In Costa Rica we have a register of 490 large taxpayers.  The idea is to better understand the behavior of companies and improve the tax collection efforts of the government. Our activity has been directed at increasing tax collection and avoiding fraud. We have seen that income tax has increased by 15% in the last two years, which is the result of our action and efforts. This has also contributed to stopping a trend we observed when we arrived in office; year after year, expenses were growing much faster than income. This is something we have documented.</p><h4>What is the current level of primary deficit?</h4><p>We calculate both the primary deficit and the financial deficit (the same, but including interest). In both 2014 and 2015, these deficits increased. However, in 2016 (data to October) we managed to reduce them. In 2016, the primary deficit was CRC519 billion, whereas in 2015 it was CRC702 billion. We are talking about a reduction of  CRC180 billion. Now we are at a similar level as to that of 2013. Total income grew in 2016 by almost 9% and income on utilities is up by 14.5%. In this context, total expenses have only increased by 3.6%. This is key to reducing the primary deficit. Regarding the financial deficit, this stands in 2016 at CRC1.2 billion, whereas in 2015 it was CRC1.35 billion. The primary deficit represents 1.7% of the country's GDP, but in 2015 this figure reached 2.4%. The fiscal deficit today represents 3.9% of the GDP, whereas last year the percentage stood at 4.7%. This is a clear sign of the financial improvement we brought thanks to the implementation of new technologies, better collection of taxes, and other such measures.</p><h4>What is the attraction of Costa Rica's finance sector for foreign investors? </h4><p>We are mainly focused on the country's financial activity. As a ministry, we leave the effort to attract foreign investment to other ministries and public organizations. Having said that, we can say that Costa Rica is an attractive investment destination. We have been reducing interest rates, have a stable exchange rate, legal and regulatory stability, and are making continuous efforts to guarantee an ideal investment atmosphere. We are also increasing our available resources and have an effective treasury. We offer great macroeconomic and microeconomic stability. On top of all that, there are no limitations for companies who want to access credit. However, the most important thing here is having a skilled and talented human workforce available.</p><h4>What are your key priorities for the rest of your administration?</h4><p>We want to continue implementing the same types of policies and actions we have done for the last couple of years: e-taxation and the implementation of new technologies in most of our processes. We understand that nowadays you cannot move forward without the implementation of new technologies. We also need to consolidate the tax reform with projects that are still pending approval. As 2017 will be a pre-election year, that means time is running out to do everything we need to. Overall, we are satisfied with the work done up until this moment, for the development of the country from the moment we took over has been palpable. At the same time, we believe there is still a lot we can do and will work toward that end.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What strategy are you following to maintain Dos Pinos' leading position?</h4><p>Dos Pinos is an icon in Costa Rica and is its most valued brand. Dos Pinos was formed 69 years ago by 25 small farmers. At that time, the visionary shipment was an important thing for the country because we were the first cooperative in Central America to implement the pasteurization of milk back in the 1950s. We began to provide health and nutrition for our children and to our consumers, which is why Dos Pinos is what it is now. Since the beginning, we innovated, invested, and provided added value for our customers through healthy products, as well as increased the wellness of the population across Costa Rica. To strength and maintain our leading position we have focused on our consumers, making sure we are satisfying and accomplishing their evolving needs. This will be driven by passion for innovation in order to be able to provide good and fresh news to the market permanently and all of it supported by a culture of operational excellence and efficiency. This is the foundation of our current success.</p><h4>What is the importance of Costa Rica for the whole group?</h4><p>Dos Pinos is the most important milk producer in Costa Rica, and we are the absolute leaders in the local dairy industry. We are not only milk producers, but we are also a cooperative that is owned by 2,000 people (1,400 farmers and 600 employees), most which are SME milk producers, which is very important because as a cooperative the most important goal is to provide the benefits to our associates. Given the fact Dos Pinos has also been investing in technology and equipment distribution, we are the most powerful force of distribution in the country in the dry, frozen, and cold environments, and we have the three types of distribution force in Costa Rica as well as throughout the region. Dos Pinos provides employment for more than 4,500 people in the Central American region and generates more than 50,000 indirect jobs given its massive operations in Costa Rica and the region as well. Our business size is equivalent to the 1.7 % of the GDP of our country.</p><h4>What is the importance of Costa Rica for the group, and what are your expansion plans?</h4><p>Central America and the Caribbean are our most important markets, though we are always open to review and take advantage of any opportunities that may arise. We focus especially on Central America and the Caribbean because we believe that we have the space to grow there and to provide health and nutrition to the populations of those countries. We are ready to enhance and increase our market participation in Costa Rica and the region.</p><h4>What other non-milk products is the company considering to offer?</h4><p>Our strategy is to transform our dairy business, keeping it always at the core of the cooperative but moving toward a food industry model, including activities in beverages and snacks as well as some other types of food products that create a synergy with the facilities and capabilities that we have now.</p><h4>Can you describe the process of acquiring Gallito?</h4><p>Gallito is an important achievement for us, and it is a strategic investment that we are doing. Dos Pinos and Gallito are well-known brands in Costa Rica, and together they generate synergy and make a powerful cocktail for the benefit of our customers. Dos Pinos has decided on a strategy based on three main principles. We are always looking to satisfy our customers or consumer necessities, and it is based on this that we design products, innovate, and invest in order to provide this innovation to give fresh news to our customers. All of this is founded on a platform we call operational excellence, in which we try to be efficient and maintain the lowest costs possible in order to provide competitive products to our customers.</p><h4>What are the main initiatives that Dos Pinos is taking toward environmental and social responsibility?</h4><p>Social responsibility is in our DNA as a cooperative, as we have 2,000 owners and most of them are small and medium-sized farmers. We have several specific programs in terms of recycling packaging materials, and we produce some raw materials for the building of desks for schools. This is a successful program, and we have produced and donated more than 9,000 desks for public schools in the country. We have an important nutrition program in the schools, whereby we visit the schools and talk to the children about healthy food consumption habits, how to balance their diet, and how to balance nutrition in order to leave a healthy life. Those things are important for us. We are also involved in other important initiatives, such as food banks, which provide food to people without shelter or living in social hardship. We believe in social responsibility and we really live it and practice it.</p><h4>To which markets is Dos Pinos exporting the most, and are you planning to open in more markets?</h4><p>We are most concentrated in Central America and the Caribbean. From Costa Rica we are exporting mostly to Guatemala, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, followed by El Salvador, Honduras, the US, and the rest of South America, with something even in Venezuela. Generally speaking, other than Costa Rica those are the most important countries for us.</p><h4>Costa Ricans consume an average of 200 liters of milk per capita each year, which is the third most in Latin America. With this figures increasing every year, what is your medium-term vision for the market?</h4><p>There is always an opportunity because innovation is always something that will provide an opportunity to bring back to the table and to the customer new offerings. This is why we believe that innovation is one of our most important elements to maintain and enhance, as it is the only way we see to find new customers for our products. We believe that the market could still grow, and we are also diversifying our business as we did with the beverage plant. We believe that these combinations of strategies will provide us with the necessary force to grow our business in the long term.</p><h4>What are your goals for 2017?</h4><p>Our priority is to continue to grow and strengthen our leadership in the Central American market. We will defend what we have grown in Costa Rica, but we are also diversifying our portfolio by providing value added products to our customers. We will continue working every day in line with our strategic objectives: diversification, innovation, profitability of farms, sustained growth in core business, and organizational excellence for our business in Costa Rica and the rest of the region.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Given the continued rise of M&amp;As and an active bond market, what services are in highest demand in the UAE?</h4><p>Our services change with the dynamics of Dubai and the UAE, and also with the wider region to some extent. During the 1980s the government was primarily trying to develop the free zones and the warehousing industrial exports, and we were also active with IPOs. Since the IT boom there has been a lot more work in software and the production of brands, which drew a lot of companies here and energized the intellectual property space. Real estate work boomed from 2003 onwards, as did mergers and acquisitions and capital markets work. All of that has brought the UAE markets, and to some extent the GCC markets, maturity. As well as operating on a larger scale, with bigger mergers and acquisitions, the style has also changed from individuals to corporations, groups, funds, investments, and so on. Now, the move is largely toward the emergence of new sectors such as renewables and data. With those changes we had to adapt our style and focus very closely on new hires, ensuring we were recruiting individuals specialized in intellectual property rights, something we previously did not have any experience with. Underpinning all of this is the drive to create a highly transparent and regulated society, making the UAE as a very attractive destination to do business.</p><h4>How has the shift from shop floor to boardroom altered things for your company?</h4><p>It had multiple effects on the style of the business and on us running our firm and doing business with our clients; it is partly global and partly local. There is huge pressure on attracting talent but the good news for attracting talent in the UAE is that in previous years we had to pay a premium to attract talent to the country, but that is not the case now as Dubai sells itself as a location. The economy has developed, the environment has changed, there are excellent schools, and the healthcare sector has improved immensely and will continue to do so. Similarly, if you look at the projects in the pipeline, Dubai is going to be a very different city which in turn will have a greater effect on its ability to attract talent.</p><h4>What security will the bankruptcy law provide for the economy?</h4><p>A number of laws will follow the bankruptcy law in the UAE and these will be the platform required for the UAE to continue to perform as a major trading hub in the region. There is a vacuum here in the laws and regulations, but the positive thing about the UAE, and Dubai in particular, is that the key decision-makers are very aware of this. I forecast a legislative framework that will ensure that the UAE is enabled to emerge as a major economic hub in the region. Strictly looking at the short term, the bankruptcy law is not favorable, but at the same time it tells you is that you must pay your debts, pay your creditors, and pay your banks and suppliers, providing guidelines on how to conduct business in a honorable and honest way. We do not want people doing business in the UAE that have no intention of paying for goods and services and distorting the transparency of the UAE market. Businesses both large and small encounter challenges that have a very negative impact on cash flow, but if there are assets, income streams, and a solid business model then there is a case for keeping the company afloat. The law has provided two fundamental mechanisms to save such businesses: one mechanism is through a committee to help businesses restructure and the other mechanism is similar to Chapter 11 where you file for protection against your creditors. An owner can approach an agency with a strategy for repayment within a timeframe and ask for protection until this has been completed. The law will provide transparency and discipline in the market. As people become more familiar with this, there will be a greater amount of respect for the law. It will allow for creditors to be confident that they will get their money and for the debtors to have confidence in seeking their routes.</p><h4>What implications might VAT implementation have on your firm?</h4><p>There is one advantage of VAT and one advantage for taxes that I believe is extremely important for any economy, and that is a solid tax system means that every business must have well-kept accounts. This will help the UAE economy improve its transparency and ensure closer attention to corporate governance within organizations. This law will therefore enhance the sophistication of accounting for small and medium enterprises. The VAT is going to replace customs duty, so instead of paying the custom of the port, you are paying it at the cashier's desk.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>With the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore high speed rail (HSR) project finally close to initiation, are you ready to participate?</h4><p>Our past experience speaks for itself. Our air-rail link between Kuala Lumpur and the city's international airport (KLIA) was the first, and is still the only, HSR facility in Malaysia. We are fast, reliable, and safe, and we now have a solid 14-year track record of operating a world-class, award-winning service. Since 2002 we have been operating two lines, the KLIA Ekspres, which gets air travelers directly from KL to KLIA in 28 minutes (the quickest way to move between those two points), and the KLIA Transit for commuters, which stops at three intermediate stations. In August 2016 we transported our 75th millionth passenger. Our on-time performance for KLIA Ekspres is 99.7%, making us the second-best performing airport express operator in the world after Hong Kong Airport Express. If we were given the opportunity to be involved in the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore HSR, we would be more than ready. We actually mooted the idea in 2000, when we were still building our pioneer air-rail link. We already believed then that if we could launch and sustain an air-rail link, we would also be able to one day introduce HSR all the way to Singapore.</p><h4>Why do travelers continue to choose you when there are cheaper options for getting to the airport?</h4><p>Besides the speed, reliability and safety of our trains, connectivity is another big plus. We are well connected with other transit systems in Kuala Lumpur, especially via KL Sentral Station, where one can transfer easily to the Monorail, the LRT, the KTM Komuter and the soon to be launched MRT system. At Bandar Tasik Selatan Station, there is a large bus terminal for north, south, and eastbound intercity express buses out of Kuala Lumpur. The Bandar Tasik Selatan Station is also connected to the LRT Ampang Line and KTM Komuter. For travelers headed from KL Sentral Station to the airport, we have partnered with a number of airlines to provide flight check-in services at our in-town check-in facility at KL Sentral Station, the very few city check-in available in the world (less than 5). If you take Malaysia Airlines, Etihad Airways, or Cathay Pacific, you can check your luggage in at KL Sentral. We check in around 1,000 bags per day, and we have not lost a single piece of baggage in our 14 years of operations. We are always looking for strategic partnerships to enhance our passengers' journey. We are fortunate that one of our shareholders is a 4G network provider, and we were among the first train services to provide free Wi-Fi onboard. We collaborate with MasterCard on a marketing initiative and are in discussions with online travel agents such as Amadeus, and airlines such as Malaysia Airlines, AirAsia, and Malindo Air to offer ticketing solutions for their customers. Express Rail Link is part of the Global Air Rail Alliance, an organization that meets every year to discuss and share experiences in our industry. Besides the great travel advantages of speed and convenience that electric rail transport provides, we believe its environmental and infrastructural benefits are simply tremendous.</p><h4>In which segments have you seen passenger growth?</h4><p>Our core business has always been the KLIA Ekspres, which used to comprise 70% business travelers and 30% leisure. Our customer base has shifted in recent years with the leisure market now growing to around 45%. In 2014, we connected our lines to KLIA2, the new low-cost carrier terminal located 2km from KLIA. This extension brought an immediate 43% increase to our passenger numbers, showing that even budget travelers were prepared to pay MYR35 for a reliable service. The trains were congested as a result of our double-digit growth of 43% in 2014 and 20% in 2015. After 14 years in operation, the government finally allowed us to increase the KLIA Ekspres single fare to RM64. However, we decided to introduce an increase of RM55 instead, as we feel that the Malaysian market is not ready to accept the RM64 fare. We did see a small reduction in the number of passengers after our first-ever fare increase in January 2016 from MYR35 to MYR55 for a single trip from the airport to the city. We had anticipated this initial drop, and we are confident of bringing the numbers up again soon by delivering even higher levels of service to our passengers. We ordered six new trains from China to increase our capacity. They will begin operations in March 2017. In line with the new trains, we have plans to revamp our arrivals and departures Halls at KL Sentral Station to accommodate the increased traffic. We want to re-energize the space and give it a fresh update. Our arrival hall will also sport a new look as the area will integrate with MRT's pedestrian bridge linking to the Muzium Negara Station. Revamping work is currently underway and once the MRT starts operating, KL Sentral will be the one-stop center for seamless travel in the city.</p><h4>How has KLIA Transit benefited from the growth areas along the corridor, and vice versa?</h4><p>The KLIA Transit stops at three intermediate stations. Since our launch in 2002, there have been plenty of developments along the corridor, especially in and around Putrajaya, the administrative capital of Malaysia. Traffic through Putrajaya was initially low, but with the tremendous growth in the area and neighboring Cyberjaya—with its many multinational companies and universities—we have seen the number of passengers triple over the years. The area around Salak Tinggi Station was once an oil palm plantation, but it has seen rapid growth in recent years. There is now a large residential area around the station, and early this year the new Xiamen University Malaysia (its first branch campus outside of China) opened its doors. The connectivity factor via our transit line is definitely one of the reasons it opened there. We are happy that the stations we built have spurred growth in the surrounding areas.</p><h4>How has Express Rail Link evolved as an organization? </h4><p>We are proud not only of what we have achieved, but of the fact that we are able to show others the way. We started with a workforce dominated by foreign expertise, but we prioritized knowledge transfer and today the train and track maintenance workforce is 99% local. We have developed a high level of expertise in the HSR sector. The teams at our subsidiary ERL Maintenance Support (E-MAS) have worked as consultants on projects locally and internationally. E-MAS has consulted on the Suvarnabhumi Airport Railway Line in Bangkok as well as the Puerto Rico Light Rail Project. Since 2013, staff of ERL have supported operations at the Makkah Metro train, a service that runs seven days a year to cater to the surge of pilgrims during the Hajj season.</p><h4>What are your ambitions for the HSR connecting KL and Singapore?</h4><p>This has remained our greatest aspiration ever since we mooted the idea in 2000. But perhaps because of the sheer size of the project and the fact that it would entail a great deal of intergovernmental interaction, the country was only ready for it recently, when SPAD (the Land Public Transport Authority) was formed a few years ago and started a feasibility study. There is a lot work to be done on issues such as immigration, land use, and shared operations, however we are happy to note that MyHSR and the Singapore Land Transport Authority have been working hard on this. There will be an international open tender and we are definitely keen to participate. We are hopeful about our prospects in view of our expertise.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[One Step Forward]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[one-step-forward]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Bancolombia's strategy for implementing advanced technology in the Colombian market? </h4><p>My previous position with Bancolombia was as Head of Innovation. So I am aware of what is going on in terms of innovation and what is happening in the financial sector around the world. The financial sector is changing rapidly, but not just because of technology. Technology is making other changes possible, but people are also simply changing their behavior and their relationship with financial institutions. In the case of Bancolombia, we have been working on different ways of seeing our business since we started a new way of doing things in 2013, and we are convinced that this transformation to a digital model has to be aggressive. At the center of our strategy is customer experience and how we provide our customers with an experience where they really see how a financial institution can provide them with the products and services they need. Digital innovation and customer experience are central to the innovation strategy of Bancolombia.</p><h4>Do you have any innovations in the pipeline for 2017?</h4><p>We have several projects, one of which is our digital bank, which we have been working on for the past 18 months and for which a beta version is already on the market. What we are learning here is that it is really a new way of doing business. It is separate technology from the bank and a separate business model. Therefore, we see it as a laboratory in which we test concepts before going to the market and incorporating what we have learned in the process. It is a separate bank and is called "Nequi by Bancolombia." We are experimenting with the concept of a bank that is all digital and mobile with no branches is a new concept we are introducing, and we are learning a lot from our customers, which we will use to improve our services.</p><h4>How does Bancolombia's “Human Banking" concept translate into actual banking policy?</h4><p>We do more than live this concept—it is the foundation of how we conceive of banking: innovation and customer service that are based on people's experiences. This means the responsible design and sale of products that people actually need, as these are also the hallmarks of any sustainable institution. Yesterday Colombia's reputation ranking results were released by an organization called Merco, and Bancolombia was first on the list of 100 firms from every sector to be ranked. This means that our way of doing business is not just a slogan but our guide for doing business. We are a social actor in the economy, and we incorporate this into our business strategy each and every day. We are very proud because nowhere in the world is it easy or common for a bank to become the most reputable business in a country.</p><h4>What effect will the tax reform bill have upon the banking sector?</h4><p>The tax reform project is now public, and its central elements, from what we know so far, are good. In general, the reform is intended to promote investment and reduce the tax burden on corporations, which is good. In Colombia, it is not just the rates but the complexity of the tax code that hinders investment. In that sense, I think that what the Finance Minister presented to congress is good. It would increase the VAT, a positive step—but the question remains what Congress will do about it. We do not have much time to discuss the reform as it needs to be approved by the end of the year, but Colombia needs it for two reasons, because of fiscal considerations and investment promotion. It also presents some structural changes that would be beneficial for the Colombian economy.</p><h4>How would an accepted peace deal affect the finance sector?</h4><p>First of all, the result of the referendum was a surprise in general. With that in mind, the conversations that are taking place right now will end in a way that will be good for Colombia. The question is what is going to be agreed upon and when it's going to be signed. The sooner that happens the better. Because of the conflict, many regions in Colombia have not been a part of the economic development that the country has had over the past 15 or more years. Peace in Colombia will allow economic actors to enter previously untouched markets, many of which the government has also been absent from. For financial institutions like us with a large presence, we will have tons of new opportunities to enter completely new areas and sectors, especially when it comes to financing areas such as agriculture. This is going to be a huge opportunity for the country and will drive the country's economic development in the medium term. We are preparing to enter these areas and are looking for opportunities in rural sectors.</p><h4>What are your strategies for expanding the bank's international presence?</h4><p>We have a presence in three other major markets in Latin America after Colombia, namely Panama, El Salvador, and Guatemala. We are not planning any additional acquisitions, but do want to consolidate these operations. Our operations in Colombia are big and continue to grow as we bring new products and services into the market. We are also bringing our experience, products, and business ethic in Colombia to our markets in Panama, El Salvador, and Guatemala. There are opportunities in each of these markets for us to grown and change the way banking is being done in those markets.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the bank and the Colombian economy in 2017?</h4><p>We see 2017 as a year of transition. Growth forecasts are slightly higher than for 2016, though they will still be below our potential growth rate. As such, it will also bring opportunities for us banks and the economy in general. Infrastructure will also start to play a bigger role in 2017, as will exports. We are positive about 2017, but it is not going to be a year for big growth in Colombia. It is going to be a transition into 2018—then we will see bigger growth. We are very positive in general, and see that the Colombian economy continues to offer big opportunities to do business—and we are ready to take them.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[all-in-the-data]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the defining expertise of your firm, and could you elaborate on the types of training you provide?</h4><p>Pink Elephant is a premier provider of training on a broad range of IT skills. Technology changes the way organizations operate at a speed much faster than most people imagine. In five to 10 years, IT will be the most strategic asset of almost every organization. Technology-oriented and data-driven organizations are the business leaders of tomorrow because they are able to make faster and better decisions than their competitors. Pink Elephant provides the next generation IT leaders with the knowledge and skills to successfully lead digital transformation in their organizations, using globally accepted standards and best practices in IT. In order to keep up with the rapid advancements and technologies that change the ways in which businesses operate, organizations need to keep their skills up to date. A prime example would be how the adequate use of big data helps businesses develop a competitive advantage. Although big data is supported by relatively new technologies, only a few companies currently use this strategically to obtain new customers or launch new products and services. Pink Elephant teaches IT leaders how concepts like big data can have an impact on their organization and how they can make use of these technologies in their companies. With our programs, we aim to translate the knowledge of new technologies and methods into tangible results.</p><h4>Are Malaysians typically early adopters of new technologies and how do you adapt to the specifics of the Malaysian market?</h4><p>The Malaysian market is more oriented toward mobile technology and solutions in comparison with other Asian countries. For most Malaysians, their mobile phone is their primary interface with the world. Mobile technology greatly enhances the adoption of technology into corporation. Whereas most consumers primarily used technology privately, they now hold the same expectations from their employers, requesting innovative solutions in their workplace as well. Malaysia has become increasingly more tech savvy in the last five years. Additionally, the government plays a positive role in actively encouraging Malaysian companies to further develop the knowledge and skills of their IT staff. The Human Resource Development Fund (HRDF) actively encourages companies to send their employees for training every year, regardless of the economic climate and quarterly results. Other countries in the region could take Malaysia as an example of how to successfully drive economic empowerment by increasing the skills of the population.</p><h4>FinTech is often mentioned as the main challenge to the status quo in financial infrastructure. Does this reflect in the services you provide?</h4><p>Whether it is FinTech, BioTech, or smart citis, the main point is that new data-driven technologies are rapidly changing existing business models and reshaping the world. All these “disruptive" companies have one thing in common; they are completely driven by data and make the data-driven decision to outperform existing competitors. In the services Pink Elephant provides, we aim to show the possibilities that technology and IT best practices provide to gain a competitive advantage. Even though most of our clients are traditional multinationals in finance and oil and gas, they certainly see the need to innovate in order to remain in their leading positions. Big data, agile development, and service automation methods all contribute to fostering an innovative culture.</p><h4>How would you assess the climate of innovation in Malaysia? Is there a strong willingness to adopt new technologies?</h4><p>It is my strong belief that innovation—driven by knowledge and data—is the main driver for the advancement of countries. Especially for emerging economies, new technologies and innovative solutions help to improve quality of life. Not surprisingly, almost all new innovations are based on technologies and have a strong IT component. As we work with a great number of clients to improve their services, we see first hand the ambition of Malaysian organizations to deliver new and innovative solutions. Even though the current economic climate is challenging, most Malaysian companies are increasing their IT spending because they feel the need to innovate. The will to invest in IT solutions is strong, as companies realize they can gain a competitive advantage in the future there. The future belongs to those organizations that can successfully execute a digital transformation.</p><h4>What do you envision with your satellite offices in Hong Kong and Singapore? Are you eyeing further expansion in Southeast Asia and the Asia Pacific?</h4><p>We are always seeking to expand into other parts of the world, but only if we have a strong sense that we can contribute something meaningful to organizations and companies in that specific market. Because of the nature of our business, organizations need to have a basic level of IT maturity before we can add value. There is no point in launching big data or service automation projects in organizations that have basic infrastructural problems. Because of this, we started in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Kuala Lumpur as these all have advanced financial sectors, and now look to expand to Indonesia and the Philippines. In Jakarta, we see high growth numbers and a strong will to professionalize the country's IT sector.</p><h4>What are your ambitions and objectives for the years ahead?</h4><p>Our ambition is to become the leading brand for innovative IT education in Asia. We should be “top of mind" for organizations aspiring to obtain a competitive advantage through the use of IT technology. It is my personal ambition to ensure that every IT professional in Asia has a Pink Elephant certificate on their wall, showcasing that they are one of Asia's next-generation IT leaders.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Stout & About]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[stout-about]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of the Nigerian market for the overall strategy of Diageo in the West African region and for the whole continent?</h4><p>Diageo has four big markets in Africa. These are East Africa through East Africa Breweries, Nigeria through Guinness Nigeria, South Africa, and what we call the Africa Regional Markets (ARM), which includes big markets like Ghana, Cameroon, and Ethiopia. Nigeria is the largest single market within our Africa business. Today, the Africa business contributes approximately 14% to Diageo's annual turnover and Guinness Nigeria plays a big part in this. The Nigerian market is important because of its large, dynamic, and fairly young population. It is a strong and attractive market for both our alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages because of the positive demographics, and also because it is growing both in terms of its economy and population. We were predominantly a beer and soft drinks business, but now we have expanded into spirits. We are installing a new state-of-the-art line in our Benin City plant that will produce spirits locally, an investment of about GBP12 million. At the beginning of 2016, we also acquired distribution rights for Diageo's International Premium Spirits (IPS) brands such as Johnnie Walker, and brands like McDowell's from our India business United Spirits Ltd. (USL).</p><h4>How has the demand for Guinness products evolved in Nigeria over the last few years?</h4><p>The brewery in Lagos was the first ever to be built outside the British Isles for Guinness and since that was commissioned in Lagos in I962 the brand and the company have continued to enjoy a deep connection with Nigerians and Nigeria. The Guinness brand is still the strongest contributor to our turnover and profit with Guinness and Malta Guinness making up about 60% of the business. The rest is lager and other brands like Orijin and Harp. Our beer market has changed a bit with more consumers demanding lower-priced brands. Consumers are down trending, as the economy has become more challenging, so we have introduced brands to ensure we are able to compete in that segment. Over the past few years, innovation has contributed more than 50% to our YoY growth. Some of the innovations we have introduced in the last three years include Orijin, which is a contemporary bitters product. Guinness is one of our core brands and we have launched Guinness Africa Special, which has a slightly lower alcohol content and appeals to consumers who want less bitterness in their beer. We have other new brands in the pipeline as well.</p><h4>How would you characterize the role of Guinness Nigeria in the social and economic development of the country?</h4><p>Guinness has been associated with Nigeria for over 66 years. Since setting up our plant in Lagos in the early 1960s, we have really got involved in the community. We set up an eye hospital in Kaduna in northern Nigeria, one in the east in Onitsha, and another in Lagos. The other major area that is sometimes overlooked, but is really important, is the sourcing of raw materials. We source a significant portion of our raw materials locally and this contributes to growth in agricultural communities and puts cash back into the economy. Our goal is to source 75% of our total inputs locally by 2019. Guinness Nigeria employs about 1,000 people directly and another 2,000 under contracts. Through our distribution and retail network, we touch a significantly higher number of people in the workforce. Guinness has been a household name for a long time and we have operated in Nigeria at the highest standard. In 2015, we won an award for being one of the top-three Best Companies to Work for in Nigeria. This is an acknowledgment that we have been able to develop talent and also keep our employees engaged in a way that makes them feel we are adding value to their careers.</p><h4>How would you describe the business environment, especially in the manufacturing sector?</h4><p>The operating environment is tough because the economy is going through a challenging period given the low oil prices and the effects of currency fluctuations; however, as a business, Guinness Nigeria has invested in this country for the long term and as a long-term investor this is an attractive market. Nigeria has a large, young, and dynamic population; it is a resilient market that is also growing in terms of its population base and income. There are still many opportunities in whichever area you look at in terms of growing consumption. We believe there are still opportunities to grow the spirits segment of the business and on the soft drinks side, as well as the opportunity to provide more choice of beer products.</p><h4>Guinness Nigeria is on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE). What advantages does that bring?</h4><p>Listing on the stock exchange creates a number of advantages for us. First of all, Diageo as an international company generally wants to be associated with local companies that have strong roots in the community and society they operate in. So listing is one of the ways of allowing local shareholders to participate in the progress and prosperity of the business. Guinness Nigeria has been listed for a long time and this allows local retail investors, including our employees, to participate and own part of the company. It also means that we can share with the local exchange our commitment to operating to the highest standards both locally and internationally and also allows us to be able to raise capital when necessary and this can be very helpful to us.</p><h4>What can the government do to further support the manufacturing industry in Nigeria?</h4><p>Power is one area where improvements would enable industry to do business more easily. Without reliable power the interruptions to production and to our retailers are significant. Then there is the issue of government policies and making sure that these are more consistent and predictable so we can plan for the future. The regulatory requirements need to be clarified, especially for importing and exporting goods, and there also needs to be more cohesion between the ministries otherwise the layers of policy at the state and federal levels can be confusing for businesses and can prove challenging to comply with where these are not fully transparent.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In which areas has the ministry been working over the past two years?</h4><p>The MOPT is important for the country. The MOPT has five assigned councils of which the Minister is the president of the board of directors. These entities include the National Council for Highway Administration (CONAVI), the Technical Council of Civil Aviation (CETAC), the Public Transport Council (CTP), the Road Safety Council (COSEVI), and the National Council of Concessions (CNC).  We are conducting important negotiations to update a few studies of transit demand for a concession that is going to be taken again, stretching from San Jose to Cartago. Some smaller ports located in Golfito are undergoing updated studies between other projects under construction. The CTP has two important projects, one of which is focused on eliminating many cars in downtown San Jose and improving the public transport system in order to lower congestion down town. Another project is an electronic payment system, which could potentially enable users to pay with cards while allowing us to obtain information through the system and observe the behavior related to the tariff regime. The project of access to the Moin terminal has already begun. It was awarded to Meco and Puentes y Calzadas Infraestructuras, a Spanish company, and was signed for USD71 million. CONAVI has around 5,500km of surfaced roads and 3,000km of unpaved roadways. Curiously, in this country we have one of the densest road networks in Latin America. CONAVI is now implementing a program of road infrastructure financed by BID for USD300 million. CONAVI also has extremely important projects, such as the construction of the Cañas-Liberia road to connect Pozuelo to Jardines del Recuerdo in Heredia, the road in San Carlos, and other key access points. The previously mentioned projects of the program are already in the process of receipts. Aside from this, CONAVI also takes on other projects with the Central American Bank of Economic Integration (BCIE), including projects such as the north beltway and other works similar to the Cañas road. COSEVI has plans for road safety, the construction of new bridges and pedestrian steps, and road education. COSEVI is an important council for the country, but is perhaps a tad invisible because it occupies a greater role in media reporting. No less important is this ministry, and we will soon begin on the PIT, a USD450 million transport infrastructure program financed by BID.</p><h4>Besides infrastructure, what do you consider to be the main challenge in Costa Rica?</h4><p>Here, we have a lot of potential, requirements, and also competent people; however, there are many hobbles, and we have to look for a country solution. We have an excess of controls that at times delay the execution of works. It is these kinds of constraining conditions that need to be overcome, so we have been identifying laws and decrees to improve ourselves. At the national level, it is a big task that we have as Costa Ricans, because the country has great potential for investments. Under these conditions, however, investors lose interest in Costa Rica. Then it becomes necessary to make adjustments in order to be more competitive.</p><h4>What are some of the ministry' goals for next year?</h4><p>There are significant projects to be executed that will be tendered next year, such as the San Jose-San Ramon road, which is an important road for the country. Equally, the road to Limon province has already been awarded to a Chinese company, which will be in charge of the construction of a 100km extension. We are going to have many projects in 2017, and the intention is not to paralyze the work in a future transition of government.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Health and education represent to crucial pillars of Tanzanian's social and economic development strategy. What programs could Finland implement in Tanzania to improve education and healthcare in the East African country?</h4><p>Until 2015 Finland's major contribution to financing education and healthcare was through providing general budget support to Tanzania. We are glad that important results have been achieved in these sectors, in particular what comes to broadening access to primary education. Finland is known for having a highly-ranked education system. We would be happy to share our educational expertise with Tanzania and other African countries. Finland can provide solid expertise on, for example, teacher education, including technical and vocational education, curriculum development, and digitalization. In Finland almost all young students who finish their compulsory education after secondary school continue to studies. Vocational education is an attractive education sector in Finland as almost half of those youngsters choose vocational education. This sector is developed in close cooperation between the public and private sectors in order to improve the skills of the workforce, to respond to skills needed in the world of work and to support lifelong learning.</p><h4>President Magufuli's ambition is to transform Tanzania from being an aid recipient to a stand-alone economy. How is Finland helping Tanzania to achieve such a transformation?</h4><p>We think Tanzania stands a good chance of being successful in this transformation. Finland is very supportive in these important efforts. Over the past decade sub-Saharan Africa has been one of the fastest growing areas of the world. Despite decreasing commodity prices the economic growth rate will remain well above the average growth rate in Europe. Tanzania has boosted its revenue collection significantly to reduce aid dependency. Finland stands ready to support Tanzania to build sustainable systems for revenue and tax collection. We are in discussions with the Tanzania revenue authority about how Finland could support these efforts together with other development partners, many of whom already are participating for example in TRA's Tax Modernization Programme. The success of the transformation will ultimately depend on Tanzania maintaining its sound macroeconomic policies for supporting growth and generating employment for people, especially for the growing youth population. We see a lot of action taken and support the government in efforts to improve public governance, fiscal management, and domestic revenue, which are all critical elements in the process to transforming the country. The creation of employment and livelihoods is one main element of Finland's collaboration in Tanzania. Finland will concentrate its efforts on two areas, the national innovation system and forestry. Both of them are identified by the Tanzanian Five Year Development Plan II as priorities for national development, forestry having a close link to the national action against climate change. They are also areas which will benefit from Finland's experience and know-how. To boost the economic development in developing countries the Finnish government has also decided to increase funding for public investment, creating a supportive environment for economic growth. This will help the private sector to generate economic growth itself. The Finnish government has also allocated over EUR500 million for new funding for this effort during this cabinet's four-year term. Our new Public Sector Investment Facility (PIF) will be launched later this year. PIF will provide subsidized loans to public entities in developing countries, enabling investments that deal with key development challenges. These could include investments in electricity distribution, water treatment, and sanitation as well as education and health-related hardware and software. Our national development finance institution Finnfund, which invests in the private sector in developing countries, will this year have additional funding amounting to EUR130 million. We also continue to strengthen our innovation partnership program BEAM and our business partnership program Finnpartnership. The aim of these initiatives is to help private business in developing countries with the capital, technology, and networks that they need in order to be successful and add jobs, wealth, and tax revenue, to name some of the key development effects.</p><h4>Magufuli's vision to industrialize the country as well as his war on corruption will help Tanzania become a more business-friendly economy. How can the Finnish private sector cooperate with the Government of Tanzania to boost local economic development?</h4><p>Finland has a lot of expertize in forestry, energy, mining, geospatial technology, clean technology, and innovation. We are keen to strengthen our commercial partnerships with Tanzania. The know-how of the Finnish private sector will be an important asset for strengthening links between Tanzania and the global economy. Finnish programs can facilitate the Tanzanian private sector's access to global value chains, markets, capital, and technology. Finnish-Tanzanian business partnerships can support Tanzania's development for instance through better and/or cheaper products, improved efficiency, technology transfer, investment, and exports. Finland supports private sector development and engagement in developing countries. All stakeholders, being beneficiaries of Finnish funding, shall operate in a responsible and sustainable manner in accordance with the universal principles of the United Nations Global Compact and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.</p><h4>What are the major short-term goals regarding Tanzania-Finnish bilateral relations as of year-end 2017?</h4><p>While strengthening the commercial ties between our countries, we continue to pursue the objectives of our development cooperation programs. We aim for instance at supporting the improved performance of the public sector, focusing on better public financial management (PFM) systems, which are crucial for macro-economic stability and effective use of resources for poverty reduction and sustainable development. Sustainable economic growth, social welfare, and environmental protection are among the issues that Tanzanian leaders must address now and in the future. To support sound leadership, Finland will continue to partner with the UONGOZI Institute which builds competencies of current and emerging leaders in Africa on leadership, executive management, policy development, and strategic thinking. Regarding the private sector, access to finance is one of the key bottlenecks for innovative growth-oriented companies in Tanzania. In order to ease the situation, Tanzania is developing a national system for funding innovation through the National Fund for Science and Technology (NFAST) based at the National Commission for Science and Technology (Costech). Finland is currently initiating a second phase of a program that intends to support this effort through technical assistance and financial contributions. In the forestry sector, Finland will support the private sector and local communities to manage and utilize sustainable forests and to establish forest plantations. At the moment, only about 15% of the land has official title deeds or land-use plans and open access to forests results in depletion of land and deforestation. Therefore, the bilateral programs will also support land-use planning and strengthen the forest administration and forest NGOs. This will also contribute to the fight against the illegal timber trade.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Bhatia began operating in 1969 in the UAE. With almost 50 years of operation, what do you consider to be its main achievements?</h4><p>The company's achievements are parallel to the country's achievements. We had the privilege of being able to establish ourselves before the union, and we have seen the advantages of the country coming together and the vision of every different Emirate becoming one country's vision. We forayed into logistics in terms of distribution networks and warehousing structures to support international brands and companies entering the UAE and at the same time being a hub for using neighboring or developing regions, such as Africa. A lot people say that the UAE is becoming the center of the world, but I believe it already is the center of the world. Whether it is from land, sea, or air, I do not know of any other country that has more than one different national airline, for example. In terms of sea ports there are new developments, such as Abu Dhabi's Khalifa Port, which is one of the largest ports in the region. And now with the new cruise terminal, connectivity is going to be enhanced throughout the Emirates. We are providing services to the port and for the cruise terminals in terms of logistics, distribution, retail, and the F&amp;B industry.</p><h4>The company has a diversified portfolio including wholesale, retail, and logistics, as well as hospitality. Which sector do you consider to be at the core of your business?</h4><p>Retail, logistics, and distribution are at the core of our business. The F&amp;B side and hospitality are the complimentary sides of our business. We have been venturing into real estate management more recently and are slowly expanding.</p><h4>Are you planning to expand, both in the UAE and internationally?</h4><p>We expanded to Abu Dhabi last year and are considering expanding into the Far East and Africa. We tend to partner with strong local players that have established themselves in the countries where we go for a long period of time. We pick those partners based on their local knowledge, because we have the business acumen and the business know-how, and we just need the local domestic, political, or just general day-to-day operational know-how. We try to create plug-and-play operations.</p><h4>Are you also planning to start online shopping?</h4><p>Yes, e-commerce is the next step we want to take. It would complement our current retail structure. We would like to target a niche market, or a slightly different e-commerce element to what everyone else is doing here.</p><h4>Sharjah is expected to experience rapid growth in the next five years. What is your forecast for Bhatia in the next couple of years?</h4><p>We like to refer to ourselves as a conservative business house, and that is why most of the financial and government segments see us as a worthy investment. We are a company that understands our limitations and our strengths. We take calculated risks; we only do what we are good at and we do not try to do what everyone else does simply because they are making a lot of money. Obviously considering the decline in industry at the present moment, we are conservative about how much exposure we want to take, but that being said our international growth is going to substitute for what we might be losing in the UAE at present. I think we will almost be on par with the double-digit growth we have seen in the past five or six years.</p><h4>What are Bhatia's goals and priorities for 2016?</h4><p>Our goal is to expand into these new markets using the UAE as our hub. We are negotiating to bring in new products and categories to the UAE market for both duty free and domestic distribution. At the same time, we are taking a lot of interest in expanding our expertise outside, such as the Far East and Africa. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What characteristics make Sharjah such an ideal hub for social and corporate events?</h4><p>Sharjah holds the unique position of being the cultural hub, not only of the UAE, but also of the region, winning several Islamic and International awards to support it. Choosing to focus on that strength, impact, and demand for cultural interests made Sharjah distinctive in terms of the variety of events, businesses, and organizations that it cultivates. Under the nurturing care and close supervision of its Ruler HRH Sheikh Dr. Sultan bin Mohammed Al Qasimi, you can see how over the past decades Sharjah has flourished—no matter what the field of knowledge, in reading, education, art, museums, or festivals­—it has positioned itself in a way that is very different to the other Emirates. It delivered something truly worth investing in and, with the vision of this leader, keeps going from one height to another, making sure to raise the bar. Aside from international titles the Emirate has won, Sharjah has also claimed international recognition for many of its annual events, such as the Sharjah International Book Fair, the Sharjah International Film Festival, and the Sharjah Light Festival, to name a few. Then you have its significant location, connecting the two parts of the Emirates, with Dubai and Abu Dhabi on one side, and then the four eastern Emirates on the other; Sharjah is pretty much in the middle, serving as a main artery in the anatomy of the country.</p><h4>Into which specific segments are you planning to expand?</h4><p>When we launched the JRCC we anticipated a 4-1 ratio in terms of social to corporate events hosted. This expectation was based on the demand of the market and lack of options, as people were literally lined up outside the door to book their weddings and social events before the construction even finished. That being said, weddings tend to occur on weekends so there are only three days available for clients to book for weddings, since only a small percentage of people are willing to have it any other day. This means that we have five days of the week for corporate events, which would naturally indicate room to improve the anticipated ratio. As we have continued to pull in more corporate clients we have lifted this ratio to 7-3, so the corporate functions have now increased, which means that the occupancy rates have increased in general. We remain focused on social events of course; they are our bread and butter, but at the same time we look to invest heavily in the right balance. Our focus in 2016 will be to strengthen our name in the corporate market and work more toward being the business hub and the “it" event venue for any kind of MICE event, the same way we have  successfully established it for social ones.</p><h4>What are the opportunities that you see to host meetings during Dubai Expo 2020?</h4><p>It is common knowledge that the Emirate of Dubai is investing heavily to ensure it can cater to the enormous demand that Expo 2020 is creating. The officials there expect to open over 100 new hotels just to cater to the delegations received and for over AED89 billion of business to be exchanged, and this will create many opportunities for us. The expo will not just enhance Dubai but the entire Emirates. As a neighboring Emirate, we will get a slice of the clients, visitors, and partners who choose to stay in Sharjah, or host their events here. We want to ensure that we are ready by 2020 and have taken our business to the next level in terms of the services scope that we are offering. We will be ready to cater to any kind of requirements. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does the department work to preserve and promote cultural heritage?</h4><p>Following the vision of His Highness Sheikh Dr. Sultan bin Mohammad Al Qasimi, we preserve and promote cultural heritage through permanent displays and temporary exhibitions, our annual program for children and families, and various activities such as workshops, seminars, and lectures. Each museum initiative is designed to incorporate the full range of activities and can be both historical—or tradition-focused—or dedicated to current issues such as environment and ecology, which have an impact on our cultural heritage.</p><h4>Do you partner with any international organizations to exhibit items from abroad?</h4><p>At the moment, we are cooperating on an international exhibition with the Museum of Applied Arts in Budapest. It has a wonderful historical textile collection and we seek to bring a unique selection to Sharjah. At the same time, we have just been invited to Belgrade to look at museums there, so there might be something that we will bring from that part of the world in the near future. In general, SMD has collaborated with international museums since its establishment, and such intercultural dialog is an integral part of our work.</p><h4>What are some of the festivals the department has managed?</h4><p>We recently had a successful Aquarium Festival that focused on the environment and ecological issues. Apart from performances, music, and food, it exhibited artwork made from trash that was salvaged from the sea. We also just completed our Science Carnival, sponsored by the Mohammed bin Rashid Smart Learning Program in Dubai. We have special celebrations dedicated to international days, such as Autism Awareness Day and Earth Hour. On World Turtle Day we released rescued turtles from our aquarium to highlight the importance of the conservation of turtles, particularly those close to becoming extinct. In the UAE, we have the Hawksbill turtle, whose environment is being threatened by poor waste management and construction developments on the coast. We find many turtles with garbage stuck on their shells, limiting their ability to swim, or stuck in fishing nets. We take care of them and make sure they are healthy before releasing them back into the ocean.</p><h4>What are your goals and priorities for the year ahead?</h4><p>Our priorities are to always keep moving forward with the best services we can provide, and we want to ensure we are in line with the strategic objectives of the Emirate of Sharjah as a whole. The most important thing for us is access to our museums, and not just physical access but intellectual access, so that people are really able to enjoy what we have to offer. We are always trying to find ways for people to engage with our museums and our collections and for them to enjoy a day in our museum without feeling they do not belong here or that it is too difficult to understand. In that respect, we even provide Braille for blind visitors in some of our venues. We have also been involved in many projects including sign language courses for our guides. Providing appropriate services remains a challenge, because every year one realizes that there are more and more issues related to access to museums. Sometimes it is finances, so we have to think about promoting our museum through free days or special promotions. From an intellectual point of view, one needs to make sure that more difficult topics, such as physics, for example, are made easier for people to understand and find ways to demonstrate concepts so visitors do not always have to learn by reading. Then it is necessary to think about people who cannot see and how they might interact with the objects, or people who cannot hear well. There are many different ways that people can interact with things and understand them, and it is important to constantly improve on this. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the authority working to encourage investment in the creative industries?</h4><p>In 1979, HH Sheikh Dr. Sultan Bin Muhammad Al Qasimi, Member of the Supreme Council and Ruler of Sharjah, announced his strategy for Sharjah: building humanity through culture, art, and education. Since then, the Emirate has been progressively developing its human resources and expanding its knowledge capacity. In over 37 years of development, Sharjah has prioritized learning and knowledge acquisition and, through its offerings, the Sharjah Book Authority (SBA) has been a key facilitator of education, entertainment, and business growth. An assessment of the Sharjah International Book Fair (SIBF), with its 1.5 million visitors each year and total sales of USD50 million, reveals the expansion in the publishing market. Last year more than 1,265 publishers from 69 countries around the world participated in the fair, making it the third-largest book fair in the world. In 2012, the value of books exported and imported was USD260 million. SIBF by itself facilitated between USD40 to USD50 million of this in direct sales or in agreements signed.</p><h4>Innovation is something important for the Authority. What initiatives have you launched of note?</h4><p>Last year we launched our advertising for SIBF 2016, with one component being a simple blank red page in newspapers that had glasses with red lenses attached. By wearing the glasses the reader could see a hidden message on the page. This innovative form of marketing had a significant impact, both in the UAE and overseas, creating a lot of interest in the fair. One of our main initiatives has been to expand SBA's presence abroad. SBA representatives have flown the Sharjah flag at literature fairs and events in Mexico, Japan, China, Sweden, South Africa, the US, Argentina, Russia, India, Germany, and Turin in Italy, which hosts Europe's largest book fair. Our promotional activities have helped Sharjah transform from a business networking only environment to being a hub for the publishing industry. One particular SBA innovation of note was the launch of the digital publication “Baba Zayed," which is available in Arabic and English. Baba Zayed is the first book of its kind in the world that uses 3D VR Glasses to enable children to read and at the same time enjoy 360-degree interaction with the story. We are utilizing the latest developments for expanding knowledge by recapturing youngsters' joy for books with the adoption of new and exciting interactive formats.</p><h4>What is the potential for Sharjah Publishing City?</h4><p>Sharjah Publishing City is the first-of-its-kind venture in the world. Its tax-free status means that if offers huge potential for anyone working in the publishing industry who is keen to set up a business in the region. We have many clients keen to take up tenancy in the free zone, which is scheduled to open in February 2017. The best way of viewing the venture is to see it as a “United Nations for books." Sharjah Publishing City will host individuals, companies, and organizations from around the world and will act as a focal point for people to communicate, network, and build relationships.</p><h4>Can you tell us about the Sharjah library?</h4><p>Sharjah Public Library was founded by Sheikh Sultan bin Saqr Al Qasimi in 1925 under the name Al Qasimiyah Library, with the facility initially serving as his private archive. It became public when he opened it up for citizens who were keen to read and further their knowledge. The library's location has changed several times over the years, moving from Al Husn (Sharjah Fort) in Bait Al Gharbi under the Mudeef Building to Sharjah City Municipality, then to Africa Hall and then to Sharjah Cultural Centre and Sharjah University City. SBA has partnered with the American Library Association (ALA), which was established in 1876 and is the oldest organization for libraries in the world. The only ALA conference for librarians held outside the US is conducted at SIBF Sharjah. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess 2015 in terms of overall tourism activity?</h4><p>Tourism figures have mainly been positive, although we have had to balance gains in guests against an unprecedented drop in hotel guests from Russia due to reasons beyond our control. The depreciation of the ruble against the dollar drove outbound tourism down from Russia and the CIS, one of our key source markets. We did not, however, neglect the Russian market and still participated in exhibitions and roadshows there. Nonetheless, we focused our investments on our most promising new source markets of India, China, and continued strong investment in the existing markets of the GCC. The Chinese market has great potential as Chinese tourists again topped the list of global outbound travelers internationally. In 2015, we saw a 45% increase in the number of Chinese hotel guests in comparison to 2014. However, in 2014, we saw a 140% increase in the number of Chinese hotel guests to Sharjah compared to the previous year. Sharjah International Airport has had an amazing year, and Air Arabia flies to Urumqi, which is the closest Chinese city to the Emirates. The Madrid-based World Tourism Organization's latest report says the travel trend now is different—it is experiential. The Sharjah tourist products fit this well as travelers want to experience something of the culture and traditions of the UAE, and want to know about our heritage. Travelers have had their fill of shopping malls and modern life; they want culture and Sharjah is all about an authentic cultural experience.</p><h4>SCTDA also aims to attract more than 28 cruise ships with 72,000 tourists to Khor Fakkan Port in the current season. What strategy are you following to achieve it?</h4><p>We are part of the Cruise Arabia Alliance, which includes Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, Oman, Doha, and Bahrain, and we regularly receive cruise line businesses. To maximize cruise visits, it is important to develop the whole region as a destination and not only one port, as cruise ships will not come for one port; they will come for seven, eight, or 10 cities. We have seen positive gains working with the alliance. We also participate in many international events. We also have great relations with companies like Costa and MSC, and I have been to Genoa to their headquarters to facilitate and create programs for them on the east coast. The cruise industry continues to offer good potential; however, in order to grow, we need to invest more in the east coast in terms of ensuring economic opportunities for engagement. We look forward to the new Chedi hotel opening, which, like the one in Muscat, will offer 100 villas on a mountain with its own private beach. </p><h4>How would you evaluate Sharjah's progress toward reaching its Vision 2021 target of 10 million tourists?</h4><p>Sharjah continues to develop new accommodation stock and the opening of the new five-star Sheraton at the end of 2015 is recognition of this. With room numbers increasing to match demand and the quality of the offering being upgraded through our rigorous inspections and grading criteria along with a newly developed initiative called Marhabtain and ongoing investment in the tourism product, we are confident of meeting our target. Marhabtain, which is a welcoming expression that we use in Arabic, has three levels of hospitality training for hotels. It is challenging here in Sharjah as there are many hotels that are family-owned. We monitor an index through a company in the Netherlands specialized in guest experiences. We review online comments from 220 websites around the world 24 hours a day, seven days a week, so that any negative comment can be noted for immediate action with the hotel to ensure that the services improve. I have been in the government now for almost 15 years, and the last two years—especially last year—have been unbelievable. The number of events and things happening in Sharjah on a daily basis is incredible. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How was 2015 for AUS? What have been your main achievements?</h4><p>The 2015-2016 academic year was one of growth and development for the university in many areas. In particular, it was a year of defining strategic research goals. AUS has developed a strategic research plan, developed additional academic programs, and defined a new position for a Chief Research Officer. As part of that vision, HH Sheikh Dr. Sultan passed an amiri decree establishing the Research, Technology and Innovation (RTI) Park as a Free Zone Authority for research and innovation. The RTI Park will provide an environment for research, innovation, and creativity, as well as support, encourage, and develop synergy with research and academic programs at AUS, and help promote Sharjah as a global research and technology hub. Since its inception, AUS has been committed to academic excellence. We keep enhancing our curriculum in sync with international economic and social developments and the demands of the marketplace. Our board of trustees has approved the university's first two PhD programs in engineering and business administration. The board has also granted approval for a new master's degree in biomedical engineering, which is a collaborative program between our College of Engineering and College of Arts and Sciences. On the undergraduate front, we have received board approval for bachelor's degree programs in physics and in psychology.</p><h4>Do you find that the university's achievements have been able to move beyond the immediate academic environment to having an impact in the real world?</h4><p>AUS is committed to making sure that the knowledge and expertise imparted in the classroom have a bearing on the “real world." We place great emphasis on critical thinking and problem solving. Earlier this year, along with the Mohammed bin Rashid Space Centre (MBRSC), AUS announced the completion of the design and building of the communication nanosatellite, Nayif-1. The UAE's first nanosatellite was developed by Emirati engineering students from AUS under the supervision of a team of engineers and specialists from MRBSC within the framework of a partnership between our two institutions, aiming to provide hands-on experience to engineering students in satellite manufacturing. We hope this association will go a long way to providing skilled individuals equipped with the wherewithal to support national and regional development.</p><h4>How is the university building relationships with other international institutions and are you working to attract foreign investment to your university?</h4><p>Our goal is to become the leading research university in the region, and developing strong bonds with international institutions is an integral part of our vision. Central to the university's values is the goal set by HH Sheikh Dr. Sultan, wherein AUS is committed to becoming linked with the economic, cultural, and industrial sectors of society. For such a collaboration to become meaningful, it is essential that arenas of cooperation are extended beyond our immediate environment. Therefore, from the very inception, AUS has always reached out to other reputed international institutions of higher education and has established relationships with them at various levels and in a wide variety of fields.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Sharjah over the next five years?</h4><p>Under the guidance and leadership of HH Sheikh Dr. Sultan, the Emirate has earned renown for its distinct cultural identity and as a center of world-class academic institutions. These are exciting times for Sharjah as it undertakes some dynamic projects in sync with its long-term development plans. The Emirate's GDP is growing rapidly every year. Its manufacturing sector is one of the most important ones in the region with some 20 industrial zones and two thriving free-trade zones. It is also important to note that the Emirate is one of the few diverse economies in the region wherein no one sector represents more than 20% of GDP. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did the Sharjah Healthcare City (SHCC) come about, and how has it developed the healthcare sector in the region?</h4><p>In accordance with the vision of HH Dr. Sheikh Sultan Bin Mohammed Al Qassimi, Member of the Supreme Council and Ruler of Sharjah, to transform the Emirate into a regional healthcare hub, the decision was made to launch a healthcare city where healthcare and related activities from the world are allowed. The SHCC was formed in March 2012 and will cover about 2.5million sqm, with the primary phase to be developed being over 500,000sqm. The SHCC will be located beside Sharjah International Airport.</p><h4>What are the main advantages for investors now that SHCC operates as a free zone?</h4><p>The SHCC operates as a free zone and thus investors can enjoy 100% ownership of their entity, zero tax and duties, 100% repatriation of capital and profits, single-window service, hassle-free licensing, world-class infrastructure, and so on. In fact, investors are not required to meet with any other external agencies as all approvals, including the FZ company registration and licensing, leasing of facilities, facility licensing, professional licensing, and so on, will be done by the Sharjah Health Authority.</p><h4>It is estimated that the healthcare sector will grow 9.3% between 2012 and 2018. How do you assess the current level of healthcare in the region?</h4><p>With the growing population of Sharjah and the adjoining Emirates, which is expected to reach 2.7 million by 2025, there is an acute need for more healthcare facilities and the overall healthcare industry is expected to grow considerably in the region. Setting up specialized surgery centers, cancer centers, advanced diagnostics, rehab centers, cardiac care centers, and neurology centers, which are currently limited or lacking, represents an excellent opportunity for investors. The scope of healthcare-related investments in the region is enormous. The demand for hospital beds across the GCC is expected to rise, with the UAE registering the highest projected growth in demand for hospital beds at 160% by 2025. By 2020, the GCC may require in excess of 25,000 additional beds with the current level of care.</p><h4>What's your strategy in terms of attracting FDI to the SHCC?</h4><p>The SHCC heavily promotes the investment opportunities available among the targeted healthcare community across the globe. Various ways of bilateral cooperation are under discussion with other countries as well. Currently, we are focused on developing the primary phase comprising half a million sqm, which will have clinical-office buildings, small and medium hospitals, and rehab centers along with world-class infrastructure and single window administrative support. Upon completion of the primary phase Sharjah will house a variety of healthcare facilities and our future strategy is to engage in health tourism with the proximity of two excellent international airports.</p><h4>What are your goals and targets for the year ahead?</h4><p>We expect to complete the master plan this year with a detailed infrastructure study. Construction of both a clinical building and an office tower are also expected to commence by the end of the year. Land leasing is expected to commence by next year. We aim to attract to the SHCC from the beginning: large and medium-sized hospitals, single and multi-doctor clinics, traditional healing centers, healthcare centers, laboratories, biotechnology research centers, yoga and wellness centers, spas, counseling centers, rehabilitation centers and representative offices, storage and trading of medical-related equipment and disposables, and housing units and hospitality centers. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>K&amp;A started as an architectural firm and later diversified into other sectors such as energy and transport. Do you plan to further expand your business lines?</h4><p>The founders of K&amp;A did not want to depend on just one sector in our business, so from the start the vision was to expand beyond architecture. They proved to be correct, based on our sustainable presence and growth over the years. We ventured into environmental engineering and transportation, partnering with American and European firms, leveraging their expertise, and eventually becoming independent and quickly growing into those fields. Later, every few years we expanded into other sectors, and that expansion continues today. We just completed a three-year restructuring of our company whereby our expansion has become more formalized and integrates and unifies all the offices under a new structure.</p><h4>How do your operations in the US compare to doing business in this region?</h4><p>Our business in the US was difficult, slow, and not as successful as we had hoped, and as such we are undergoing a complete reorganization. As for our other offices in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman, the UAE, and North Africa, we are well established; we opened the Syria office in 1995, before the troubles started. However, we are currently involved in certain projects in Damascus, though we operate from Beirut and not Syria. We have three offices in Palestine in Ramallah, Nablus, and Gaza. The first two are doing relatively fine, and projects there continue. As for the one in Gaza, the siege and lack of construction materials have created a deadlock, so everything is on hold. We have heard things will improve and that aid will come from other countries and institutions, so we hope things there will move forward soon. Our Egypt operation now employs around 800 people and the business and prospects look good and promising. We also opened a new office in India last year as well as new offices in Africa; Gabon opened in 2012, Mozambique in 2015, and we will also have an office in Ethiopia. We have our sights set on Africa and expect good progress there.</p><h4>Expo 2020 has resulted in more hotels being built in Sharjah to accommodate the expected influx. Will those hotels and other buildings benefit Sharjah in the long run?</h4><p>It will benefit Sharjah if tourism sector activities increase. Otherwise, we run the risk of having low occupation rates. With added activities and promotion of tourism in Sharjah, those hotels can become busier after the Expo. The biggest benefit will be seen in Dubai. However, Sharjah is extending great effort to expand its tourism sector, with initiatives such as the promotion of heritage tourism in the desert, for example.</p><h4>What are your priorities and goals for the coming few years?</h4><p>We have many objectives. We are ranked 39th in the top-200 ENR Consulting companies worldwide; however, our goal is to improve this ranking. We are also rated among the top-10 consulting firms in the Middle East region. Our goal is to increase our overall revenue and work on our new reorganization to strengthen our capabilities and give our staff the chance to build and enhance their skills and capabilities to better meet clients' needs and serve them. Our clients' interests are crucial to our business, and we always ask them how we can improve our services and what we can do better to fully meet their expectations. We have annual revenues of around USD400 million, and we want to expand that further in the coming years. A great deal of this also depends on what happens in the region. Egypt, for example, is a big market with plenty of potential. Overall, the outlook is promising. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Tilal City was inaugurated at the end of 2014. Where does the project stand now, and how will it help meet Sharjah's growing demand for property?</h4><p>Tilal City is the first project of a joint venture between the government of Sharjah and Iskan Real Estate Development-Tilal Properties. Forging a partnership with the government was aimed at ensuring that quality projects are delivered. This was the first project in Sharjah that was guaranteed a 100-year lease hold for non-Arab UAE residents as per the Sharjah Executive Council's orders. People are really connected to the UAE and prefer to stay here for the many advantages that the country offers. Arab nationals stay and live here more than 40-50 years in general. There has always been a demand for such a project, which gives buyers the confidence and security to stay here long term. Tilal City was the only project at the time listed for freehold for UAE's Arab expats and GCC nationals, which is also significant. What makes it special is its convenient location, the facilities, the payment, and financing models and plans—basically everything about this project is unique and innovative for Sharjah, and it has the government's backing, which provides further security to the market and landowners.</p><h4>How would you assess the overall state of the property market in Sharjah?</h4><p>There are many projects in place right now, all led by joint venture companies, and this is because the future of Sharjah is no longer about small and individual realtors, but about prominent real estate and property companies. The government has been working with renowned companies to supply the market with quality projects like Tilal City. This indicates a greater growth and vision for Sharjah in the coming years. The government targets stable and consistent growth for the city while prioritizing needs of end users in terms of offering stable and secure investment opportunities in Sharjah, too. The government also wants to prevent inflation and keep the market under control so that it does not overheat. The government has been playing a great role in assigning good plots, supporting developers with good infrastructure, and providing legal and financial backing, guarantees, and security. The government is also paying much more attention to creating a more beautiful and harmonious city, focusing on how projects fit in aesthetically and blend with public spaces and the population at large. For example, of the 25 million sqft in Tilal City, we reserved 12 million sqft, almost 48% of the project, for public services. In that regard, it is not just a closed and walled-off space for private residents here; a lot of it is open to the public and blends in with the rest of the city. This is unprecedented in Sharjah, where it is unusual for a developer to dedicate more than 20% of a project to public spaces. We also have a theme for every zone, and that is in line with the government's vision to create a certain mood and feel for the city so that these projects can then fit in harmoniously with the rest of the city.</p><h4>What are your targets for the next three years?</h4><p>Recently we held an open day that attracted a good number of investors. Our next target is the announcement of Tilal Mall, which will be one of the biggest shopping malls in Sharjah. We want it to be a destination in itself, with a four-star hotel, many shops, and all sorts of other amenities. After that, we are looking at Tilal Residence and also Tilal Industrial, which will be an industrial city. There is very good demand for an industrial city here in Sharjah, with a few districts being converted from residential to commercial or industrial areas already. In the coming five years we foresee huge demand for more industrial plots, and that is what we are targeting with Tilal Industrial. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[strong-fundamentals]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How successful has Al Zahia been in attracting investors' interest, and how does the project contribute to the overall growth of Sharjah's real estate sector?</h4><p>Since its launch, Al Zahia has proven to be hugely successful with homebuyers and investors. With Phase I of Al Jouri 100% sold and fully occupied, Phase II of Al Jouri 100% sold and due for handover in 4Q2016, and Al Narjis handover planned for 4Q2017, we are on schedule to attain our sales targets and final handover date. As a barometer for the broader growth in Sharjah's property market, it has clearly shown that demand for high-quality residential property remains strong, especially in an exclusive, gated community.</p><h4>Real estate is one of the brightest sectors of Sharjah's economy, suffering little from economic downturns, and has one of the highest investor confidence rates in the region. What makes the sector so attractive?</h4><p>In recent times, Sharjah has benefitted from positioning itself as a regional capital for industrial-related commerce. It has witnessed steady growth in both its urban and economic infrastructure, in spite of economic pressures and volatile cycles experienced since 2008. Sharjah also has the highest number of SMEs—about 47,000—across all the Emirates. Therefore, the economic diversification in Sharjah is not over-reliant on any one industrial sector, but is easily adaptable to deal with changing economic cycles. In Sharjah, we see a clear demand for quality and that is why we are successful. The Emirate has a great deal of potential due to its unique culture, which attracts diverse groups of people. There are museums, parks, and the corniche offering a multitude of things you would not be able to find anywhere else.</p><h4>Have you witnessed interest from foreign investors since the government opened up the property market, and how does opening the market to non-Arabs impact Sharjah's real estate market?</h4><p>The current regulations only allow Emiratis and GCC nationals to purchase in Sharjah; however, we are currently in discussion with the local authorities to soften these regulations and open up the market to foreign buyers. There are already many non-Arabs living in Sharjah, and Al Zahia will be at the forefront because of its proximity to Dubai's airport and the University of Sharjah. In fact, we have a few European families already renting in Al Zahia.</p><h4>When you have such thriving property markets, with big-ticket projects in place and a rising population, how challenging is it to keep inflationary pressure under control?</h4><p>Sharjah is a large Emirate, and these projects are even bigger. If you have more projects it is easier to stabilize prices. With Sharjah experiencing a 3-5% growth rate, outstripping many countries' performance, the Emirate is still attractive, offering stable growth whilst at the same time not experiencing housing valuations or rental costs increasing beyond a manageable level. All in all, Sharjah, and the wider UAE, remains a safe haven for steady investment opportunities and this is projected to be the case for many years ahead.</p><h4>What is your outlook on Sharjah's and the UAE's real estate and construction industry for the medium term?</h4><p>After the 2008 global crisis and the recent recessionary pressures due to falling oil prices, it has been suggested that economic cycles would now be on a shorter time scale. Therefore, developers need to be aware of the new six to seven year cycles and plan accordingly. While the economic situation has seen some recessionary pressures in the last few years, the demand for real estate projects in the form of mixed-use and residential developments remains high. From Sharjah Holding's perspective and the good relationships established between the Sharjah government and Majid Al Futtaim, it is likely that other major development opportunities will be pursued in Sharjah. Our objective is to make Al Zahia the prototype of the mid-size master plan community and this is why we are now working very hard on the landscape and the public area. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you foresee the logistics sector within the context of the current slowdown in Chinese and European markets?</h4><p>We will not see the same rates of growth that we have seen in the last few years; the market has indeed softened. For us that will mean that we will not have double-digit growth, but we will still grow. The UAE is well positioned as a gateway for the Gulf, for East Africa, and for India, Pakistan, and Iran to an extent, and has a number of free zones, too. Therefore, the UAE can maintain strong logistics operations despite global economic factors. We can also add to that the benefits of a clear and transparent financial system, a good legal system, good infrastructure, excellent audits, and quality controls. Most of that is Dubai, but many of the SMEs are based in Sharjah, so Sharjah will continue to benefit.</p><h4>The region is struggling with low oil prices and geopolitical instability, while Brazil is in one of its worst crises in decades. How do these factors affect Gulftainer's operations?</h4><p>Brazil is not doing well right now, with a financial and governmental crisis plaguing the country. Other areas like Saudi Arabia are doing well and we have not seen a significant slowdown there, although there has indeed been a slowdown, with various projects on hold. Iraq is doing well and growing fast. If Yemen finds a political solution, it will also have a huge economic impact on us. Once Iran is reintegrated into the international community, it will also have a major positive effect, being a market of 80 million. Hopefully oil prices will climb a little before stabilizing. I doubt that the price will ever return to USD120 per barrel, but it is at least unlikely to drop back down to USD25, so we are cautiously optimistic. We are optimistic about the global market, and we would like to continue growing and adding new ports. Our core focus is Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Africa, the US, and South America. We do not consider Europe, Northeast Asia, or Australia. We work with ports of around 1 million TEUs in capacity rather than 5 million-TEU ports.</p><h4>How is the company cooperating with the Sharjah Port Authority to increase the capacity of the Sharjah Container Terminal?</h4><p>We have a strong relationship with the port authority and both of us always look at ways to expand. The challenge for Sharjah is that the port is in the middle of the city, so there are constraints to how much it can grow. That was the reason behind Khorfakkan's establishment 20 years ago. Sharjah has been growing at 8-12% per year, and that is all local cargo with no transshipment. Even though Khorfakkan has been growing in terms of productivity, there are still big margins to improve productivity. This year we decided to introduce bigger cranes, and we have been using our existing space more efficiently. We can grow without expanding physically, which is what we have been doing.</p><h4>How has Gulftainer contributed to the sector's growth and to Sharjah's economy overall?</h4><p>We have invested billions in the country in terms of equipment, cranes, logistics, and so on. I came here in 1988 when Sharjah handled 60,000 containers, while today it handles seven times that amount. We have continued to invest to serve the industry here in Sharjah. On top of that, we have established Momentum Logistics, which covers logistics, warehousing, trucking, custom clearance, container repair, and more. That also adds and contributes to growing the economy and expanding the sector in Sharjah and the UAE. We also have a company called Avalon Logistics, which does long-haul trucking, and that enables businesses and people to export more to the GCC by truck. We help all these companies to get their products out to other countries. Beyond that, we provide employment for 3,500 people. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Air Arabia is today the most successful low-cost carrier in the Middle East. What aspects of your company contributed to this success?</h4><p>This is a reflection primarily of the effectiveness of our business model, which consists of a mass-market customer base and reduced operating cost structure. Customer comfort and convenience are top of our agenda and even as we focus on delivering greater value to our passengers we remain scrupulous in ensuring that this is done without compromising in-flight comfort. Additionally, Air Arabia's innovative multi-hub model is placed in strategic locations across the region, Sharjah, Ras Al Khaimah, Casablanca, Alexandria, and Amman, allowing us to maximize the range of our fleet and further extend our reach. Due to the fast pace and competitive nature of the sector, constant innovation is the key to survival and success. The ability to anticipate and adapt quickly to changing demands and market trends is very important. At Air Arabia, we ensure that innovation is integrated into our core processes and strategic agenda. Every innovation we make informs and complements value-for-money air travel, which is at the heart of our business.</p><h4>The aviation sector in the Middle East is now the fastest growing in the world. In terms of your medium-term outlook on the sector, do you see it heading toward further steady growth over the next decade?</h4><p>We remain highly confident of the medium to long-term prospects for the regional aviation industry, especially the low-cost carrier model. The GCC, in our view, represents a particular sphere of opportunity for low-cost carriers, especially when we consider that approximately 2 billion people live within a four-hour flight time of the region. Carriers across the board are investing in expanding their fleets and route networks. Air Arabia alone operates a fleet of 44 new Airbus A320 aircraft, with more scheduled for delivery, serving more than 120 destinations across the Middle East, North Africa, Europe, the Indian Subcontinent, and Asia—a figure that is set to rise exponentially in the coming years. Air Arabia's journey toward becoming a leading budget airline internationally is an ongoing one, and our steady growth and expanding international presence over the past decade is a firm indication that we are making rapid progress toward achieving this goal. If we can keep maintaining our level of operational efficiency and our pace of business growth and market expansion, I would like to believe that the day when Air Arabia is present in almost all international markets is not far away.</p><h4>What are the key differences between operating private and state-owned airline companies, and what are the challenges that you face in competing with them?</h4><p>Generally speaking, state-owned airlines have an inherent advantage in terms of access to capital and they also enjoy the comfort of a safety net to fall back on. That said, these are no guarantees of success in an industry where efficiency and strategy are fundamental to sustained performance. Effectively, both business setups need to focus on the customer and the quality of service. It is also about the efficiency with which you are able to implement a business strategy while keeping up with an evolving marketplace. Having achieved profitability in the very first year of its operations, Air Arabia has maintained a consistent track record of profitability and growth over the last decade. Competition naturally helps spur innovation and tests the resilience of airline industry players and their ability to survive and thrive in a crowded field. Air Arabia has consistently proven its resourcefulness in successfully navigating the struggles of a competitive marketplace. We pioneered the low-cost aviation concept in the Middle East; it was the success of our low-cost model that encouraged others to enter the market and forced other airlines to revise their pricing. Air Arabia is also the first and only Arab airline to list publicly. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>More than 10 million passengers visited Sharjah International Airport in 2015. What strategy are you following to achieve these results?</h4><p>Sharjah International Airport is coping with the ever-growing demands of airport users by enhancing the airport's existing capacity in various areas, including check-in counters, new gates, additional human resources, and the implementation of the latest technologies and equipment to facilitate these requirements. The airport witnessed a 12% increase in passenger traffic in the first quarter of 2016, against the same period in the previous year, and we are expecting a high percentage of passenger growth by the end of this year.</p><h4>What have been the main drivers of Sharjah's aviation growth over recent years?</h4><p>Sharjah International Airport  has become the popular and preferred travelling option of many because of its efficient procedures, excellent services and facilities, and its strategic location. The presence of Air Arabia, the UAE's national carrier, is a key driver of the growth. Thanks to its reliable, safe and efficient services, excellent packages, and attractive prices, serving many destinations with a modern fleet of aircraft, many passengers choose to travel several times a year through Sharjah       <br>International Airport. Strategically, there has also been increased competition, with many airlines increasing capacity of existing routes and adding new routes. </p><h4>Sharjah International Airport is focused on short-haul passengers, targeting a check-in and boarding time of just 20 minutes. How does the airport balance this efficiency against the rapid growth in passenger numbers?</h4><p>Sharjah International Airport  is keen to facilitate procedures and provide the best services and amenities to our valuable passengers; therefore, we have invested in new food and beverage outlets and enhanced our car-parking facilities. Working in partnership with Sharjah RTA, there are now increased bus routes to our airport and we are continually investing in new technologies and behind-the-scenes improvements to enhance the passenger experience. The distance between the check-in counters and boarding gates is very close, taking just a few minutes to reach the gates.</p><h4>What are the current investment opportunities for Sharjah Airports Authority?</h4><p>The future for the UAE aviation industry is bright. Revenue passenger-kilometers (RPKs) are expected to increase in the years to come, given the steady development of short-haul, long-haul, and low-cost carriers. Today, the UAE is considered one of the world's favorite holiday destinations and a great place to do business. This would have been difficult to achieve without the success and growth of the UAE's airlines and infrastructure. Similarly, in trade and cargo, these carriers facilitate trans-shipments as well as origin and destination cargo, exploiting the excellent strategic location of the UAE and leveraging its world-class infrastructure of ports and road network to the fullest. Sharjah International Airport  is expanding and growing; therefore, there are many attractive areas for foreign investment in general aviation, aircraft maintenance services, aircraft hangars, and other aviation activities.</p><h4>What is your outlook on the region's aviation sector in the short to medium term, and how is Sharjah's airport preparing for Expo 2020?</h4><p>The Middle East aviation market is set to grow by 6.6% through to 2016, which will make it the second-fastest growing market in the world. The aviation industry alone contributes about 15% to the UAE's GDP. In Sharjah, transport and logistics are a very dynamic market and the total market size reached AED3.53 billion in 2012, out of which AED1.28 billion worth was sea freight and AED0.7 billion air freight, offering rewarding investment opportunities for local and foreign investors. Regarding Expo 2020, we consider this event as important for the UAE as a whole and not for Dubai alone. We are planning for and expect an influx of people visiting the UAE by 2020. With SHJ's flexibility and with proximity to the Expo 2020 venue, we see ourselves as being very involved and busy during the Expo. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you review your operations over the past year and what achievements stand out?</h4><p>Last year was a great year for Bee'ah and we are confident that 2016 will be even better. In 2015, we continued to lead the region in the environmental waste management sector and expanded outside of Sharjah for the first time. These included many major contracts in Dubai, such as the Burj Khalifa, Dubai World Trade Centre, and TECOM in Dubai Media City. We also started managing Dubai Marina Mall and remain contenders for numerous large international contracts that are still in the pipeline. As a result of Bee'ah's efforts, since forming in 2007 Sharjah has the highest rate of diversion of waste from landfills in the Middle East, and we are now expanding our scope beyond waste management toward becoming an environmental contracting company, which has opened up new areas for R&amp;D such as monitoring and measuring air quality. Bee'ah already has air quality stations in place, and within a few months we will have seven stations.</p><h4>What is the current appetite for the development of waste energy projects in the UAE?</h4><p>Across the UAE, the strategic direction of both the federal and individual Emirates' governments is to have less dependence on oil and to diversify the national and domestic economies. The UAE federal government is working toward these solutions, with Sharjah playing a pivotal part in driving ahead and supporting such initiatives. At Bee'ah, we are always exploring new and dynamic forms of renewable energy and, from our side, we have already set in motion plans for recyclable waste plants and solar energy farms, as the initial focus. In addition, we have a waste-to-energy project that we will start building in Sharjah this year, in collaboration with Abu Dhabi's clean energy giant, Masdar, and the UK's Chinook Sciences. We signed the partnership agreement with Masdar, in January, and this will result in both companies working together to develop more waste-to-energy projects across the UAE. We are pleased to have made such a strong partnership with such a likeminded organization as Masdar, and we look forward to working with it on many joint projects of mutual interest.</p><h4>How are Bee'ah and the Environmental Authority promoting recycling habits among Sharjah's citizens?</h4><p>As a public private partnership company, we do all of the awareness programs for the general public and schools ourselves. Our school programs operate in both public and private institutions and they are part of an ongoing initiative. With the Ministry of Environment we are also looking to become more involved in taking the message beyond Sharjah and out across the UAE. We were honored to receive the newly appointed minister for a visit recently. Bee'ah has also committed to many research programs, as we believe that as a private company dedicated to conservation, we need to give back to the community and encourage further research and training.</p><h4>How would you assess the current level of awareness, among the Sharjah population, in terms of using clean and renewable energy?</h4><p>Regionally, people recognize that Sharjah has already done a lot in promoting and developing technologies and practices in the area of renewable energy. Without being boastful, we are now considered one of the cleanest cities in the Middle East; however, we still have a long way to go before achieving the ambitious goals we have set out. For example, while we are still recovering waste from building facilities or demolitions, to take it one step further we need to effectively recycle that material. Right now the only product that we are recycling fully is tires, as well as materials made of plastic and aluminum. In 2016, we will start recycling the plastics ourselves, which we envisage will trigger the development of a plastics hub, in Sharjah. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the performance of the Emirates Industrial City (EIC) over the past year?</h4><p>We have around 800 companies, all ranging in size. At the beginning of 2015 there was an improvement in our real estate department. Sales increased and the range of warehousing capacity was strong. Unfortunately, that was only the case for a short period, after which the market started losing momentum. The problem here in the Emirates is that we always take the market to the extreme—nothing is gradual. This is why most of 2015 was tough for us and we are still struggling, particularly with the current oil prices. In terms of financing, since 2008 the banks have been very conservative, which is due to the lead of the central bank. The banks' exposure to real estate is high and unfortunately our project is perceived as a real estate project because it is industrial real estate. We do not have financing and the EIC is self-financed. The EIC has advantages when compared to industrial zones in other Emirates, especially infrastructure, as the site is already available for use. The entire infrastructure is completely developed, including the electricity supply. The site is accessible and not hidden away, and we are near to the coast. Whatever we sell we reinvest alongside shareholders' money. Current conditions are likely to continue through 2016 and into the beginning of 2017, even though oil prices are improving.</p><h4>What can the government can do to boost the private sector?</h4><p>The government is supportive, especially in Sharjah. The government should always be reviewing the rules and regulations to attract investors, particularly industry. The problem is that sometimes people mix up the commercial and the industrial sites. The EIC is not real estate, but sometimes the rules that apply to real estate are applied to us. This should not be the case because, for example, there is a high turnover on apartments. By comparison, changing or selecting a new site for your factory is a major undertaking. You have more flexibility and choice when it comes to homes and offices, compared to industrial investments. Increasing fees are becoming a major issue as well. Sometimes the cost of electricity can also discourage investors and businesses from coming to Sharjah.</p><h4>What are your expectations for occupancy?</h4><p>Some of our properties are for lease so clients come and go; therefore, it will be a continuous process. Right now we have eight sectors and we have taken care of five of them. Some are 8.5 million sqft and we have 20 million sqft remaining. We expect this remaining space to be occupied within the next five years. However, for our warehousing and logistics zone we know you cannot always find the right customers at the right price. Therefore, instead of just holding onto that land and waiting, we believe you have to add value to it by building something on it and then sub-leasing to generate revenue. The return on this can be very good, at around 10-20%.</p><h4>Do you think that companies coming to the region for the World Expo 2020 will have an impact on your business?</h4><p>Unfortunately, I do not think we should expect too much from the Expo. Dubai will benefit through the development of new sites. Dubai's government and business sector are always ahead of the times with their planning and organization. They have a stronger PPP relationship and the public and private sector work well together because most of the companies in Dubai are semi-government. One impact might be the rising cost of doing business and land in Dubai, which is increasing. Dubai is a commercial and service-based center rather than an industrial center. Activities that need a large area of land will find themselves coming here, not because of the Expo, but because of the lower cost of doing business and the chance for expansion here. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the oil and gas industry evolved in Sharjah over the last decade?</h4><p>There were many exploration activities before Sajaa Gas Field was discovered from as early as the 1950s, but with little success. The first commercial discovery in Sharjah was the Mubarek offshore field by Crescent Petroleum in the early 1970s, which continued to produce until 2009 when the concession expired. The Sajaa discovery was made in the late 1970s and continues to produce till today. Two other smaller fields, Moveyeid and Kahaif, were also discovered in the 1980s. Dana Gas developed a new gas field that was discovered offshore between Ajman and Sharjah, which has been in production since early 2016. SNOC is starting a new exploration program onshore Sharjah, with seismic survey starting in September 2016.</p><h4>What is the role of enhanced gas recovery (EGR) in the UAE, and how sustainable is it?</h4><p>EGR is part of the natural phase of the development of any gas field. It has mainly two approaches, both of which are implemented in the life of a gas field. The first method is to reduce the backpressure on the gas wells by installing gas compressors. The other is to access all areas of the reservoir by drilling more wells and drilling laterals (horizontal drilling) in existing wells. We have done both in Sharjah, as we have installed several stages of compression in the gas processing plant and in the field. We have also drilled 41 wells in Sajaa with almost 200 laterals. SNOC is also evaluating methods to improve the recovery of condensate (a very light form of crude, which is normally gas in the reservoir).</p><h4>Given the higher costs involved, should the government or the private sector invest in EGR?</h4><p>It is always a mix. In most countries you have a national oil company that works with the private sector, and the private sector can be major integrated oil and gas corporations like Exxon, BP, Shell, or smaller companies like Crescent Petroleum. In Europe or the US it is almost 100% private sector investment; the government acts as the regulator, but this is not true for most of the world. SNOC is the national oil company of Sharjah and we are essentially taking the business previously managed by multinational corporations. We will always need the private sector to develop oil resources, and countries that have gone completely national are technically weaker than countries with a mix. The UAE has a very good mix of national oil corporations and private companies.  Sharjah's onshore operations are now 100% government (SNOC) but we maintain the same high standards of multi-national corporations and enter new joint ventures with private entities.</p><h4>Why are international partnerships, like that between BP and SNOC, so important in the energy industry?</h4><p>It is like any specialty we go into, like medicine for example, unless we continuously stay exposed to the latest technology, our standards will drop and production and revenue will eventually decline. We have to stay on top of industry standards and technical advancements, and the ones who typically maintain them are multinational corporations, because they have huge R&amp;D departments and are exposed to the top regulators. They follow these standards even where the local regulator does not require them, because of their reputation. The UAE is doing a great job in this aspect, where even national oil companies such as SNOC, ADNOC, or DPE, which are 100% government, are not 100% local in terms of employees, and try to get top-quality employees regardless of nationality. While we maintain our focus on developing local talent, we do not compromise on standards and we expect from our national employees the same or even higher standards that we expect from all employees. We are proud of the high level of performance and achievements and the talent of our national employees. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you talk about how you are incorporating sustainability into commercial and residential areas?</h4><p>Sustainability does not mean that you are compromising on net profit in favor of ethics and principles. There is a misconception that when people talk about sustainability they always look at the cost side of it, ignoring safety, health, and the environment. That is why we have created the SEWA Sustainability Statement, which says that we work with individuals within the organization to bring the true principles of sustainability for greener solutions with no harm to the people or environment. This is accompanied by a lot of awareness programs that follow the theme “catch it from the beginning." We meet with developers and designers at the start, and explain the target of 30% reduction in water use, then make a deep investigation and do an energy audit on a building, shopping mall, or school before it begins. Saving energy means saving the environment, reducing CO2 emissions, and reducing the bottom line for the developers.</p><h4>Can you outline the initiatives and road map leading to 2020 for reaching the 30% water reduction target?</h4><p>Globally the energy sector is experiencing a tough time, which is part of the reason why the UN felt it was the right time to introduce 17 goals for sustainable development in September 2015. The UN was trying to tell everyone in the world that we should work together for the coming 15 years to tackle certain issues and reach certain goals. In the US, authorities in California and Georgia reduced access to water for three to four hours a day to reduce consumption during periods of drought. Similarly, in India, water has been transported with vans, caravans, and trucks from one state to another because of water scarcity. Access to potable water is a real issue and for that reason we did a global study to understand the best practices when it comes to conservation. We found that in Japan they were able to reach 50% water re-use and some places in Europe reached 20-30%. Therefore, we are focusing on reaching a 30% water re-use target until 2020 through certain KPIs and KSIs.</p><h4>Is this an issue that needs to be approached on a personal or an industrial scale?</h4><p>Water is a concern for everybody, and we try and instil that from a young age. We visit children at school and teach then how to install a small device that reduces water usage by 50%, so they can go back home and use it within the home. To me engagement is the key because policing alone does not work; you need engagement, especially with children. The main challenge is to strike the balance between commercial and social. This is the key between our social commitment obligation, which is that you need to have electricity, water, and gas 24/7, with no compromises. This is why our Vision 2020 has goals and each goal has system priorities for the vision. The key to the whole SEWA vision is engagement and there is a big difference between knowing something and implementing it. We have very diversified cultures here also with more than 200 different nationalities, so reaching a common language is not an easy thing to do.</p><h4>Can you provide some information on the Hamriyah plant expansion plans?</h4><p>It is in the final stage now, and we are in the process of selecting the contractor. The changes we want to implement are key to the continuous optimization process. The Hamriyah plant is built on a simple cycle and when you go for a combined cycle with the same amount of energy you can get more output, extra energy. The way that the heat gets used in the system gives you extra energy, so we are moving from a simple cycle to a combined cycle, which will give an output of nearly 200 MW. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the role of the Sharjah Finance Department in setting financial policy at this moment in time?</h4><p>The main responsibility of Sharjah Finance is to implement and manage the physical policy of the Emirate of Sharjah. At the Sharjah Finance Department we are always looking for best practices in budgeting and we already implemented activity-based budgeting, which is one of the best practices in the world for managing expenditure and how we link the activities of the department with the budget allocation. We assess output by four factors; quantity, quality, cost, and time. Any government entity should be accountable for every single dirham and how it is spent, and what output or return that will generate. Before, the system was less regulated, and entities just had to show their balance sheets. It is now performance-based budgeting, which contains activities, output, and the result for each department.</p><h4>How are government investments being prioritized, in terms of fixed-capital, internal investment, or digital transition?</h4><p>Regarding the sukuk, we have already issued the first issue of around USD750 million for 10 years and the government of Sharjah was the first to issue in September 2014. A total of 250 investors participated and around 10 times over the subscription rate was reached. The second was issued in March 2015 of around USD500 million. The Finance Department is linked to around 70 government entities and we are the first government in the region that has started this electronic integration, which we began in 2006. We started with the integration of 20 departments and are now around 70. All the procedures are now electronic; accounting, purchasing, and budgeting is all integrated and we are now paperless. We are also making some procedures and application processes digital, in a bid to generate more efficiency. Everything is now fully automated and we are developing smart applications for some reports. This is useful because, for example, the chairman can, through his iPad or iPhone, approve a payment process, the budget transfer from code to code, and he can approve purchase orders, so it is easy for him to do this anywhere in the world.</p><h4>Can you tell us about the Sharjah Asset Management activities?</h4><p>Sharjah Asset Management is the investment arm of the government of Sharjah and we are trying to invest in sectors that will add value to the Sharjah economy. We have the Sharjah Oasis industrial area and Sharjah is one of the biggest industrial areas with 19 industrial areas now in place, making Sharjah well known as an industrial hub. This is the government's strategy and in line with that we are also managing the Souk Al Jubail, which is one of the biggest souks in the region. We have also Souk Al Haraj for cars, which is also one of the biggest markets in the region. We are trying to focus on the areas of the economy that will add value to the Sharjah economy. We have some other investments in the banks, aviation, and so forth.</p><h4>Do you feel that the portfolio is currently balanced?</h4><p>We established in 2014 so it is still an investment arm of the government and we are trying to build it the right way, step by step, without hurry. It is difficult in times of global economic difficulty, but nevertheless we are trying our best to choose whatever is best for the Sharjah government. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you rate SIB's overall results in 2015?</h4><p>The overall results of SIB in 2015 are strong and a continuation of our progressive growth year after year with good profitability and strong structural indicators despite the global economic slowdown and depressed oil prices. Compared to our competitors, we are the fastest-growing bank in Sharjah in terms of our balance sheet, retail products, and branches. We are ranked 10th in the UAE in terms of the size of our branch network. Looking at the financial ratios for the bank, they are very strong compared to most banks in the UAE; for example, we have one of the highest capital adequacy ratios in the market. Regarding the quality of our portfolio, our non-performing assets and receivables coverage ratio is above 80%, which is a comfortable level, strengthening the bank's financial position and investors', stockholders', and rating agencies' confidence.</p><h4>Do you identify a trend in some conventional banks offering Islamic products attracting new clients? Are some Islamic banks also offering services for non-Muslims?</h4><p>There is a high demand for Islamic products, and Islamic banks are growing rapidly all around the world. There is a misconception that Islamic banking is only for Muslims, but that is not the case. It is a service like any other financial offering and is designed for all customers. Sukuks are being increasingly offered by conventional banks. In fact, many banks and governments are issuing more sukuks than conventional bonds. They are easier to sell, demand is high, and they are attractive to investors. Conventional bonds only target conventional investors, losing on those investors who want sharia-compliant products. Sukuk satisfies everybody. Some funds are also structured solely for sharia-compliant bonds and products. It is an asset-based bond; you cannot buy or sell something that you do not own. It does away with speculation, and so adds stability to the market and global economy. The cost of bonds for banks is higher than sukuks, even though it is the same risk and the same issuer, and that is because of demand. Demand is growing daily, and there is still plenty of room to grow in both conventional and Islamic banking.</p><h4>Despite the current international economic situation, Sharjah is developing steadily. What role is the bank playing in the overall development of the economy?</h4><p>We contribute effectively to all major projects in Sharjah, and especially infrastructure projects. We were also one of the managers and book runners of the government of Sharjah's first sukuk issuance in 2015. We are one of the highest contributors in the areas of social responsibility, the knowledge economy, and the development of UAE nationals. Social responsibility is one of our core values, and SIB contributes by taking part in different community activities and by supporting most organizations and causes in Sharjah, such as orphanages, special needs centers, cancer patients, health, education, and so on. SIB also contributes greatly to research activities in universities. We have special customized cards for students who can easily use them for access and funding. By law, as an Islamic institution, we have to reserve 2.57% of profits annually as a zakat fund to be spent on the community and this ethical component is fundamental to Islamic finance.</p><h4>In your opinion, what is the current state of the Islamic finance industry?</h4><p>In the UAE, the Islamic banking sector accounts for more than 17% of total banking assets and more than 19% of customer deposits, and the industry continues to grow despite the slowdown in the global economy and the sharp drop in oil prices. The UAE differs from other countries that depend on oil as the main component of GDP in terms of diversification of the economy. We are far less dependent on oil and gas than some other economies. That being said, oil is still the biggest sector and we are not spared from the global impact of oil prices, but through diversification we have added robustness to the UAE economy in general.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Which of the sectors that Crescent Enterprise is involved in show good potential?</h4><p>Crescent Enterprises has seen significant growth across many of our core businesses. Gulftainer, our Sharjah-headquartered ports and logistics subsidiary, is a good example of this, achieving a compound annual growth rate of 18% from 2012 to 2015, compared to the global throughput growth level of 3% during the same period. As the only Middle Eastern port operator with a strategic presence in the Americas, Gulftainer is set to expand into new markets with plans to triple its volume over the next 10 years across five continents.</p><h4>How do you see Crescent Enterprises and its subsidiary companies adapting to the evolution of the region's less oil-dependent future?</h4><p>Our focus on long-term, strategic development and value creation, aligned with an entrepreneurial spirit, enables us to stay ahead of the curve and retain our competitive edge. Diversification, which is now more than ever a priority for the region, is in fact at the core of what we do at Crescent Enterprises. We already have interests in a diverse range of sectors, from ports and logistics to private equity investments, as well as business aviation, power, engineering, and healthcare. As the region's economies diversify even further, we see more opportunities in the trade, power, healthcare, and general infrastructure sectors that will enable us to broaden our activities and continue to grow sustainable, scalable, and profitable businesses across a range of synergistic sectors.</p><h4>Where will the conglomerate expand next?</h4><p>We see many opportunities for value creation, not only in our core business sectors, but also in industries that are well positioned for disruptive growth, such as FMCG, F&amp;B, renewables, and technology. We are also bullish about markets in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, and have already made a strategic investment to enter Africa's burgeoning e-commerce market. In addition, we are building new businesses through CE-Ventures, our business incubation division.</p><h4>Crescent Enterprises champions the need for strong corporate governance in the region. What are your highlights in this regard?</h4><p>We champion an inclusive mindset where businesses can “do well by doing good" and we have taken a leadership role to address, not only the critical challenges our communities face, but also in support of broader sustainable development. To maximize our impact we have formed strategic partnerships with organizations that share our values and principles. An example of this is working with the Pearl Initiative, established in partnership with the United Nations Global Compact, which promotes a corporate culture of accountability and transparency as a key driver of competitiveness across the GCC. In addition, we have partnered with many global institutions as part of our efforts to bring about effective change in the way we do business in across the Middle East. These include the World Economic Forum's 'Partnering Against Corruption' Initiative, the UN Global Compact, Ashoka, and the UN's Women Empowerment Initiative.</p><h4>How would you assess doing business in the region and what are your expectations for Sharjah's economic growth over the next few years?</h4><p>The UAE tops the MENA region in the World Bank's ranking of ease of doing business. Its diversified economy, openness to private sector engagement and collaboration, enabling infrastructure, and strong regulatory environment are reasons for its success as a business destination. In common with the other Emirates, Sharjah has benefited from the UAE leadership's focus on entrepreneurship, innovation, and good governance as key drivers of economic growth. Specific initiatives led by the Sharjah Investment Authority (Shurooq), and the new entrepreneurship center at the American University of Sharjah (Sheraa), complement the efforts of the private sector to raise Sharjah's standing as a business hub. What is also highly commendable is Sharjah's commitment to supporting local culture, talent, and the environment. Crescent Enterprises is proud to be part of the Sharjah success story, and I am confident the Emirate's economy will continue to develop strongly in the coming years. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Sharjah Media Centre is adapting to the Emirate's rapid evolution. What are the main new developments at the Centre?</h4><p>The government established Sharjah Media Centre five years ago. Today, it has emerged as a single-window, unique platform that anyone can approach to know any and everything about Sharjah, its government, institutions, the economy, government procedures, media, education, history, and landmarks—or any other area. We have a team of more than 100 qualified, well-trained professionals. We are also constantly looking to empower our staff by providing them with training and new skills so that they give their best in serving the Centre. We are in touch with other contact centers in the UAE and the region to help us with this. The Centre is also responsible for the PR and media coverage of His Highness the Ruler of Sharjah, both in the UAE and abroad. We have a dedicated social media account for the Ruler covering all of his events and engagements.</p><h4>The Sharjah Media Centre is the media arm of the government of Sharjah and aims to promote the Emirate. How is the Centre working to achieve that?</h4><p>We have built a rewarding relationship with other government departments and agencies in the Emirate and are constantly working with them toward the objective of acting as the media arm and platform of the government. For example, we liaise with the Sharjah Commerce and Tourism Development Authority to publish various statistics about the industry, such as the Emirate's tourist numbers and museum visitor data. If the number of tourists visiting a particular area or attraction is seen as dwindling, then the Centre could focus on promoting it. Of course, we are constantly working to strengthen our partnership with other stakeholders and present a positive image of the Emirate through our media interaction. Since the inception of the Centre, especially with the launch of the International Government Communication Forum (IGCF), which is attended by more than 2,000 world leaders and media personalities, there has been a clear, positive, and perceptible improvement in the way Sharjah is seen around the world and across the region.</p><h4>This year Sharjah hosted the fifth International Government Communication Forum (IGCF) with the slogan “Citizens for Prosperity." What were the main highlights of this year and how would you rate its results?</h4><p>The IGCF is all about enhancing government communication and this year we focused on improving communication between citizens and the government. As HH Sheikh Dr. Sultan bin Mohamed Al Qasimi, Member of Supreme Council and Ruler of Sharjah, said in his opening address at the 2015 edition of the Forum, communication needs to be two-way, not just one way—from the government to the people. As part of this theme, we discussed various aspects of communication involving the government and its people, including areas as different as aviation and culture, with experienced speakers from both the public and private sectors running the sessions.</p><h4>What are your priorities and goals for 2016?</h4><p>Every year we set ourselves certain objectives and activities that are aimed at supporting and working with other government departments. We need to take the next step now and have one centralized media entity in Sharjah. We are planning to meet with every media team of every government department at least every three months to see what their problems and concerns are and how to address them. We are working to produce one coordinated media calendar for Sharjah. We need to streamline the system. We also need to improve our call center so that it is open and accessible 24 hours. We need to make the Press Club more attractive and accessible to journalists as well by providing more services and benefits. We also need to expand the scope of the Ruler's PR and media coverage beyond Arabic and English to other languages, especially when he travels abroad. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Sharjah Media Corporation's main goal is to improve the competitiveness of the media industry in Sharjah. What is the philosophy behind your operation?</h4><p>Sharjah Media Corporation focuses on educational television and radio programs that cater to families; therefore, our programming is safe for anyone to watch or listen to at any time of the day or night. In the spirit of inclusivity, Sharjah Television is also looking to expand and increase its number of channels. We already have a channel for the Eastern Area (Sharqiya from Kalba) and we are currently testing a new channel for the Central Region (Al Wousta from Al Dhaid) that should be broadcasting soon. Ultimately, we are committed to covering all the geographical regions of Sharjah.</p><h4>Do you plan to expand your broadcasting units to cover the other Emirates?</h4><p>As a local television service that belongs to the Sharjah government, we generally broadcast from Sharjah for an audience that is primarily Sharjah based. That being said, our coverage is worldwide and so our channels are viewed everywhere—we have Outside Broadcasting (OB) Vans and SNG Vans that go to Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and the Northern Emirates to take feeds and cover events and news. In addition to having reporters covering all of the UAE, we also have a good relationship with the Associated Press, which helps us with journalists all around the world. Nonetheless, we are still a local, government-run entity and, therefore, our base and core focus remain on the Emirate of Sharjah. To provide ease of connectivity and protection in case of an emergency, we have a networked link of fiber lines connecting SMC with Dubai TV, ADTV, WAM, Kalba, and the TAS</p><h4>How advanced is the media industry in Sharjah and how quickly is it growing compared to other Emirates?</h4><p>Sharjah was the first Emirate in the UAE to broadcast over the radio and some Sharjah radio programs today receive top ratings by listeners around the UAE and internationally. Sharjah Television has been around for a long time and the view we take on what we broadcast is different from many others. As a result, it is difficult to directly compare our content to other stations. Primarily, Sharjah Media targets audiences with a focus on culture, tradition, and family values. Our programs are followed not only on television, but also on various digital media platforms and the country from abroad that watches us the most is the US.</p><h4>Do you see the media sector rapidly growing and improving here?</h4><p>We see this at both Sharjah Media Corporation and at the Sharjah Media Centre. The industry is growing fast and technology is developing quickly, so in order to stay at the forefront of progress, we attend various industry exhibitions around the world. For example, the NAB Show in Las Vegas is an event we attend every year to check out new technologies coming into the market. In Sharjah, there has been a big change in the way the media industry is perceived. These days, anyone with a phone can be a journalist, photographer, or eyewitness; therefore, at Sharjah Media Centre, we are now also active on social media. The media sector has always been in a state of rapid change and we have to keep pace with that.</p><h4>What are Sharjah Media Corporation's ambitions for the next five years?</h4><p>At Sharjah Media Corporation, we aim to add more TV channels to our broadcast portfolio. Coupled with these expansions is our commitment to continually improving our existing offerings, which is part of the ongoing strategy to further increase our viewership and listener numbers. There are a number of challenges faced by broadcasters in Sharjah and the UAE, which is mainly due to the high number of residents who do not speak Arabic. To this end, we are looking at ways in which we can more effectively target these demographic groupings in addition to our already strong Arabic content. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Sharjah's economy performed so far in 2016?</h4><p>Sharjah's economy has performed excellently throughout the year and we believe we are on the cusp of a new boom. This is attributed to the Emirate's commitment to diversifying its economy and its allocation of funds across an array of sectors that support global demand from investors and facilitate the economic paradigm shift from oil and gas related investments. The Sharjah Economic Development Department issued 35% more new trade licenses during the first two months of the year compared with the same period last year. The success of Sharjah's diversification policy and business model has been highlighted by Standard &amp; Poor's 2015 A/A-1 long and short-term foreign and local currency sovereign credit ratings for the Emirate and its projection for a stable economic outlook. The agency's analysis positioned the Emirate as a diverse production-based economy.</p><h4>In what way does Shurooq act as a bridge between the private sector and the government, and how does it make sure to maintain a strong relationship between the two?</h4><p>A central strand of Shurooq's corporate philosophy is that the private sector cannot be strong unless the government is strong, and vice versa. The relationship is, in a sense, codependent, and the more this relationship is built on solid foundations defined by clear goals and objectives, the more Sharjah and the UAE will be able to attract investment and achieve sustainable growth. The most recent event that we hosted to bring the two sectors together took place this July, with senior representatives from across government departments in attendance, along with business leaders from the private sector. Subjects addressed at the event included scientific ways to facilitate tangible processes to nurture public-private partnerships and how integration between the two sectors helps to reduce unemployment and increase growth rates. One of the proposed models for partnership at the event focused on voluntary initiatives, which depend on simple and non-complicated norms and relationships. A second involved mandatory legislation to ensure the establishment and implementation of projects that contribute to the development of the economy.</p><h4>One of the government's priorities, both at the local and federal level, is Emiratization. In this context, how is Shurooq working to promote this and attract talented UAE nationals to Sharjah's workforce?</h4><p>Shurooq is committed to Emiratization; we run regular programs at UAE universities as well as participate at career fairs to attract local talent to take up positions with the organization. Shurooq works hand-in-hand with the Sharjah government in its drive to increase Emiratization. Of the government's total budget for 2016, 6% has been allocated for assistance and support, which will see government jobs created for citizens. Shurooq is an essential part of the UAE community and as such, works to offer meaningful openings and career growth opportunities to the country's new graduates and young people.</p><h4>Do you think that factors such as tightening liquidity or the threat of inflation in the real estate sector can be challenges for the economy, and what is your medium-term outlook?</h4><p>Sharjah's economy is currently well positioned thanks to the government putting in place a wide range of initiatives to help diversify Sharjah's economic base, encourage investment, and develop global trade. UAE banks are tightening their liquidity due to weak bank deposits in light of lower oil receipts, and we are witnessing an increase in interest rates and a reduction of credit. It is also true that rents in the real estate sector are increasing. However, there has been no concomitant decline in government spending in Sharjah. But as it stands, almost half of the Emirate's 2016 budget has been allocated to economic development, so we believe that the Emirate is capable of heading off a decrease in economic growth through high levels of investment. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The last couple of years have been eventful, with socio-economic instabilities in the Middle East and across the world and commodity prices having an impact on many industries. In light of all this, how has Sharjah's economy performed so far in 2016?</h4><p>Over the year the global economy has witnessed a decline in growth rates to less than 1.5% with the economic recession in the EU, a key partner of the UAE, and with the significant decline in the growth rates in China as well as the growth in the US economy, not to mention the drop in oil prices and its subsequent impact on the Arab region. Meanwhile, Sharjah's economy maintained rates of standard evolution and cumulative growth of more than 10% over the past 10 years. Sharjah recorded, over the last two years, a growing number of new companies establishing themselves, with growth rates at 4.9% in 2014 and 4.6% in 2015. In addition, the renewal of licenses increased to 4.3% and 6.4% in 2014 and 2015, respectively. Such indicators helped significantly in the stability of Sharjah's GDP during the last two years. However, as for the growth and its impact on commodity prices and the volume of industrial production, the reports that are issued from SEDD showed that the licenses related to the industrial sector hit a growth rate of 6% and 8.3% in 2015 and 2014. Moreover, Sharjah's inflation rate does not exceed 4%, which is considered acceptable and healthy.</p><h4>How important is it for the Sharjah authorities to implement partnerships and collaborations with the private sector?</h4><p>Government agencies of any sort cannot run the market or implement policies without partnerships with the private sector. SEDD believes in the value of creating partnership with the private sector by applying the public-private partnership (PPP) model. The department has worked on applying such a model through holding and attending intensive consultative meetings with a number of economic sectors as well as making a particular effort to engage with young entrepreneurs. These meetings paid great attention to what more the government of Sharjah can do to meet the private sector's needs.</p><h4>Sharjah has managed to create a sophisticated, diversified, and increasingly knowledge-based economy in a region known for greatly relying on oil. What has been the key driver behind this achievement?</h4><p>Sharjah has been considered the country's cradle of traditional educational institutions and the city of culture for centuries. It has a unique and well-known university city that teaches more than 45,000 students and many educational centers. It has achieved this through wise leadership, and the government continues to pay great attention to education and believes that it is key to the development of any civilization or nation.</p><h4>What is your outlook on the long-term of Sharjah's socio-economic development, and which sector will be SEDD's main focus over the next few years?</h4><p>There is no doubt that the small and micro enterprises sector will be among the priorities of the department. Also, we expect a remarkable development in the industrial sector judging by the increase in the number of industrial establishments and its work to provide the necessary infrastructure with the concerned departments and authorities in Sharjah. It is worth mentioning that SEDD has a wise vision to improve the Emirate's economic knowledge and to cooperate with the private sector as well as the universities in the field of development in order to benefit from their innovation, creativity, and research, which will help to improve the Emirate's business environment. The department is also a member of the Industrial Coordination Council, which aims to apply the green industry policy to provide more working opportunities and to increase the growth of industries and its contribution to GDP, which is expected to reach 20% by 2021, as well as to focus on the green economy and the next generation of industries. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The department is a new government entity, established in 2014. What was the main reason behind its establishment?</h4><p>The Department was established under the guidance of HH Sheikh Dr. Sultan bin Mohammed Al Qasimi, Member of the Supreme Council of the UAE and Ruler of Sharjah, to develop Sharjah's relations with local and international organizations. Sharjah already boasts international relations based on trade, culture, and tourism with a wide array of entities and NGOs. The Department is the primary contact point for any international organization to coordinate and facilitate opportunities in the Emirate of Sharjah. We ensure that all stakeholders in Sharjah are provided the relevant information to engage in our activities and initiatives across the globe.</p><h4>How has Sharjah's involvement with NGOs and international governments evolved in recent years?</h4><p>Sharjah's economic development, business opportunities, and tourism offering is coupled with a focus on environmental awareness, education, and cultural preservation. This depth within the Emirate's priorities is of great interest to our local and international partners. Businesses and NGOs are focusing more on sustainable opportunities to cement their footprint in Sharjah. The Emirate of Sharjah has a broad geographical reach, from the US to New Zealand, and we are supporting initiatives between our government entities and international organizations to create mutually beneficial opportunities for the public and private sectors. One exciting point is the Technology and Innovation Park, which is being developed adjacent to Sharjah University City. As the home of higher education in the UAE, companies and international institutions are looking to set up facilities in the project for applied research and innovation. The many years invested in nurturing exceptional talent in the Emirate allows us to venture into research, development, and innovation. This is an example of how the Department of Government Relations ensures that Sharjah's international outreach program is aligned with the needs of the private and public sector in the Emirate. Working closely with all stakeholders in the government of Sharjah, we support international programs to export our thought leadership and identify opportunities for knowledge transfer.</p><h4>Despite instabilities in the Middle East and falling commodity prices, Sharjah's well-diversified economy has outperformed others in the region. What are your expectations for Sharjah's economy and what opportunities and challenges might it face in the near future?</h4><p>The sustainable development strategy of Sharjah was developed under the direction of HH Dr. Sheikh Sultan bin Mohammed Al Qasimi. It has been the primary reason for its resilience and continued growth. With the Emirate's consistent focus on a comprehensive economic and social development strategy, opportunities will continue to present themselves for the private and public sector to engage in this growth. Furthermore, the long-term focus on developing higher education has created new opportunities that are based on the large population of over 26,000 university students in the Emirate. It is a key differentiator that required the foresight of His Highness the Ruler when it was developed in 1997.</p><h4>What are the Department's goals and priorities for the year ahead?</h4><p>We are proud in Sharjah to be twinned with the city of Granada in Spain. This agreement was built upon the long-standing cultural and historical ties that we share with Spain. Our focus for the year ahead is to identify other twinning opportunities with cities that share our diligent focus on culture, education, and innovation. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why does iflix focus specifically on emerging markets?</h4><p>We are passionate about emerging markets. We believe the opportunities here are enormous. More than 3 billion people will enter the middle class over the next 15 years, and they will collectively purchase 1 billion new smartphones. This increasingly affluent group will be connected, and have access to information and cultural influences on a global scale. They will want to be entertained at a world class standard. At the moment, for many of these people, their only option is piracy. We founded iflix with the aim of offering consumers an alternative that is better than piracy. We envision bringing together the world's best content, with thousands of first run exclusive titles, current hit and iconic award winning TV series, blockbuster movies, popular local and regional content, children's programs, and more, to create a world-class service where users can both stream and download programs, all for an unbelievably low monthly price. When it came to pricing, instead of asking how much people would pay for this service, we chose instead to calculate what was the lowest we could feasibly charge and still build a viable business. Coming to emerging markets with this proposition and mentality, we realized we can offer an extraordinary product at extraordinary value.</p><h4>What made you decide to start your operations from Malaysia, and how is the startup ecosystem?</h4><p>Malaysia is an extraordinary country to do business in. We participate in a program called Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) that provides great incentives and support for international startup firms like us, including facilitating the recruitment of foreign talent through visa access, and  connecting us with the larger ecosystem fostered by organizations like MDEC, from which we receive key assistance on education and promotion. Kuala Lumpur is a culturally open, global commercial, and financial hub, with high educational standards and many international schools. This makes the city attractive for expatriate assignments. Furthermore, the relative cost of doing business is low while the ease of doing business is high. The pool of global talent available is also significant. Approximately 30,000 Malaysian graduates with an overseas tertiary degree, international experience and business perspective repatriate each year with the aim of continuing their careers back home. A considerable percentage of our team fits this exact profile. As we continue our rapid growth, expanding into new markets, it is a great advantage to have this depth of talent, who are educated abroad with international backgrounds and networking experience.</p><h4>In addition to Malaysia, you are making progress on the regional expansion, could you brief us on the developments here?</h4><p>Our first bet was to attempt to build the entire product with world-class technology out of Malaysia, and we succeeded. Our experiences and learnings here have given us an extraordinary understanding of consumer demands in emerging markets broadly, and the challenges which need to be overcome to fulfil those. In Asia, we are now live in Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia, Brunei, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives. Around the world, there is a band of countries that have a number of things in common: paid television penetration is low and internet connectivity is leapfrogging ahead—in some instances going from no connection at all, straight to 4G. Myanmar for example, has gone from 3 million mobile users in 2014 to 45 million this year, and almost all are using 3G or 4G. Unlike markets such as India, there is no incumbent base of old technology that needs to be upgraded here—everyone can and does immediately move to the latest technology available. Our footprint is a global set of markets which all meet these criteria, including Iran, Egypt, Morocco, Nigeria, Kenya, and Ghana. These countries are culturally diverse, but they all share similar levels of infrastructure development and market dynamics. The first phone that many people in these markets have access to is a smartphone, which additionally has the capabilities of a supercomputer, and is used as a remote control for in their daily lives. The world has moved to a stage where people watch what they want, when they want and in emerging markets, people watch it in the palm of their hands—that is where we position iflix.</p><h4>How do you deal with piracy issues?</h4><p>Piracy is not a moral question in most emerging markets; it is rather a matter of convenience and availability. People don't actively want to steal; they just want to watch the latest television shows and movies. The question is then, how do we meet those demands so they don't have to resort to stealing. Looking at this dynamic, there are a few differences between movies and television shows to consider when looking at online piracy. Movies typically only have one single file, whereas television shows consists of multiple episodes and seasons. In short, pirating any television series can be very inconvenient and complicated from a consumer standpoint. iflix allows any user to download up to 10 episodes of any show directly to your mobile device and watch them whenever and wherever you want, on or offline. In addition, we work closely with local telco providers to integrate our services seamlessly with their mobile and broadband services. For example, with TM, Digi, and Maxis, customers receive iflix with their subscriptions.</p><h4>Do you envision similar partnerships with telco operators in foreign markets as well?</h4><p>The telecommunications landscape is going through an enormous shift with providers across the board prioritizing data and entertainment services to enrich their customer offering. It has become increasingly important to build this emotional connection between the brand and the client beyond just selling them sim cards. We currently work with a number of other providers in our operating markets under this premise, and we anticipate the continued growth of this trend, with deeper relationships between telcos and content providers in the foreseeable future.</p><h4>What are your ambitions for the next two years?</h4><p>We are expanding our global footprint. Within the next two years we aim to reach the next billion people with smartphone and provide them access to a legal, world-class entertainment service. Our challenge will be to educate people about the benefits and advantages of Internet TV in regions where piracy is the norm. This is a collective effort by us, our studio partners, telecommunications companies, and governments. The media landscape is no longer a locally controlled environment. Social platforms like YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook are now mainstream channels for political discussion, entertainment, and user-generated content. Governments around the world are trying to find a balance between the global community and local culture. As part of the equation, we need to continue to navigate that evolution and contribute to that discussion. Other than that, we are excited to announce that we will be launching our first production in the coming year.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The UAE and Australia entered an agreement on Cooperation in the Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy in 2014. How has this improved bilateral relations between the two countries so far?</h4><p>The nuclear cooperation agreement has added another important strand to our strategic bilateral relationship with the UAE as it moves to adopt ambitious targets for low carbon energy production, and reduce its reliance on oil. The UAE is already our largest trading partner in the Middle East. The Australia-UAE Agreement on Cooperation in the Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy is necessary for Australian uranium to be used in civilian nuclear power generation in the UAE. Bilateral nuclear cooperation agreements set out strict conditions for the peaceful use, safeguarding, and security of Australian uranium supply.</p><h4>In 2015, UAE investment in Australia amounted to AUD12.5 billion (AED35.25 billion), with sovereign wealth funds such as the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) being the major investors. What investment opportunities does Australia provide, particularly for the UAE's private sector?</h4><p>The UAE is already a significant investor in Australia, particularly through sovereign wealth funds like the ADIA, which became the largest hotel owner in Australia with its 2103 purchase of 31 Accor-branded hotels. Total UAE investment in Australia was estimated at AUD12.5 billion in 2015. Looking to other opportunities, Australia is currently undertaking major infrastructure investments, and looking for foreign investors to participate in a wide range of projects including roads, rail, dams and other water infrastructure. I encourage UAE investors to consider the opportunities offered for partnerships in such projects right across Australia. There is also a particular focus on developing northern Australia in this regard, and Australia now has a dedicated Minister for Northern Australia, Senator the Hon. Matt Canavan.</p><h4>Earlier in 2016, Sharjah's great investment potential in sectors such as tourism, environment, health, and transport was promoted at a Sharjah-Australia business roundtable. How will the Emirate's rewarding business climate increase opportunities for Australian investors, and which sector looks the most promising?</h4><p>Australia is aware that the UAE is the second largest economy in the Middle East after Saudi Arabia, and that the UAE has been building on its traditional oil and gas wealth by diversifying into new economic activities. There are already over 360 Australian companies with a presence in the UAE and working in a range of sectors, including in agricultural supplies and services. There are now 130 return air flights per week operating between the UAE and Australia; therefore, there are expanding opportunities for commercial contact and two-way tourism.</p><h4>Despite socio-political turbulence and falling commodity prices in the MENA region, the UAE remains the most stable and diversified economy. What is your outlook for the UAE in the medium term, and how do you envision future relations between Australia and the UAE?</h4><p>The UAE is Australia's largest trading partner in the Middle East and 16th largest overall, with two-way goods and services trade worth AUD8.8 billion in 2015. As the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources, naturally I take a particular interest in our bilateral agricultural and food trade including related services trade. Australia will remain a reliable supplier of safe and high quality food and agricultural products to the UAE. Australia exported AUD913.2 million of agricultural goods to UAE in 2015. The top 5 agricultural exports to the UAE in 2015 were sheep meat (AUD190.4 million), beef (AUD 97.6 million), rape or colza (AUD 92.8 million), almonds (AUD 72.6 million), and dairy preparations (AUD 68.2 million). </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In recent years, the UAE has delivered nearly half of the foreign aid budget for developing projects in Egypt. How crucial has UAE aid been in stabilizing Egypt and promoting development?</h4><p>Egypt and the UAE have always shared special and close relations at both official and popular levels. Today, ties between the two Arab nations are developing on all fronts at an unprecedented rate and are considered a model upon which inter-Arab relations should be styled. During recent years, the UAE has become one of Egypt's most important strategic allies as well as a key development partner. Following the revolution on June 30, 2013, a framework agreement was signed between the two countries by virtue of which the UAE supported the implementation of development projects in vital sectors including energy, housing, education, healthcare, transportation, infrastructure, and food security, in addition to industrial staff training and strategic studies. Talks are also underway with the UAE to finance projects implemented under the Sinai Peninsula Development Project. The UAE's support of Egypt's development plans has been useful, and we look forward to continued collaboration and witnessing the implementation of a number of megaprojects aimed at boosting the economy and fostering Egypt's stability.</p><h4>The new Suez Canal opened in 2015. Has Egypt seen interest from the UAE to develop special economic zones near the canal, like Sharjah, which has developed efficient business-friendly centers for industry?</h4><p>The Suez Canal corridor is one of the most prominent projects in Egypt. In November 2015, we launched the first phase of the Suez Canal Area Development Project. The project envisages the promotion of special economic zones and industrial areas. Work is now underway on the infrastructure in the area to turn it into an international investment destination, a global logistics hub, and an industrial center for the new Egypt. As an integral part of this vision, the government is currently reviewing the special economic zones law to improve the tax and investment incentives offered to investors in these zones. The UAE was at the forefront of countries showing interest in this ambitious project, given its commitment to supporting Egypt's comprehensive economic and social development process as well as its successful experience in managing special economic zones. The Emirati interest in the Suez Canal project started early in Phase I, where Abu Dhabi's National Marine Dredging Company was instrumental in delivering the New Suez Canal on time, leading a consortium of four of the world's largest dredging contractors. Momentum has now switched to Phase II of the project, the new special economic zones, which offer a huge opportunity for the UAE, particularly the private sector, to set up industrial parks and logistics hub. I met with several groups of Emirati businessmen and investors over past years and discussed with them the diverse business and investment opportunities offered by Egypt as well as steps and measures undertaken by the government to offer an environment conducive to more investment and to eliminate bureaucratic impediments. They showed great interest and commitment to increasing their investments in Egypt, and we are currently cooperating with them in order to translate this interest into tangible actions and projects that would be of mutual benefit for both sides.</p><h4>How do you envision future relations between Egypt and the UAE?</h4><p>At the bilateral level, Egypt and the UAE will continue to strengthen the political, economic, cultural, and social ties that have been established since the UAE's independence in 1971. There is a large Egyptian expatriate community in the UAE, which has positively contributed to its development and modernization process during the past decades, and many Emiratis have a strong affinity to Egypt, where they have received their education at Egyptian universities and enjoyed some of Egypt's most attractive tourist destinations. The political leadership in both countries is interested in seeing these relations further prosper and flourish to serve their mutual and regional interests. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does Invertir utilize PPPs? </h4><p>Around the world we know the PPP structure. In Peru, we work in two other forms of PPP. The first is Obras por Impuestos, which is an investment against taxes. This is when a private company invests in a public facility or utility and the amount of the investment is deducted from their taxes. There are, of course, a few laws surrounding this possibility; it is an extraordinary mechanism to involve the private sector in public investment. We have problems with public management in regions and municipalities within the federal government in Peru wherein despite great management of public finances Peruvian officers do not execute the budget. This fact shows a lack of management skills at different levels of the government. PPP have been created to avoid this kind of problem and to develop infrastructure with private-oriented management.</p><h4>What are the keys to a successful Obras por Impuestos (OxI) deal?</h4><p>For an OxI to be successful, it is important to match interests. The first is finding a company that is willing to make a social investment in issues like a school or water facilities. It must be willing to work with people associated with this investment and put down cash on the table. The company cannot recover the taxes until after the investment is made so it must put down money upfront; for a successful OxI it is important that a company that is financially willing to do so. This has been interesting for certain companies here because they only think about social responsibility and the importance of having it in our country. This is a new world within local governments. In 2015, the window was opened to work on OxI with the central government budget. After these pieces are in place governments have to work with reliable companies, like ours. They need to work with reliable construction companies and reliable consultants in order to be successful. For example, if the consultants are just as bad at the public managers, this increases the risk of not recovering investments. </p><h4>Which projects have been particularly successful? </h4><p>We are working on water and sanitary facilities in the north of Peru. We are also working on schools in Arequipa. We are additionally prospecting a hospital in the rainforest, and so on. It is easier to work when the local government has the budget needed. It is easier with local governments; the bureaucratic process with the central government is still a little more complicated.</p><h4>What are some of the challenges that you face while working on OxI?</h4><p>Our greatest challenge is encouraging the government to be more proactive and to work closer with the private sector. In Peru, there is often a lack of trust between bureaucrats and the private sector. There are also problems with corruption. This is another challenge that we face. But if we continue this mechanism to work together, we will continue to improve. We have not seen another country in the world with this mechanism. Combining the management skills of the private sector to benefit an entire society is mutually beneficial</p><h4>What are your main goals for 2016 and the future?</h4><p>The new government is committed to solving the lack of infrastructure. It wants to create a more efficient state. We hope to grow and push the economy much more with this new government. We made the market-oriented reforms but did not do the second-generation reform. We need greater reforms in health, education, the judiciary, security, and, of course, infrastructure. Overall, we need a more proactive state and that is our greatest challenge to remain the most dynamic country in Latin America. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did you first start Z&amp;C Lawyers and how has the firm positioned itself in the Peruvian legal sector?</h4><p>After working for more than 20 years in the public and private sectors, César Candela and César Zavala decided to form Z&amp;C Abogados in order to offer their services to local and international private companies looking to strengthen their relations with the public sector. Sine then our firm has grown 20% every year. We offer our clients the expertise of our associates and law professionals.</p><h4>What is your main client profile?</h4><p>Our clients are from various countries, including Spain, Chile, Brazil, Colombia, Argentina, Mexico, the US, and Italy, among others. They come to us for support in building branches or subsidiaries, legal advice on tax, corporate, labor, customs, contract, tenders, private, and public initiatives, arbitration, and other areas of law.</p><h4>How would you characterize the regulatory environment for international companies looking to do business in Peru?</h4><p>For any company that wants to start operations or develop its business in Peru, there is an attractive legal framework and legal stability necessary to ensuring that its rights are respected at all times. Business opportunities in Peru are extraordinary. The public sector has billions of dollars to invest in infrastructure (roads, bridges, hospitals, schools), but it needs companies to come that can provide expertise, technology, and a high level of human resources. As a developing country and one of the strongest economies in South America, we also deal with bureaucracy through the enactment and approval of laws that accelerate the procedures any investor must deal with.</p><h4>What is the importance of your affiliations with international legal associations and chambers of commerce for the firm's business?</h4><p>Our firm is affiliated with several chambers of commerce in addition to the international association of lawyers. These are excellent ways to expand our capacity to work with foreign companies interested in developing activities in our country, expanding our network of contacts and, of course, working to the renown of our firm's good name.</p><h4>What are the advantages of working with a local legal partner for international companies doing business in Peru?</h4><p>Undoubtedly, a national law firm guarantees a certain level of knowledge and expertise of how local public entities function that is otherwise inaccessible. It also guarantees an expertise of the criteria used by public servants, which in many cases goes accordingly with their education and professional capacity.</p><h4>What distinguishes Z&amp;C Lawyers from other firms offering similar services?</h4><p>To begin with, our partners offer advisory services directly and personally. Secondly we have extensive experience in the public sector, with several of our lawyers having had the opportunity to work directly with the President of the Republic between 2006 and 2011. We have also held positions in other public entities such as the National Parliament and Directories. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Delfin has pioneered expedition cruise tourism in the Peruvian Amazon region over the last decade. What are the opportunities available for companies operating in this sector?</h4><p>Peru has different climatic, cultural, geographical, and archeological areas that are unique and varied in their potential to become important destinations. Not to mention its wildlife. And tourism is defined by products and experiences rather than businesses. In Peru many make the mistake of reducing tourism to luxury hotels, convenience, or comfort. What we need to do is implement programs with far more emphasis on cultural, historic, and architectural heritage, and avoid the trap that other countries have fallen into with shoddy construction in otherwise historic districts because of a lack of a master plan or central administration, thereby destroying their potential as international travel markets. For example, Mexico and parts of Central America have combined the financial efforts of the central government and the private sector to “rescue" much of their culture, history, architecture, and authenticity by restoring their main squares as well as the surrounding buildings. The private sector then committed to developing small boutique hotels and restaurants, each of which were restored using original materials and architectural designs. And it worked, turning these towns into unique and extremely authentic new destinations true to their essence and particular feel. We must renovate what needs to be renovated, regenerate city centers where needed, as well as add infrastructure such as boutique accommodation, mandatorily rescuing their true architectural essence.</p><h4>What segment do you target at Delfin?</h4><p>We target the high-end segment because that is not only where we are most comfortable in terms of risk, revenue generation, and profitability, but, equally importantly, because it is the kind of tourism that needs to be developed for Peru to become a major tourism destination. It is also important for conservation and preservation. All of Peru's most famous, precious, and popular destinations are located in places that cannot handle large numbers of tourists. Machu Picchu, Arequipa, Nazca, Trujillo, and Chiclayo are all fantastic sites but are fragile and cannot sustain large volumes.</p><h4>How do you overcome the lack of qualified personnel and human resources in Peru?</h4><p>Tourism is not generally considered a viable career for well-educated professionals, so finding the right people can be difficult. And yet you have to be every bit as professional in tourism as any other sector, especially if you want to grow, improve, and prosper. Unfortunately, the schools that offer tourism courses do not provide an adequate curriculum. They need to become more corporate. The regulations, taxes, and legal framework all require highly trained, dedicated, and topnotch professionals. We also need to lay the framework for a better, more centralized, more efficient decision-making apparatus that has the capacity to create and follow strategic long-term visions. Countries like Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Argentina, Brazil, Panama, and Costa Rica are far ahead of us in this regard, and they have nowhere near the destinations that Peru does.</p><h4>What is your strategy for consolidating your business over the short term?</h4><p>Our Expedition Cruise products are already well recognized in the international market. However, while our focus is always to maintain a high level of service, top quality products, and infrastructure, and the best cost efficiency basis possible, we are also prepared to expand our business beyond this consolidated stage. For this we have already analyzed several investment projects that are ready to be implemented from 2016 onwards. However, we will only invest in these new projects when we see how the new government addresses the challenges facing the country's tourism sector and how the regional and global economies develop. We plan to expand and diversify our offering of products—including the risks and mitigations this entails—in the coming years. This includes projects in both Peru and Central America. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What factors accounted for the 7-8% YoY growth in tourist arrivals that Peru saw in 2015?</h4><p>We have worked on strategies based on medium-term periods of three years. We have monitoring offices that regularly update us on what is happening in our markets of interest. This enables us to spot trends and react quickly to decreases in the number of tourists from one market to better target other ones. Based on this, we have implemented several campaigns targeting specific market segments that have different growth potential. Peru has maintained an interesting growth in the last decade, but the challenge has always been to keep ahead of the curve.</p><h4>How has FDI evolved in the tourism industry in the last few years?</h4><p>In terms of FDI in infrastructure, there are over 10 hotel projects in Lima alone for 2016. We have seen a positive trend overall, all linked to the increasing attractiveness of our country, which has achieved more than satisfactory growth at the social and economic levels, as well as political stability and security. Legislation regarding FDI in the tourism sector has also improved, making the sector more attractive for investors. This encouraged investment in that area, and we now have more flights from the north and the south to the Amazon region.</p><h4>How could an influx of Asian tourists alter the Peruvian tourism industry?</h4><p>We have been actively working the Asian market for the last three years. We directed our efforts at the Chinese, Korean, and Taiwanese markets and have seen positive results in these markets; last year, Korean tourists alone increased 33.8%. For this strategy, we mainly used commercial channels to target the Chinese and Korean markets through tour operators and specialized tourism packages. Machu Picchu is, and will continue to be, one of the main attractions Peru can offer these long-distance travelers.</p><h4>What is the potential of MICE tourism for Peru?</h4><p>Currently, MICE is one of our main focuses of growth. In the last few years, we have had a presence in the main international fairs and events focused on this particular segment. Since 2014, we have also strengthened our strategies and now we are working to attract international events. We have targeted over 150 institutions and organizations to bid for potential events. We have also managed to improve the country's position in international rankings within the MICE segment, as well as that of some of our cities. Arequipa, Cusco, Lima, and Ica are some of the areas with the most potential in this segment. We also try to consolidate the so-called Convention Bureau in the main cities across the country. This consolidation is key to increasing the promotion of the areas and the strategy behind that.</p><h4>How would you assess the sector's human resources?</h4><p>Education and training are two key factors in the sector that get addressed through both the public and the private sector. The technical part of our human resources is important. This becomes more relevant as the sector develops and expands its area of influence. We need to secure the balance between the specialized, skilled, and technical workers that the tourism sectors needs. The sector also seeks to boost the development of the human resource factor in areas with the greatest potential. We need to be ready to meet the demands of the market as this evolves, and search for areas of specialization.</p><h4>What are your objectives for 2016?</h4><p>We want to maintain our growth rate from 2015, as well as to keep growing and positioning Peru in the Asian market. We will strengthen our relation with the sector and continue our search for partnerships and alliances when it comes to multi-destination packages. We need to further leverage the long-distance air connections we have while searching for complementary trends with other countries and encouraging those people on transfer to stay here. We will also continue our work on regional markets as well as the US with digital marketing tools. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been RAK Properties' landmark projects?</h4><p>RAK Properties was established thanks to the vision of His Highness, Sheikh Saud Bin Saqr Al Qasimi. At the time of inception we were seeking AED1 billion, but when we announced it demand far exceeded our expectations. Everyone wanted to participate and we ultimately reached AED56 billion. We discussed this with His Highness and decided to aim for AED2 billion and return the extra money back to investors. After that, we registered our company on the Security and Commodities Authority in the UAE because it is a public shareholding company. Our first projects were the Julphar Towers, where our offices are located, and Mina Al Arab, our biggest project. We started with the infrastructure of Mina Al Arab and the first phase of villas and apartments, which cost approximately AED1 billion. The plan at that time was to spend about AED10 billion on Mina Al Arab. There are about nine hotels planned along the coast, together with a big mall in a specific area of the development as well. Unfortunately, by the time we were going to float a tender for these projects, the economic crisis hit in 2008. By that time, we finished and launched the first part of Mina Al Arab. Now we have around 2,500 units completed to date. Furthermore, around this time, we finished the RAK Tower development in Abu Dhabi, which sold out completely.</p><h4>How do you evaluate the market for eco-themed mixed-use projects such as Mina Al Arab in RAK?</h4><p>These types of properties are ideal because Ras Al Khaimah has not previously had high-quality buildings, gated communities, or mixed-used developments. We decided on building hotels, malls, high-class villas, and medium-class apartments. The only difficulty we had was during the financial crisis. Otherwise, whatever we launched was sold at the time of sale. The demand was very high before 2008. After the crisis, we changed strategy and decided to follow market trends, which was affordable housing. From now onward, we hope that the domestic real estate sector will continue to improve, although there are many economic difficulties and much instability in the region. And yet our country is different because of the great infrastructure. We have 221 nationalities living peacefully, and there are no problems. We have around 10 million visitors in the UAE every year. In Ras Al Khaimah we have a different topography from the rest of the UAE because we have the mountains, the sea, and the sand dunes. We are also close to Dubai, just 45 minutes away. All this adds value. Also, we have a well-established free trade zone authority and they are attracting many investors, which encourages us to pursue new projects. Anantara Resort and Spa is already announced and under design, and will hopefully be completed by the end of 2018. We will also have another hotel coming online and we are currently in the process of finalizing that. We are also completing a masterplan for a huge mixed-use project in this area. This year we are developing the concept and then we will establish the details and tendering. There will be two hotels, a mall, beautiful residential apartments, villas, and along the beach there will a vibrant promenade lined with al fresco dining outlets, as well as retail and entertainment zones. There will be a lot of activity directly by the beach.</p><h4>Why have you decided to expand beyond Ras Al Khaimah?</h4><p>The UAE is unified space and the Emirates complement each other. Whatever we do in Dubai or Abu Dhabi complements Ras Al Khaimah.</p><h4>What trends have you identified that will affect your approach to future projects?</h4><p>Ras Al Khaimah is a rapidly-growing tourist destination, which is why we need to increase the number of hotels. I wish I had started hotels eight years ago. Another factor is that high-end homes are at the point of saturation. Mid-market houses are in demand now. There is demand in the high-end market, but people want beachfront properties. The majority would like to have an affordable apartment or villa, so that is what we are now taking into consideration. Also, maybe people look for the quality of shops in the area that add to the destination, like Tim Hortons, Starbucks, and so on. This adds value to your projects.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[in-full-flight]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why has Interjet decided to make the transformation to become a fully international airline?</h4><p>I think it was a totally natural movement. We started flying in December 2005 and by 2008 were already in Mexico City's international airport. We were able to demonstrate and compete wing to wing with our competition, all well-established carriers. By the end of 2013 we had already consolidated our position in the domestic market of Mexico, we practically covered most of Mexico and we were the second largest Mexican carrier. Since 2011 we have started an intense internationalization and 100% of our growth has been overseas in the past two years. In the case of the US, we could not really expand internationally because we had several limitations. In Mexico-US air transportation there was a bilateral agreement that imposed limitations, allowing only two carriers to transport passengers from Mexico to the US and vice versa. Legally, we struggled against that and lobbied in Washington and Mexico since it was against fair competition. Eventually Mexico agreed upon a temporary solution with the US and began issuing temporary renewable yearly permits, which put us in a difficult position because we could not make major investments in such fragile legal conditions. Fortunately that situation is now over with the open skies agreement. We went first to the US before having more or less the same problem with other Latin American countries. The bilateral agreements that Mexico had with Guatemala, Colombia, Costa Rica, and Peru imposed certain limitations and made it difficult for us to gain entrance. We have not abandoned the Mexican domestic market.</p><h4>How has the open skies agreement benefited Interjet in terms of flights to the US?</h4><p>We are now in the US with new bilateral agreements flying to New York, Miami, Orlando Sanford, Houston, Dallas/Fort Worth, San Antonio, Las Vegas, Chicago, and Los Angeles. In the wintertime we will be going to Denver for the Mexican skiers. All across Latin America, Mexico has bilateral agreements with different countries, and we still have to deal with the existing terms of each agreement.</p><h4>Are you aiming to continue expansion into other countries?</h4><p>Guatemala was our very first international operation. We opened our first service into Guatemala and then followed up with Costa Rica. We then opened a route to Bogotá in Colombia, which has been successful with two flights a day. We now also fly to Lima in Peru. In the Caribbean, Interjet is the leading Mexican airline covering Cuba and serves Havana, Varadero, and Santa Clara. Once tourism picks up in Cuba, this will be a huge opportunity for us. Canada it has always been a great market until around eight years ago when the Canadian government imposed a visa on Mexican visitors, tremendously limiting the amount of people from both countries. When the visa requirement is lifted on December 1, we will not only expand from Mexico City but from Guadalajara, Cancún, and Monterrey as well. It is an important market with great potential.</p><h4>What portion of your flights is international and what is Interjet's strategy to grow in this segment?</h4><p>Around 35% of our flights are international, but our goal is to reach 50%. When we started we were 100% domestic and thus heavily exposed to every impact of the rate of exchange. Though we are now moving into a more reasonable situation, we are still 50% behind our goal. Therefore, we will see a lot of international growth for Interjet in the future. In Mexico we have a much consolidated presence and leadership through our extensive network of routes, the national market is also very representative and since the economy is growing fast and air transportation is becoming a natural way to travel.</p><h4>Are you concerned by the increase in low-cost airline competition?</h4><p>Competition is everything in modern life. Obviously, competing and winning are important, and to win you have to be fit, and competition always brings innovation and new ways of doing things your own way. We provide a service somewhere between business and premium class at the competitive price of economy. We need people to try and test the experience. When they do so and are satisfied, it is very likely they will return to us rather than the competition. We compete against the biggest airlines in the world, and while I am not saying we are winning, we are doing very well.</p><h4>What is the importance of your airline alliance expansion and what type of global footprint do you want to have?</h4><p>We do not have the right airplanes to go across the Atlantic, or even south to Argentina, Brazil, or Chile. The furthest destination we can reach is Lima. In the meantime, we can expand through our associates and partners. We are providing what is called domestic distribution for our partners. So far, their customers have been highly satisfied with Interjet. If they arrive in business class, they see no difference. We are providing a distribution service in Mexico and vice versa, sending Mexican people to Spain, Italy, and England. We now have partnerships with eight carriers in Latin America. When we fly to Lima, we leave Mexicans there and let our partners take them to destinations we cannot reach. This also works in reverse when we pick up passengers in Lima and take them to New York or Los Angeles. It is another way of internationalizing whether direct or indirect. American Airlines is our partner in the US, though we are competing with it directly on several routes very important to them, such as Dallas, Miami, and Los Angeles, the most important American hubs for Mexico.</p><h4>What is your vision for Interjet in Mexico, the Americas and the wider world in the next five years?</h4><p>When we started our business plan back in 2005, we thought it was aggressive. We had only 17 aircraft and 12% of total market share of Mexico. Today we have 70 aircraft and have leaped to over 20% domestic and 20% international market share. We took the opportunities the industry allowed us to, though for others we forced the issue and created our own dynamic. We are now the beneficiaries of those dynamics. What the next few years will bring, is hard to tell. No doubt Mexico—US air traffic will grow considerably, so we will continue to play a key role there in the US, and our market in Latin America will continue to grow. We will have to decide what to do in the upper and lower areas because we can expand into long-haul routes with bigger airplanes and go transcontinental. This is a big leap that I do not think we are yet prepared for. That said, 10 years ago we were not prepared to be where we are now. We have to keep an open mind and open attitude towards business and if we decide to take such a jump it will come with a lot of challenges and difficulties. Then there is of course our focus on Mexico, which has great potential for growth.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How are things changing in Peru's education sector?</h4><p>The education sector is crucial for the economic development of this country. Yet the Peruvian postgraduate system is poorly positioned in Latin America, and quality must be increased. This is closely related to teachers' academic level and the need to update the curricula, infrastructure and equipment, all of which are necessary to improving the conditions of teaching, learning, and scientific research. And no matter the cost, all Peruvian universities must be subject to quality assessments.</p><h4>How would you characterize access to higher education in the country?</h4><p>The two biggest challenges are school costs and lack of proximity. For this reason, CENTRUM Católica is in 10 of the country's largest cities, namely Lima, Piura, Chiclayo, Trujillo, Cajamarca, Huancayo, Arequipa, Cusco, Ica, and Tarapoto.</p><h4>What are the main milestones that CENTRUM has achieved in the past years? </h4><p>The quality of a business school is reflected in its accreditation, and the main business school accreditation associations are AACSB, EQUIS, and AMBA. In 2011, CENTRUM Católica became the first business school in Peru to obtain the accreditation of all three, the “Triple Crown."</p><h4>In terms of academic programs, what additions have you recently made to keep CENTRUM competitive? </h4><p>In 2014, we launched an MBA program with a tri-continental component that includes five months of courses in two business schools in North America and Europe, as well as intensive co-participation with students from around the world who spend seven months at CENTRUM Católica. This year we are launching a double MBA and MSc in food management, an intense bilingual program aimed at executives in the global food industry that want to strengthen their managerial skills.</p><h4>In which research areas is CENTRUM supporting the country's development?</h4><p>CENTRUM Research has several research centers specialized in the areas of competitiveness: finance and economics, leadership, innovation and strategy, social responsibility, entrepreneurship and sustainability, and industry and marketing. All of these strike a fine balance between academic and applied research in their concern for the needs and betterment of society within the larger framework of advancing Christian values. We also organize an international conference every year to stimulate cooperation among academics, practitioners, and diplomats, in addition to organizing various international workshops and industrial outreach management development programs.</p><h4>How does CENTRUM build a bridge between the education sector and the business community?</h4><p>CENTRUM graduates are the best-qualified workforce in Peru, and the school has dozens of agreements with public and private sector organizations to make these bridges work. CENTRUM students have developed strategic plans for Peru's regions and Lima's districts, industrial sectors, products, and service sectors. CENTRUM also has in-house customized programs designed to match companies' particular needs such as project management, bank services marketing, management development, and business negotiation and conflict management with major clients such as IBM, 3M, and Samsung.</p><h4>How do you position CENTRUM in the international arena? </h4><p>CENTRUM Católica has agreements with nearly 50 different partner schools from around the world. This includes Tulane University, Babson College, Pepperdine University, Université Laval, the University of Calgary, the Maastricht School of Management, IE Business School (Spain), Escuela de Alta Dirección y Administración (EADA), and the Grenoble École de Management.</p><h4>What are your main goals and targets for 2015?</h4><p>CENTRUM is working hard to position itself among the top-50 business schools in the world by strengthening its relationships and programs, increasing its production of research, and gradually having all our programs taught in English. To do this, we are currently adding a 15,000sqm campus expansion and have installed interactive blackboards, smart projectors, and new video conference equipment in all our classrooms. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is demand for aesthetic treatment evolving in Peru?</h4><p>Our client profile is evolving along with demand. Two decades ago the client profile was 95% women and 5% men, while today it is 40% men and 60% women. In terms of age, 40% of our clients are between 18 and 36 years old and 60% are in the 36-70 year old range. Image is a fundamental component of contemporary society: many of our clients are executives seeking special aesthetic treatments. Approximately 55% of the Clinica Morillas' clients are from the highest socioeconomic strata. This clinic is highly ranked in the city, so our client profile is high.</p><h4>How do you shape your competitive advantages and how are your clinics positioned within the industry?</h4><p>About 41% of our clientele is international; 70% of our international customers are from the US while the remaining 30% are from Europe. This is good for us, because these clients are different from our Peruvian clients; one difference is that they do not discuss the price. International clients accept the price because they only want security, which is a great difference from the Peruvian clients, most of whom tend to haggle and are not concerned about the security of the procedure. Safety is a priority for us, and we invest a great deal in equipment and technology and send our doctors abroad for courses and training on security and techniques. All our physicians are trained within the clinic, and we have certain agreements with different universities and they send us the best student physicians. If a physician wants to study to be a plastic surgeon, the first of their tests are conducted here in this clinic, and all the physicians working here spend their first three years with us. We assure two things when it comes to the safety of our customers: techniques, which are standard for all of our physicians, and our protocols. The clinic specializes in abdominoplasty, prostheses like mammoplasty, and gluteoplasty, liposuction, facial rejuvenation, among others. In Peru rhinoplasty is the most common procedure because of our morphological structure.</p><h4>How do you compete with other Latin American countries to make Peru an appealing destination among the international community?</h4><p>We understand that people from abroad seek security and safety standards, so that is our goal and what we give them. The second point is our price, which is high; however, the value that accompanies it is justified and that is how we remain competitive in the industry.</p><h4>On average, how long does a patient stay in the clinic?</h4><p>The procedures themselves are quick, and patients are here for no more than two days. Some patients come from abroad, so we pick them up at the airport and bring them here. Sometimes they stay for 10 days, the first two being for medical reasons, and the remaining eight days are because they want to stay here as our facility is more comfortable than a hotel. This clinic has a spa atmosphere and is done up in the style of a colonial house. Dr. Morillas, for example, always says the best equation is a great doctor and a great clinic. If clients go to a building with offices inside and find plastic surgery facilities, then that is not ideal.</p><h4>In addition to the expansion of the clinic, what other highlights will characterize the activity of Clinica Morillas in 2016?</h4><p>We will initiate a USD70 million investment in the next six months that will be completed by 2018. This investment will be made to our current 5,000sqm location. We are currently working on the legal issues related to the expansion. Our aim is to continue growing; in the last four years the industry grew 13% while we grew 18%. We have surpassed the average. There is a great deal of competition in the market, which is also positive, because we want competition. Our first goal is to maintain this 18% growth at the minimum. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the major lessons learned from the acquisition of Al Noor up to now?</h4><p>Firstly, Abu Dhabi is a very different business environment from Dubai. We could not just go into Abu Dhabi and implement what we do in Dubai. The differences are vast in terms of the economic situation, the regulatory environment, government involvement, and the medical insurance market. We anticipated most of this beforehand, but the impact on the business has been greater than we expected. A major challenge has been the integration of the people and the distinct cultures of the two companies. We have retrenched over 400 people from the Al Noor campus in this integration and removed a lot of duplicate roles. Many of the facilities that we acquired need upgrading, the company was partially owned by a private equity company, which often results in delayed spending when they are going to sell it. We have also been working hard to get the right people in place in the right positions, which naturally takes time.</p><h4>The Health Authority Abu Dhabi has reduced insurance coverage for Emiratis under the Thiqa plan and for expatriates and their families under Daman Insurance's Abu Dhabi Basic Plan. What effect has this had?</h4><p>It has had a very significant impact on our business and has made us reconsider future investments. Regarding Thiqa coverage specifically, which was announced on July 1, 2016, for all Thiqa members, there would be 20% co-payment in the Abu Dhabi private sector and a 50% co-payment in Dubai. It is basically a directive to use government and semi-government (Mubadala) hospitals, which could be viewed as an anti-private move. We think that whilst a co-payment is an effective mechanism to manage utilization, it needs to be applied to the entire healthcare industry, needs to be enforced and it should exclude certain uncontrollable services (such as oncology). The only providers currently exempt from collecting the co-payments are the Cleveland Clinic and Mubadala facilities, which obviously does not allow for a level playing field within the private sector.</p><h4>What initiatives could be taken to achieve a more sustainable healthcare system?</h4><p>There needs to be more of a focus on ethics and quality. To manage quality you need a proper ethical framework and environment, this should be the biggest focus of the regulators in my view. There is a lot of corruption and fraud in the Abu Dhabi and Dubai healthcare market amongst certain providers, such as payment for referrals, payment for tests, non-collection of co-payments etc., which Mediclinic does not tolerate or advocate. This is causing big problems in terms of quality and in terms of cost. Incorrectly aligned incentives such as payment for referrals and test results in overutilization and thus inflates the cost. The second issue is price. Prices are too low in the Abu Dhabi market and people need to realize that if they want quality healthcare they will have to pay for it at a correctly-pitched price. If there was a stronger focus on ethics, the utilzation and costs would come down and this would allow for a better price. That is why only correctly-priced medical insurance networks support patients visiting Mediclinic facilities in Dubai. You cannot get to Mediclinic if you are on a AED600 a year health insurance premium, it is quite simple to calculate that those metrics will never stack up.</p><h4>In what ways did the acquisition of Al Noor create more value for your shareholders?</h4><p>It actually lost value for our shareholders in the short term because we paid a high price for Al Noor, but that is what you pay for healthcare companies these days. What the acquisition did do was to give us the ability to list in London and to grow the business. We used to be listed in Johannesburg, but the capital markets are a lot more fluid in London. Secondly, we were looking to grow in Abu Dhabi, and Al Noor was looking to grow in Dubai, so it made sense from a geographic point of view. It takes a long time to build a hospital, so if you can acquire a facility, upgrade it, and change it this would only take one or two years instead of five.</p><h4>What are your predictions for the healthcare sector in the UAE?</h4><p>You need to look at each emirate in isolation. In Dubai things will continue the way they have. Good progress has been made by the government, the regulatory environment is strong, and there are a lot of positive changes that the government is initiating. It will take longer than they reported to effect many of the changes as it is a massive challenge, the DRGs that were supposed to roll out in January 2017 has again been delayed, which is good because we need to do it properly and the regulators realize this. The UAE is also looking at a unified health record, which will take a long time, but it is a positive step in the right direction. From a healthcare perspective, the Dubai framework is good and is competitive, with no one medical insurance scheme dominating. There are a lot of new players entering the market, so there will be mergers and consolidations and the positive competition between providers and funders will ensure an increase in the quality. The Abu Dhabi healthcare market on the other hand is completely different, being dominated by government funding. Daman as an example is about 80% owned by the government, and they are the sole contributor accounting for 75% of all payments in Abu Dhabi. The funding landscape would improve significantly if it supported a more competitive environment, as is the case in Dubai. There are also too many facilities and there will thus be further consolidation required in this regard.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Health of the Country]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[health-of-the-country]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize the development of the health sector in Peru in the last few years?</h4><p>In the last few years, we have seen positive and important changes in the sector that contributed to its rapid development. For example, a few years ago the private health sector was made up of a small number of clinics run by few professionals. There was a concentration of clinics and two or three oligopolies. This changed to change in 2011, and we now see a consolidation. The banking sector has a strong presence here too through insurance companies as well as a nationwide clinic network. This is one of the realities of the health sector in Peru. Additionally, there has been a rapid development of integral health insurance in the country. Today, there are 16.5 million insured people, which represent two-thirds of the total population. In this context, we see a positive development of the public insurance and the universal health coverage. The public health sector has deteriorated due to poor budgets from the state as well as the lack of political interest to address the situation. The situation in the private sector is different. It is in a much stronger position. Overall, the development of universal coverage and health insurance, together with the presence of oligopolies and the increase in certain investments, have been the key to the development and progress of the health sector in Peru. For example, we saw the development of 103 new hospitals from 2011, with 54 to be completed. This is a good indicator of the development of the sector.</p><h4>How would you characterize the sector's human resources?</h4><p>This is one of the main challenges we face right now; there are not enough doctors in the country. Currently, the estimated cost for the state to train a doctor is around USD350,000. However, once they complete their studies they see no vacancies here to continue their specializations. There are no vacancies for all the graduates Peru has every year. The country does not have the economic muscle to guarantee a position for all of them. Another challenge we face has to do with the specialization of these doctors due to the lack of vacancies in the country. Currently, a third of the doctors become specialists; the other two-thirds end up with more generic training and no specialization. Most of these general doctors end up moving abroad in search of brighter opportunities—Europe, the US, and neighboring countries. The government needs to tackle this and provide the necessary positions and vacancies for young doctors to specialize, encouraging them to stay from a professional and economic point of view. </p><h4>How has the prevention culture in Peru developed in recent years?</h4><p>We currently have a rehabilitative health sector and culture, and it is important to invest in prevention as it considerably reduces costs in the long term. We aim to shift this culture to a more preventive culture and greater health awareness. We need to invest in education and promote health as basis of prevention. We need to reach schools and other organizations to educate people because we currently have the tools to achieve the desired change: healthier eating habits, more physical activity, and so on. In this context, we need to continue to fight extreme poverty and invest in providing drinking water to all the regions.</p><h4>What is your main objective for 2016?</h4><p>We have a legal responsibility toward public health. In this regard, the college is ready to work on the future of the sector to restructure the national health system. Our term finishes in 2018, and we will work hand in hand with the new government to achieve the abovementioned change in culture, as well as strengthen primary health services. We need to further contribute to the specialization of our doctors in order to improve the quality of the services the sector offers the population. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your operational strategy for 2016 for Arzan, and are there any further plans to diversify your operations?</h4><p>I took over this company at the end of 2011 when Arzan was a consumer finance company and was not performing well due to the 2008 financial crisis. At that time, my mandate was to turn the company around and to find a business model that suited the company's capabilities and the needs of the country. Over the past ten years, the government persistently had a surplus but the drop in oil prices led to a state deficit for 2015-16. However, the country still has a surplus from previous years. When I took over, we remodeled the company and found that consumer finance was too unpredictable and not profitable enough so we changed the model to that of a fully-fledged investment company. After that we thought about what the locals and expats in this country need and where they want to invest. The political and economic turbulence in the whole region led us to diversify our clients' legacy assets and investments to more stable countries. In fact, a lot of people got burnt in 2008 because of their mortgage investments in this region, especially in Kuwait. In 2007, the Kuwait index was reaching 15,000, but these days it is below 5,000. This gives an indication of how much wealth has been lost already. We started to think of where to take investors and how to restructure their investments, so first of all we turned this company into an investment company—the Arzan Financial Group. Then we changed the whole management, a new crew came in, and now we are focusing more on wealth and asset management. Since the establishment in 2013, Arzan Wealth has advised on the acquisition of assets worth for more than USD1 billion and continues to grow and advise on managing these assets. We also have a brokerage service in Kuwait, Jordan, and Egypt, as well as Arzan VC, our venture capital arm and the first of its kind in Kuwait and among the top in this region. In this regard, Arzan VC has not only established itself regionally, but is also our flagship. It is the only Kuwaiti company that provides this type of service and investment. It has an office in Silicon Valley and now Dubai and is further trying to offer a platform to different entrepreneurs from around the world who cooperate in one way or another. Arzan Wealth, on the other hand, is focused more on yielding investments for those families, offices for individuals, HNIs or for institutions that want to diversify the risk from the local and regional to more mature economies such as the US or Europe. Regarding the latter, the UK, Germany, Norway, and the Netherlands are the countries we invest in. Second, those kinds of assets are yielding in nature, which means that our clients' net worth is not only diversified but they also receive a monthly income with minimal risk. The average return on such assets is around 8% P.A. While the returns are higher in Norway, they are lower in the US. Consequently, we mainly diversify our investors' assets into dollars, pounds, and euros.</p><h4>What are some of the promising startups here in the region that your venture capital branch is looking into at present?</h4><p>Arzan VC is working on identifying and building a strong entrepreneurial ecosystem in the MENA region. Entrepreneurs in this region are in need of major financial and technical support, hence Arzan VC built its strategy and team to suit the market requirements. In the future, Arzan VC is expected to support entrepreneurs throughout MENA who are looking for early-stage funding. Kuwait is behind neighbor countries in supporting the creation of an entrepreneurial ecosystem. The government has established a fund of USD6 billion to support new business however, their vision and execution plan is still not clear. Arzan VC reviewed around 300 opportunities last year alone and managed to invest in 14 transactions. We continuously are looking for new investments and our target is to have a great investment every month.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead regarding your company's operations as well as the financial services management industry?</h4><p>We are intertwined with the Kuwaiti and global economies and things remain uncertain. Based on the outcome of US elections we have to reassess our investments there. At the same time, it will take us at least two to three years to determine the exact effect of the Brexit on our assets. Overall, we are currently facing a wealth of troubles but the way we advise our clients is that investment cannot be timed. That is what everybody should know. The best way to move forward is to diversify, to assess the risk, and mitigate it as much as you can. Nowadays, prudent and conservative investors, such as ourselves, have to accept a lower return, but at the same time there will be a better chance of preserving capital and net worth. However, I know that this approach will pay off in the future and hate to see an investor of mine lose money. The UK currency has depreciated about 10% but with us that has been offset with the other investments that we have outside of the UK. My advice to clients is that they have to accept a lower return on investments. This is how we deal with our clients and how we advise them locally and internationally.</p><h4>What do you consider to be the most important change your company will implement in the medium term?</h4><p>We will continue with our three-year strategy (2015-2017) implementation. We at Arzan continuously review our strategy, we watch and assist the markets we do business with and have exposers. In this same way always look for new opportunities, new markets, and new clients' needs and assess them to make sure that they are within our strategy and our risk appetite. Arzan is a very dynamic financial institution, and we do our best to satisfy our valuable clients with innovative products and excellent results.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your assessment of the agricultural sector's performance in 2015?</h4><p>Last year was a challenging year for everybody, not just in our sector but for all industries. The most positive development for our sector was entering new markets for some of our products. We now have new dealings in the US, various countries in Asia, and more in Central and South America. We are going to export growing quantities of fruit and have also established a joint venture between the private and public sectors to better promote and support foreign market openings. We have been working together with the Peruvian ministries of Foreign Trade and Agriculture, and the National Service of Agrarian Health. We are always planning ahead. </p><h4>What is the role of AGAP and how does it create synergies between the private and public sectors?</h4><p>AGAP was formed by seven associations and 400 companies representing different fresh products, ranging from vegetables, such as asparagus, to citrus fruit, table grapes, mangoes, blueberries, avocados, and pomegranates. We also help companies navigate legal issues. Since new projects take at least 10 years to recoup their investment and pay back banks and shareholders, we help explain to our legislators the need to extend and possibly make permanent a law that provides for the payment of all social and labor benefits and recognizes the seasonality of agrarian activities. AGAP also presents the government with the results of our independent studies, demonstrating not only economic but also the social advances that have been made, such as the increase in formal labor, rural development, the reduction of poverty, and the empowerment of women through agricultural production</p><h4>How is JJC Agrí­cola setting standards for the broader industry?</h4><p>Productivity combined with quality is the recipe for our success: producing 20 tons per hectare is twice as good as producing 10. In terms of exports, our main products are table grapes and asparagus; in these we are the largest in the world. China, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and other countries in Southeast Asia are very interesting markets for Peruvian exports.</p><h4>How will the sector capitalize on the recently established FTA between China and Peru?</h4><p>China is the biggest market and we are already involved there. The FTA helped us to develop our table grape exports to China, particularly the Red Globe grapes, and in August 2015 we started exporting Hass avocados there. Last year we opened the market for oversized mangos in the US. The first challenge in expanding is always phytosanitary regulations, which in some cases take between seven and 12 years to deal with. When we are in close collaboration with the public sector, this can be reduced to two or three years. We are also now concentrating on the Middle East, which is an excellent market, but presents some logistical and infrastructural issues to be dealt with. </p><h4>Europe and the US are sophisticated markets. How is the “Made In Peru" label perceived in those places?</h4><p>Entering these markets has pushed us to meet the highest international quality standards and to obtain the various required certifications, making good use of our corresponding investments in our farms and passing various audits and tests. However, this can cost between USD50,000-80,000, a burden for small producers that may not have the necessary infrastructure in place. Small producers need to obtain government assistance and technical training for these audits, which we are also advocating for.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>Our main target is to maintain growth in Peru. Over the past 10 years, we have had average growth of over 20% per year. In the past year alone, which was a challenging one, we grew by 13%, which is still good. Our other goal is to boost and formalize the agricultural industry in general, which is the second strongest domestic industry after mining. Companies in AGAP provide nearly 300,000 formal jobs, and we want to continue to register as many as possible. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Diversify or Perish]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[diversify-or-perish]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did Inversiones Centenario perform in 2015?</h4><p>Overall, 2015 was a great year. Centenario's profits grew by 88%, while our revenue grew 2%. All of our business units showed positive results in this challenging year. These results were the product of a great performance by the real estate business as well as the sale of shares in a subsidiary outside the real estate business. Our strategy has two angles: diversification of our real estate business, and striking a balance between sales and rental and geographic diversification. This strategy has allowed us to achieve great results and face the slowdown of the sector with more composure than our competitors.</p><h4>Which sectors have additional potential for strong growth in 2016?</h4><p>Our portfolio manages different segments such as land development, industrial development, office buildings, and shopping malls, and we recently entered the hospitality business with hotels. We have an investment budget of USD100 million for 2016, and investment is diversified in these business units. We have a lack of real estate infrastructure in both Lima and the provinces; we need more shopping malls, office buildings, and housing, so the opportunities are there.</p><h4>What are Centenario's activities in the industrial parks and industrial centers sector?</h4><p>Up until a few years ago, due to the lack of urban planning in Lima, industrial zones were in the middle of residential areas. Today, there are new areas specifically reserved for industrial purposes. Our project in the south of Lima called Macropolis in the Lurin district will become one of the most important industrial areas in Lima. We have 900ha in that zone and are developing a new industrial park. We already have the zoning and are starting construction in the coming months.</p><h4>What are some of the areas where Centenario is innovating and pushing things forward right now?</h4><p>The real estate sector is not as innovative as other sectors, but we try to bring some architectural improvements to the country. Currently, we are building a new office that was designed by well-known architect Jaan Novel and will innovate aesthetically and architecturally. We are also in the process of certifying our office buildings as sustainable and will do similarly with other projects in the future.</p><h4>What are some of the greatest challenges facing the company currently?</h4><p>One of the most interesting challenges in the coming months will be our entry into the hospitality industry, especially by taking advantage of our real estate know-how to monetize our land bank. In the first stage we will invest USD40 million to develop two projects, one in Lima and the other in Piura. We have been in the office building and land development sector for many years, and shopping malls are a recent investment. Hotels will be our new challenge in the short run.</p><h4>What does Centenario do to ensure it remains an attractive destination for talented workers?</h4><p>Our business culture is great at attracting and retaining talent. One of the best practices is to place a large emphasis on evaluating employee satisfaction. And it has worked: our group has been one of the best companies to work for in Peru for four years now.</p><h4>What are your main goals and objectives for 2016 and the future? What do you want to accomplish?</h4><p>Our goal is to be the most profitable real estate company in the country with the most diversified portfolio. Growth by diversification makes full sense because businesses are not that big in our countries to be “pure players" in only one segment. If we want to grow in the future we need to grab the opportunities in each segment of the market, which we have been doing recently with shopping malls and now with hotels. We will try to grab opportunities in the industrial field as well. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the latest trends characterizing the construction sector in Peru?</h4><p>In general, opening Peru's economy to privately financed concessions has been instrumental to the country's growth. The maturation of an infrastructure project—especially for concessions—has to be analyzed with a medium-term perspective. The infrastructure deficit is high and both the state and private sector are making serious efforts to meet the demand. The housing segment is more sensitive, however, and much depends on volatile factors such as access to credit, as banks may change their policies. For example, the housing deficit in Peru comes from the lower social class, despite the promotion funds such as MIVIVIENDA, which in practice favors the middle class. This fund has to be reformulated to benefit Peru's broader housing needs. The country is only building 40,000-60,000 homes a year, and compared to the rate of building in Chile or Colombia, we should be building over 120,000. It is a clear change of policies is necessary to boost this segment. </p><h4>How would you describe the quality of the existing infrastructure realized so far in Peru?</h4><p>Structural engineering is required to comply with international quality standards—it is not possible to build structures at a lower standard, especially in a seismic country like Peru, where all structures must be earthquake-resistant. National and private companies in Peru comply with the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standards and regulations, and all contracts are required to comply with Peruvian construction standards, which are based on international ones. We have always handled projects at the highest standard, not just in terms of quality of the products but in the operations of the company, attention to environmental regulations, and also to ISO regulations. The company has made a USD5 million investment over recent years toward technology. </p><h4>What have been the most iconic projects executed by OBRAINSA?</h4><p>In the last 10 years, the company has had a great leadership, working wherever the demand for infrastructure was greatest, particularly with roads—we have built over 5,000km of new asphalt roads. This country has three disparate regions, especially in the mountains and jungles, so we created a program called “Proyecto Peru" for the basic paving of roads. There are two main ways Peru's road issues need to be resolved. National roads involve an investment of nearly USD2 million per km, which is a large investment because of the challenging geographical features of Peru, and these last more than 20 years. Peru also has over 75,000km of secondary roads that need to be improved with basic asphalt and maintenance every five years. We have worked in Panamericana Sur in three different contracts and completed almost 3km of missing road between Arequipa and Ilo (Moquegua) that traverses the mountains, and took years to be completed. We have a presence in all of Peru's regions. We are currently working on a road in the north of Peru near the Condor Mountain range border with Ecuador. In infrastructure, we worked on the Pillones Dam in Arequipa, which we designed and built and it is one of the most important dams made in the recent years. The dam helped increase the energy production of the hydroelectric plant Charcani V, and supplied Cerro Verde with more water for its production. In the last three years, the company has decided to diversify its activity in all the areas of construction, focusing on infrastructure, construction, and various civil works. All three business units were successful over 2015, and we expect stability for this year and even for 2017. We are the builders and dealers for the concession of the Miraflores underground parking structure, we started the construction of a building for SUNAT, we are working on construction for Cayetano Heredia University and are building hospitals in Cajamarca and Huanuco. We are also working on an aqueduct in Ilo (Moquegua) that is part of an irrigation project and are building a 70km aqueduct between the highest point in Moquegua and the coast. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did the real estate and construction sector perform in Peru in 2015?</h4><p>Construction went down by 6% in 2015, whereas in other years it has generally gone up by more than Peruvian GDP. The reason is mainly due to some structural problems in the sector. Some infrastructure and housing projects were delayed due to regional and municipality elections at the end of 2014. The old system for issuing permits was slow and no longer met current demands. There were bottlenecks with the approval process. The commission that checked the blueprints for housing projects only worked for two hours a week, and the number of housing units on offer went down significantly in 2015. In 2014, we had roughly 29,000 units on offer in Lima, and this dropped to 23,000 units in 2015. That brought the market down. Another problem was due to the government change between 2014 and 2015 and delays with zoning in urban center around the country. This stopped the development of many new projects. In 2015, the housing and construction market fell mostly because of internal problems rather than low demand; demand is strong. There were 40,000 units available nationwide and the demand is for 1.8 million units. Over the next 20 years, we will need 2 million additional housing units, which creates great potential. We need to construct between 140,000 and 150,000 units of housing per year for the next 20 years to make up for the current deficit. There is currently at least a USD60 billion infrastructure gap in the construction sector. If we continued at the same slow pace of 2015, the gap would be USD160 billion over the next 20 years. New governments will to have to tackle this gap to provide the roads, ports, airports, schools, and hospitals that Peru needs. The infrastructure market is, therefore, strong, and we seek investment opportunities. The government has opened up the area of infrastructure development to PPPs and concessions, which is great. This allows investors to make long-term investments in this sector.</p><h4>What action is CAPECO taking to facilitate new investment and increase connections between possible investors and firms in the sector?<br></h4><p>CAPECO is a non-profit association for companies such as suppliers; infrastructure developers, constructors, and general contractors; and housing real estate developers. CAPECO's administrative functions fall under three areas. The first is to work with local, regional, and national governments to influence their policies and agendas that impact the sector in the short, medium, or long term. We work to make a clear and dynamic agenda that allows for communication and the revitalization of the development of the sector. Education is the second function of CAPECO's central administration. Due to the rapid growth of the economy the demand for specialized workers for certain parts of the economy has increased exponentially. We, therefore, have an institute that provides training, mostly in the construction industry. We have committed to extending our education network into different regions to try to fill those skill gaps. The third area we work in is various chamber activities, such as business networking, road shows, national and international missions, and trade shows. </p><h4>What are CAPECO's goals for 2016 and the medium term?</h4><p>We need to finalize our permanent planning committees with the government in 2016. We are also working on our Better Cities Project. Under this project, we provide technical support to the Arequipa regional government and to the Cusco municipal government to work on various city expansion plans. The aim is to have more ordered urban development and predictability in terms of the next steps. We are primarily dedicated to working with the new government on the infrastructure plan as well as housing planning, which we call city planning, for Peru's 235 main cities over the next five years. We have a long and ambitious agenda of things to do, including the expansion of our education system to other cities in the country. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What opportunities exist within the private aviation sector in Peru?</h4><p>Aviation is a promising sector. We have been working for the last two years in the corporate VIP segment of this sector, which until recently was completely unattended. We have been working closely with five-star hotels and travel agencies to offer packages. We are the only company in Peru with two jets. Our increasing efforts in the last couple of years have earned us a prominent position in the region; we received the Best Private Jet in the Region award from the World Travel Awards in recognition of our efforts, investment, and perseverance in the segment. We have also made significant efforts in the local market here in Peru, where, unfortunately, there is not a widespread culture of private charters. This is due to the austerity years the country went through. However, we have put together a convincing campaign to make potential clients realize that their time is valuable, and that by hiring an aircraft they can avoid losing days to traveling. </p><h4>How would you assess the level of competition in the sector?</h4><p>Currently, companies operating in the charter segment are rather small and tend to focus on the jungle areas. Our main competitors are regular airlines that allocate an airplane or two to cover the charter demand there is at the corporate level. This makes us rather unique in the industry. Having said that, one of our competitive advantages is on-time flights and arrivals, since we do not depend on other regular flights to free our jets. We have three PA-42 planes and we are currently considering replacing them; we want to purchase two BE-1900, a jet can that easily land in geographically difficult lanes. </p><h4>How much are you investing in the maintenance of your fleet and what is the importance of the highly qualified team working in this business? €¨</h4><p>We have commercial partnerships with leading companies and in the event we need technical support, this is provided to us in the shortest time possible. This technical support can even include the entire change of engine of the aircraft and covers our entire fleet. We also invest in technicians, who mostly come from the Peruvian Armed Forces. This is the main source of a technically skilled and capable workforce. In this context, we also have a partnership in place to train our mechanics. We do not consider this an expenditure, but an investment. Comprehensive training is also provided to pilots. We believe security and quality are two of our main competitive advantages. In terms of security, we hold certificates from the Fly Safety Foundation, which brings high levels of reputation and reliability. These are ongoing efforts to continuously improve security standards and levels. As per quality, we have certified our processes with the ISO 9001. These achievements have taken place mostly in the last couple of years. We believe this is what will make us successful and reliable—customers look for quality in service and security. </p><h4>What is the average profile of your customers and what are the most common destinations you cover with your flights?</h4><p>We focus on the corporate segment, which is comprised largely of oil and mining companies. In the last two years, this has changed due to the challenging situation in these sectors, which has encouraged us to look for new business lines and opportunities. At the moment, we strongly focus on air ambulance services for our clients and for the general public through insurance companies. We are currently the only company offering such integral services. We have our own medical staff and equipment. In Peru, there are companies that have the medical equipment and staff, but they do not have the aircraft to offer the service. In regards to the destinations, we fly regularly to Piura, Cusco, Arequipa, Trujillo, Pisco, and many other locations in Peru. In the region we occasionally fly to Bogotá, Rio de Janeiro, Quito, Panama, and to farther destinations like New York and Madrid. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Beefing up  the Ports]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[beefing-up-the-ports]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the role of Peruvian ports in the country's economic development?</h4><p>The economic development of a country is based on a logistics chain that integrates its production, transport, and distribution systems. From this perspective, ports are an important part in the development of international commerce. Since nearly 90% of our exports and imports pass through them, the APN has been an important step in the promotion and development of the country's ports. There are currently 81 port installments in the country, including maritime, river, and lake systems. Of these, 26 installments are for public usage and 55 for private. And the state only plays a normative and supervisory role, leaving the management of these terminals to the private sector.</p><h4>What innovations or developments are being introduced into the port system in Peru?</h4><p>As a public-private initiative, the Peruvian state has carried out a series of port concessions, a process that began in 1999 with the Matarani Port Terminal and followed, in 2006, with the concession of the New Container Terminal-South Pier of Callao Port. These were followed by the Paita Port Terminal in 2009 and the Multipurpose North and Loading Minerals terminals at the Callao Port in 2011. These modernizations have brought much greater efficiency and widened our international commerce, reduced operation times, and improved flows in the logistical chain. Altogether, these concessions generated infrastructural investments in the ports of nearly USD1.4 billion for public use and USD700 million for private use.</p><h4>How could the expansion of the Panama Canal affect Peru?</h4><p>Given its strategic position, the expansion of the Panama Canal will grant Peru opportunities in the growth of international commerce by permitting the entry of larger ships. The Peruvian state is already preparing for this new scenario by giving priority to the development of port infrastructure and ensuring that land routes improve connectivity in the logistical chain at the national level. This development is in addition to the implementation of the state's productive diversification plan, designed to generate increased economic growth in the country.</p><h4>What steps is APN taking to increase port security and prevent drug trafficking?</h4><p>A very important subject for APN is port security. As the modernization of the ports advances, the increase of illegal stock transfers is worrying. To combat this, the Peruvian government has allocated a large amount of funds, especially in the fight against the illicit trafficking of drugs (TID). It is also fighting to lower coca leaf cultivation, reduce merchandise transfer routes, and strengthen control levels in the port installations by continuously improving the international ship and port facility. As part of this effort, in 2015 the APN and the Anti-Drugs Directorate (DIRANDRO) of the Peruvian National Police (PNP) signed agreements in order to combat activities related to TID and organized crime at the port installations. As a result of these agreements, we formed the Port Intelligence Committee to prevent illegal port-related activity, and invited DIRANDRO personnel to help monitor the Callao port. APN has also forged an agreement with SUNAT to carry out joint underwater inspections of ships in the Callao port. With the support of APN boats, SUNAT divers will verify that the ships' hulls do not contain TID.</p><h4>What are your main objectives for 2016?</h4><p>The work of the APN is to ensure that port infrastructure guarantees an efficient merchandise trade, which we are achieving. Various projects are on target. In coordination with the MCT and Proinversión, we are evaluating private initiatives of the Salaverry, Chimbote, and Ilo port terminals in order to develop them for public use. Our next target is to consolidate the participation of ports as an essential node in the logistical chain. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[coming-up-next]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the challenges SAS faces in expanding throughout the country?</h4><p>We particularly face challenges in respect of two important issues. The first challenge is the need to evangelize with regard to the benefits of business analytics, and the second challenge is the market itself. Business analytics is a totally different segment from business intelligence, which all companies are doing. Our core is analytics, which involves taking different data and sources and analyzing them in order to plan and optimize businesses' operations. It is about coming out with a different point of view concerning the data and how it is used. Our challenges are, therefore, to champion the value of this process and to make SAS a specialist service provider for certain sectors. I want SAS to be the number-one company that business executives in the banking, telecommunications, retail, and industry sectors come to when they want to resolve a problem. This is what we will work toward over the next four years.</p><h4>What is the importance of the Peruvian market for SAS in the region?</h4><p>In our South Latin American region, Peru is the most important market right now because it is stable and larger than the Ecuadorian, Chilean, and Colombian markets. The business analytics market here is in touch with businesses, and we, therefore, have good opportunities with the companies. Peru will represent 20% of the region's total sales in 2016. My plan is that by 2020 Peru will be ranked number one in Latin America for SAS.</p><h4>Are there other industries where SAS could help to succeed and advance in Peru?</h4><p>Retail is another potentially important area. The plan for the mining industry is simple, but we have an important focus on results. Mining companies in Peru have a high level of operational technology; however, their IT capabilities are not well developed. Our plan is to increase their performance in the IT area, including the software that they use to analyze their data in real time, which other industries are already using. This will help the mining industry reduce its costs. We look at solutions tailored to the specific issues that the mining industry is currently facing. The situation is a bit different for the retail industry, which is huge in Peru. We have many Chilean and local companies in Peru that all face substantial competition. However, none of them have much customer data. We undertake many projects in the retail sector to provide companies with customer analysis so that they can offer specific deals to their customers one-on-one. We also work with them on pricing and discounting issues. We are developing a strong, in-depth analysis for the retail market in Peru that falls into the two categories of customer intelligence and pricing analysis.</p><h4>What will be the most important topics and trends for SAS in 2017 and beyond?</h4><p>We have a specific plan for next year. We aim to develop a plan in banking, which means that we will have a new solution for the banking sector. It is a specific and solid solution in the area of risk. Our goal is to increase our pipeline and opportunities in banking so that we can position and implement these kinds of solutions. The other part of our plan relates to the mining industry. We want to be involved in this sector and want to position some relevant products in the market. These products are designed to assist the mining industry in reducing its costs and optimizing processes, which is a new area for us where we want to push our services. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[getting-all-the-way]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why is Peru characterized by lower telecoms penetration rates compared to its regional neighbors?</h4><p>Peru has a complex geography. The main problem is that the population is concentrated on the shore, with the highlands and jungles less populated and less attended to in terms of services and infrastructure. With one-third of the population in Lima and 60-70% of the GDP coming from the shoreline areas, there is a huge discrepancy in coverage and development across the country, which is not a favorable structure in terms of growing and increasing services, at least not through an open market. That is why FITEL's projects are crucial. The state has to bring the infrastructure to those areas and reduce the gaps in the country so that companies can serve greater parts of the population and other areas of the country. There are up to 1.5 million people who receive no telecoms coverage at all. The situation is better than it was before, of course, but it is still underdeveloped. The next step, once the infrastructure is in place, is to meet demand, educate students and the population, and deliver the necessary telecoms services to them. In the four regions where we are active, we will provide around 450,000 tablets. The next step is services, including education about the internet, data, remote education, e-health, and e-government services that will improve the quality of life of the population and give them a reason and desire to use the internet. FITEL's first goal 16-17 years ago was to reduce the distance a villager walks to a phone from 50km to an average 5km, so we installed many public phones around the country. After all, most villagers have a relative who has left for the city. Everyone has someone outside the village, and everyone has someone to call and talk to. As with phone usage, they now also have the money to use the internet, the means, the technology, and the reason to use it. We want to do the same with internet access for the average Peruvian that we did with phones.</p><h4>How much do you invest in R&amp;D to maintain your competitive edge?</h4><p>We are the most advanced in satellite communications technology-wise. We have the most advanced R&amp;D in the market with the fastest return channels to reach higher speeds everywhere, a big advantage, especially with the new generation of satellites with higher capacity. Our terminals bring more capacity everywhere in the world. We are also at the forefront in terms of mobility. We have special antennas and equipment that provide communication from moving platforms like planes and ships. In Peru, our knowledge is more on the operative level. There are many regulatory aspects. In order to incentivize growth in rural areas, knowing the right way to implement universal service programs throughout the country, the laws required to be successful in that country, the right market conditions, regulations, and tariffs are all crucial, and we have that knowledge base, and the government works closely with us to provide the right conditions to achieve these long-term strategic goals that it has set for the country. Everything we do ultimately has a social impact by improving communication and connectivity. We offer more than just economics; it is also a social and human service. That also naturally translates into economic development. We also have a great operation in Colombia and are considering advancing and expanding into other areas. We have networks deployed in more than 90 countries worldwide, so growth is a natural part of our corporate agenda. We look at which countries and regions are ready for what we provide. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the efficiency of the telecommunication sector here in Peru?</h4><p>The evolution of this sector has to be evaluated in the context of the Peruvian economy, which has been growing at rates of about 7% a year for the last six years. During the last few years, this has been reduced to more or less 3%. In this context, the telecoms and ICT sector has continued with rapid growth. In terms of investments, penetration, or numbers of lines for example, all the numbers in this sector have grown. Particularly in the case of investments, in the last two or three years, this sector has received a historical record in terms of investments. This shows that the dynamics of this sector are independent of the dynamics of the more traditional sectors that are the engine of the economy, such as mining and raw materials. ICT has become an important tool in many other sectors. The most important driver of the ICT sector in Peru, and other countries, is innovation. The growth is in sectors that were not, until now, using ICT that intensively. ICT is increasing competitiveness in many sectors—services, manufacturing, and so on. There is a close relationship between the growth of this sector and efficiency.</p><h4>What role does the private sector play in increasing coverage in Peru?</h4><p>Far more operators in the telecoms sector are private in Peru compared to other countries. We have no public or government operators in Peru. We have recognized the importance of private-sector participation in operation and investment. But, also, the government has recognized the importance of intervening in sectors where we have bottlenecks, such as in transport infrastructure. One of the most frustrating bottlenecks facing the telecoms sector is the low availability of transport infrastructure and fiber-optic infrastructure networks. In these cases, government intervention is important, but that concerns the funding stage, not the operational stage. There is a recognition that any project we want to develop and deploy in the sector has to be made in partnership with private companies, from the operation to the delivery to the users. The government's role is to participate in such sectors where we can clearly identify a lack of funding or profitability. In these cases, the government should participate in funding, but always invite private companies to participate in the operation, as is the case for the fiber optic backbone.</p><h4>How do you compare Peru to other countries in the region in terms of ICT capabilities?</h4><p>The evolution of the ICT segment in Peru follows the general trend in the region. However, the performance in the Peruvian market cannot be compared to the performance of Uruguay or Chile. The geography and distribution of the population and space throughout the territories of the countries are different. Geography can make achieving high rates of penetration or more coverage around the territory of the country more expensive. These two key factors explain why, in Peru, despite having higher rates of investment per capita in the telecoms sector than other countries, we do not yet have similar penetration rates or density rates in fixed internet or telephony. Fixed networks are more expensive in Peru, which is why Peru's strategy is to invest in wired networks. </p><h4>What are your goals and expectations for 2016?</h4><p>In the last three years, we have instituted many reforms. We have reformed the quality of regulation, claims, attention, and coverage. Now our challenge is to make sure that these rules are enforced adequately and efficiently, and to develop the management tools so that the supervision and enforcement of these rules can be done efficiently. We have not announced new rules except for net neutrality, but we have to continue the strengthening process of our supervision and enforcement systems in order to be more efficient and to improve our performance as supervisors of the rules that we ourselves have approved. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the current status of connectivity and IT infrastructure in Peru?</h4><p>All large-scale projects as IT infrastructure across the country require estate policies to back them up. In 2008, we saw many state policies come to a halt and that had an impact on universities and other such centers. I have been an active promoter at all levels of implementation of fiber optics in the country for a long time. It has been a long and slow process that started when we implemented the much-needed broadband regulation in the sector, which gave the country and FITEL the necessary legal framework for the implementation of this and other projects. FITEL has played an active role in the development and implementation of the main regulatory framework in the sector as well as its key projects.</p><h4>What have been the landmark achievements in the sector since the implementation of the backbone fiber optic network?</h4><p>We built a 13,500km national fiber optic network, which feeds as many as 180 capital cities throughout the provinces. This network was developed alongside Peru's logistics corridor. We hired external consultants to analyze the backbone network and corridor that we developed. Among the main benefits of this network are the development of capillaries, the provision of high-quality cable TV services to Peruvians, the capabilities of the network in its own right, and boosting the IT sector. We have seen many positive developments in e-health in the remote regions of Peru, which has saved time and money for many rural Peruvians. We are also part of a national committee to develop and implement the guidelines for the development of Peru's e-health sector.</p><h4>What are some of the main challenges the sector faces?</h4><p>There is a lack of trust by the national authorities in IT specialists. We are creative and innovative, but the public authorities prefer foreign expertise when it comes to innovation, despite us having proven our value. The national backbone fiber-optic network is a local project and we tested a small-scale project in Silicon Valley with Cisco. However, having said that, we also face a challenge in terms of human resources; we do not have enough qualified telecommunications engineers.</p><h4>In 2013 only 10% of rural inhabitants were connected to the internet. How do you promote and ensure homogeneous national coverage across the country?</h4><p>We have always aimed to provide the network with high levels of capillarity and in this context there are as many as 21 regional projects linked to the main network. Four of these projects are already under way, and nine projects were approved in 2016. The remaining ones will hopefully be implemented during the next government. We believe that e-health developments should be mirrored in education, security, production, and other key sectors. This also means training our companies in content. We have foreseen the construction of a demand aggregation center, which should help to boost pilot and test projects.</p><h4>What are your main priorities?</h4><p>The first priority is an online state television network that will be made available to the entire country, showing all open channels and university channels as well as other public channels. Another project has to do with the development of an emergency network to better understand the needs of our people in case of severe climate conditions such as tropical storms or hurricanes. In this context, we want to centralize all emergency services through a single telephone number. Overall, regional projects linked to the national network are key for 2016, and the government has allocated as much as PEN440 million (USD128.3 million) as part of the budget for the Ministry of Transport and Communications for the implementation of these projects. Another goal is for Peru to have its own communications satellite in the near future. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess Adnip's performance over the past year and what were the company's major accomplishments?</h4><p>We have experienced strong growth across all of our business lines over the past year. Our paper production line increased turnover from 65,000 to 95,000 tons in a 12-month period, and we were fully booked with no spare quantity left to sell. The new machine produces Advanced NTT paper, a higher absorbance, softer, and bulkier paper with very unique qualities that is only produced in Mexico, Chile, and the UAE. This new product opened the doors to the European market for us. Different multinationals have approached us to carry the commercialization of NTT paper. On the other hand, our carpet business also increased and we went from selling 200 million to 270 million per year. We improved the efficiency of the machines to produce larger quantities with less material wastage. Our medical devices segment also performed well in the production of auto-disable syringes used for vaccination, where we remain the major supplier for UNICEF and for the Pan American Health Organization.</p><h4>Your paper business experienced a 30% production increase in only one year. What factors prompted such growth?</h4><p>We have a long-standing reputation for being top-quality service providers. We are considered the best supplier in the MENA region and our client base comprises of people inclined to prioritize quality over price. For instance, we guarantee our customers that our paper will help them improve their production capacity and efficiency as its resilient and durable. Everyone values being quality orientated, from the chairman to every worker in our company, which helps us be an efficiency-conscious producer. If demand keeps rising as it has been until now, I will consider introducing a fourth machine to meet the market demand. On top of that, our new NTT technique is inherently eco-friendly since it absorbs much better and its more efficient when it comes to its utilization. Our plant is also equipped with a de-inking plant where we re-pulp our waste so we can reuse it and decrease the levels of waste to almost zero. Bearing in mind that an increasing number of clients opt to purchase environmentally- friendly products, our paper has become the preferred choice.</p><h4>Your expansion process has also encountered some problems related to competition from mass-production companies. How has Adnip turned the tables against these competitors?</h4><p>Mass production centers such as China, Turkey, or India represent our fiercest competition because they sell at lower prices and apply dumping practices when introducing their products into tertiary markets. However, our strength is in the quality rather than the quantity and we maintain a strong client base with companies that are conscious about quality and conform to tight schedules. Mass production competitors find it more difficult to comply with timings and deliveries and that is where they lose out in comparison to Adnip. We also cover the more protected markets, such as Saudi Arabia, where mass production companies have difficulties entering due to high taxes and strict requirements.</p><h4>Which markets represent the bulk of your operations for the paper production line?</h4><p>Our main market is Saudi Arabia, where we export around 40% of our production. In recent years they shifted from what we used to call 100% recycled paper or super commercial paper, which was 70% recycled-30% prime pulp, into prime quality paper, which is far more expensive due to its purity. This was to our benefit since we were producing this type of paper and introduced it into the Saudi market. We have a product line called Velvet, a high-quality prime paper that has become the beacon of our market sales in Saudi and the UAE. Other than that, we are also exporting to Europe where the biggest tissue companies such as Kimberly Clark are coming to the UAE and shipping our products to their markets. To the UK alone we ship 500 tons of paper every month. The UAE still represents one of our most significant markets since quality is the top priority here and this is our identity card.</p><h4>The healthcare sector in the UAE is projected to become a USD20 billion industry by 2020. How will Adnip capitalize on this opportunity?</h4><p>Our medical devices lines went through a long periods of stagnation before taking off. Until recently, we used to depend heavily on our global partners such as UNICEF to support the line, because there are many requirements, qualifications, and red tape to overcome before fully commercializing these types of products. We recently won the tender from the Ministry of Health and we are now working closely with the Union Defense Force, the armed forces of the UAE, and all of the medical entities in the country to supply them with our medical devices. Before the tender, we were known by just a few hospitals that have now spread the word about our products. My expectation is that within a year we will expand our plant to meet higher consumption needs and our products will compete head to head with the American and European brands established here. Our next step is to be qualified at a GCC level by the different entities in the region and start to get involved in tenders at a GCC level in 2017, which will enable us to double our capacity. The next step will be to enter new segments such as gloves, masks, gowns, and a wider variety of medical products to enhance our portfolio at a regional level.</p><h4>Which markets have been more receptive to your reusable medical devices?</h4><p>Around 90% of our medical devices are shipped outside of the UAE, mainly to Africa, Latin America, and the Arab world. We currently ship around 400 million syringes annually. Also, our partnership with UNICEF opens the door to countries where they have a strong presence through their programs from India to Lebanon to Southeast Asia. The wonderful thing about our auto-disable product is that people are avoiding diseases and further complications since they can only be used once, limiting the risk of cross-contamination, which is important for developing countries where there is little knowledge about the risks of re-utilizing syringes and this is where it is more marketable.</p><h4>What strategy did you apply to grow your carpet production lines to match the success of your other two business segments?</h4><p>Much in the way we did with our paper production segment, we focused on high quality and product diversification. By introducing new machinery for higher-quality products we also increased our profitability and today we are the only company in the UAE that produces Axminster carpets, which are mostly sold to hotels. With huge events taking place in the region in the upcoming years, from the Dubai Fair in 2020 or the World Cup in Qatar in 2022, we made the carpet business grow to cater for the booming hospitality sector these events create.</p><h4>What do you see for the future of the company in the next three years?</h4><p>The company is currently worth AED800 million and within two years we intend to become AED2 billion worth. The immediate plans for 2017 is to do mergers and acquire new business lines that will awake the interest of other companies. We are looking to diversify our scope to cover other industries such as aluminum, steel, carpentry, and the like. There is a great future in these areas and despite the current economic adversities I foresee great performance for Adnip in 2017.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the evolution of the mining sector in Peru over the last few years, and how has it impacted your operations?</h4><p>As commodity prices have gone down, smaller mines have had to shut down or limit their production. There have also been fewer large-scale investments in the sector. Copper prices were the last to slow down. The smaller mines have generally opted to cut costs by choosing cheaper products, which are also less reliable, of our competitors, but the larger mining houses like Southern, Freeport, Barrick, Glencore, BHP, and Newmont all stay with traditional suppliers like us because they do bulk mining and are large operations. The cost for them to stop is tremendous so they stay close to the OEMs. The landscape has changed. When Atlas Copco Peruana started, we were selling some pneumatic handheld equipment and some basic compressors.  Now, we are partners with our clients, and we do not just sell them equipment; we sell them services and solutions. </p><h4>How has the competition in this market evolved over the years?</h4><p>In surface mining, we compete with Caterpillar, while in underground mining we compete with Caterpillar and Sandvik. Over the last 15 to 20 years, there has also been an increase in Korean and Chinese companies entering the market and these companies have been able to replicate existing technologies at a much lower cost but not at the same quality versus value levels. Besides that, there are also some local producers whom we compete with in Peru, since Peru is a mature mining market. </p><h4>What role does innovation and technology transfer play in Atlas Copco's operations in Peru?</h4><p>We have always looked at how we can use technology to make mining more efficient. We work to introduce new technologies and showcase what technology and innovation can mean to our clients' operations. This is more than just about providing equipment. We are helping shape a framework in which the technologies can be implemented and applied into their operations. Looking at Peru overall, the country utilizes traditional mining methods, and technological advances have been slow to catch on during the mining boom. The majority of advances have been mostly in surface mining, where the multinationals are the most active, as they have the operations of scale. This is also where a lot of the technology transfer happens. Typically in countries where labor costs are nominal, companies tend to not pay too much attention to automation, but we can show that it is not just a matter of the cost of implementing and operating it, and also training the people to use it; it is a matter of achieving consistency and repeatability in production.</p><h4>How does Atlas Copco find a synergy between economic growth and environmental stewardship? </h4><p>In terms of sustainability, we do remanufacturing, whereby we take components from old products and overhaul them to a like new state equivalent to new components. Hence, we can both save on scrapping and also sell our products at a lower cost to our customers. That also means we produce less waste, there are fewer wasted resources, and fewer emissions. </p><h4>What are your targets and expectations for 2016?</h4><p>In 2016, we do not expect any uptakes in investment capital. In the medium term, we expect growth. As commodities have been depressed and supplies have gone down, the demand will eventually outstrip it, so it is just a matter of when it will happen. Over 10 years we expect 7-10% growth. To this end, we are making the necessary investment, investing in training, in our consumable business, and in service support. Consumables and service support will be the two bookends for us in 2016. We will continue to focus on technology, bringing in machines that are brand new for this market. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the latest trends characterizing the energy sector in Peru?</h4><p>The energy sector here is in the middle of a cycle marked by an over-capacity problem. The reserve margin in 2016-2017 will exceed the 70% level, which is huge; therefore, we are observing a phase of low prices, and there is a struggle in the market to obtain contracts with regulated and unregulated clients. We expect this phase of the cycle will last for three or four more years. Then, when demand rises again and the reserve margin falls, prices will probably come back to more normal levels. What we are suffering now is essentially the result of government intervention over the last five or six years where the government promoted a great deal of additional capacity; however, this additional capacity was not supported by stronger demand. It was assumed that it would continue growing at 10% per year forever. What actually happened was a slowdown in demand and all of the additional capacity entering the market deepened the overcapacity problem. There are also many distortions in the market in terms of prices and subsidies, again mostly due to government intervention. The new administration will have to do a great deal of work to dismantle the distortions and recover the spirit of the 1992 and 2006 reforms. This means deregulating and promoting open and fair competition in the market with no distortions, no subsidies, and no special treatment of some technologies or for particular agents.</p><h4>How can Fenix Power Peru position itself as a provider of international standards and how will the company's acquisition by Colbún from Chile improve the operation?</h4><p>That is a key element in our mission. Colbún is a company with more than 30 years' experience in the Chilean market. Even though it is not the largest company in the power sector, (being third in terms of size), it is one of the most respected companies in Chile. Fenix Power is Colbún's first venture outside the Chilean market and is important for the Peruvian market. Colbún has come to stay for the long term and to grow. In this phase, it is obviously not logical to build greenfield projects in Peru; hence, using M&amp;As is more reasonable. Therefore, we are in the process of trying to buy more plants, both thermal and hydro. We want to obtain a balance between hydro and thermal in order to better pool our risks. Buying hydro is essentially a matter of balancing of risks, while buying more thermal assets is an issue of achieving economies of scale and synergies that reduce our costs and increase overall efficiency. This is an industry where economies of scale are important. To have Colbún as our parent company is important in terms of becoming an established, recognized, and respected player in the Peruvian market.</p><h4>What is the most ambitious change that you want to see as GM of Fenix Power Peru?</h4><p>The former owners of Fenix Power Peru decided that they wanted to sell the company over a year ago, and, of course, the attitude towards the market is totally different if there is an intent to sell. They were not aggressive and were not seeking out new contracts. When Colbún bought the company, it found there was a significant amount of energy that needed to be contracted in an aggressive market. We therefore try to shift the company's policies to become more aggressive in the market in order to sell our energy in the short, medium, and long term to non-regulated clients and regulated as well. We are participating in several bidding processes, which contrasts with the fact that the company was absent over the last year. We need to increase our portfolio of PPAs, which goes hand in hand with growing by acquiring new assets to take advantage of economies of scale and becoming a larger player. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the highlights of your 2015-2021 strategic plan?</h4><p>We want our services and activities to generate added value so that we can contribute more efficiently to the development of electric and mining sector in the country. We want to make sure that consumers receive quality services and that there is a logical price-quality relation. Peru should have strong wholesale and retail players as well as an efficient market. In the gas market, we want to formalize much of the activity that currently takes place across several segments of the sector. We also aim to make the use of natural gas universal in vehicles. Finally, in the mining sector, we want to reduce accident risks related to infrastructure to protect people and goods, as well as reduce fatality rates. In terms of tariff regulation, we want to strengthen people's trust in our regulatory processes and set up a political analysis of the impact our regulation has on the sector.</p><h4>How would you compare approaches to safety between local mining companies and their international counterparts?</h4><p>All the large and medium mining companies operating in the country comply with the safety regulations in place. This is an element that helps us strengthen trust in the eyes of foreign investors. We also need to mention the small and artisanal mining segments that work with much lower volumes. These work under regional mining regulation. In that segment, we cannot give many details because these operations are beyond the scope of our influence.</p><h4>What is your take on the Minister of Energy's aim to diversify the country's matrix by 2025 to reach 60% of total supply from renewable energy?</h4><p>The country has an energy matrix in which 50% of the current supply comes from hydro hydraulic energy, 47% from natural gas, and 3% from non-conventional renewable energies. Reaching 60% by 2025 is an achievable target. In the last decade, we have seen a transition and diversification of our energy matrix, in which gas has become more relevant and takes a more significant share, making the overall assessment more balanced.</p><h4>How will the Southern Gas Pipeline impact the sector's developments?</h4><p>The Southern Gas Pipeline is one of Peru's largest-ever energy projects. It will have a massive impact on the southern energy map of the country. The construction of two electric energy plants in this region of Peru is another element to take into consideration in terms of the energy development of the region, having an impact in both generation and consumption. These energy plants would increase the generating capacity by 1,000 MW. These developments will strengthen energy security at the national level.</p><h4>In terms of human resources, is the sector ready for the many energy projects scheduled for the next few years?</h4><p>The growth of the energy sector in the last few years, at an average rate of 7%, required many qualified people. One of Osinergmin's main roles is to play an active part in securing the needs of the sector from a human resources point of view. We train professionals through qualified trainings and courses and certify an average of 100 people every summer. These are mainly recently graduated students who after completing their studies take up our courses. We have also played a key role in training people from a regulatory point of view for the last 14 years.</p><h4>What are your main objectives for 2016?</h4><p>We want to decentralize some of our roles and services to strengthen our regional activity. By doing this, we will also make sure that the quality of the services in the regions reach the necessary standards. This especially affects the distribution segment. Also, we will be able to monitor and implement, if needed, more sanctions at the regional level. Second, we want to modernize and update some regulatory frameworks, especially concerning advertising. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What peculiarities characterize the environment in Peru?</h4><p>Every player in the Peruvian financial system uses a different terminology to refer to the concept of bonds, including international institutions. This can create confusion. Some of the bonds we deal with in Peru are considered “first demand," which makes the underwriting very important.</p><h4>Do you work alongside public authorities to implement clearer rules for the system?</h4><p>We have done a lot of work with the public administration in terms of credit insurance, which is a useful tool for governments to boost foreign trade. The sector has seen a lot of innovation in the last few years. We have an agreement with COFIDE within the Programa de Seguro de Credito a la Exportación (SEPYMEX) program, in place since 2002. We have an exclusive agreement by which 50% of every export of Peruvian SMEs is covered by Secrex, making us the leader in credit insurance products for exporting companies.</p><h4>What role does new technology play in the development of the company?</h4><p>This is a major part of our development and we have signed partnerships to leverage our capabilities in this field. New technologies have been key elements in our activity, especially in the bonds area where we have done a lot of work in automating underwriting. Custom agencies bonds are one such example. At the moment, around 60% of our performing bonds are within civil works and the remaining 40% are customs agencies and casinos. We have a strong focus on developing the latter two. We also harness our knowledge and 35 years of experience to help foreign companies, many from Spain, as they enter Latin America. This structure has slowed down the decision-making process, but strengthened our efficiency and global capabilities.</p><h4>What is the potential of Peruvian SMEs?</h4><p>The SEPYMEX program is the best example we can give, and the fact that the government wants to extend it is a clear statement of the role these businesses are set to play in the future of the Peruvian economy. We have seen SMEs reaching many new markets in the last few years, and this is thanks to the export capabilities of this country, regardless of its size. For example, agribusiness is one of the sectors with the greatest potential for the near future. SMEs have great potential for export activity due to the fact that Peruvian products are sold at higher prices in foreign markets.</p><h4>What other sectors will underpin Peru's future growth?</h4><p>Apart from agribusiness, the mining industry is set to play a key role in Peru's future development. Peru has large mineral resources and, though these are mainly non-insurable commodities, we see more sophisticated derivate products. We have one customer exporting to as many as 55 different countries.</p><h4>How do you see Secrex evolving in the near future?</h4><p>We would like to introduce certain products and programs we have in Spain. For example, for a while credit insurance was dying out in Spain due to extreme competition and players being extremely pushy. That changed with the construction bubble and the financial crisis that hit the country a few years ago. So we started offering other side services rather than bringing down prices, one of the main trends. This was also driven by the necessity to reduce the impact of the bad claims we had back then. In this context, we developed the “CESCE Master Oro" policy, introducing variable prices and breaking the prevailing paradigm in the industry. This has evolved into the “Pay-Per-Cover Policy" or the “Full Cover" we now have in place, where the customer decides what they want to insure. Overall, we offer a more personalized product in a more attractive platform on the internet, changing the way the sector operates. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the defining trends in the lending environment in Peru?</h4><p>What we have been seeing in the past couple of years are examples of larger companies acquiring smaller ones, leading to a more competitive industry. During these buyouts we are also seeing foreign companies trying to enter the Peruvian market, which means we are still a growing market without being a saturated one. As of now, we are the leader in the collateral loans industry, with a USD25 million portfolio. Last year alone, we expanded our business activity by 15%.</p><h4>What are your company's competitive advantages?</h4><p>We have been operating for 20 years and already have 84 offices across the country, the largest network of agencies in this industry in Peru. In the last few years, we focused on branch expansion in the provinces, where we have received a warm welcome and reached areas where our competitors are still absent. We have also strengthened our equity over the last few years and are at 42% of global capital, while the system only requires 10%. Our future plans include expanding our network to 150 agencies in the next five years and increasing our product portfolio.</p><h4>What segments offer the greatest growth potential?</h4><p>We currently accept jewelry, vehicles, and general items as collateral, but we plan on expanding our portfolio in 2016. We want to enter the consumer loans segment, especially for those in the USD150-500 range. Since we are focusing on low-range loans as an add-on tool for evaluation, we will use a quick psychometric evaluation on potential customers to better understand their payment behavior and willingness. We have also recently entered the retail segment with used goods stores. Our main goal is to be present in all commercial and non-commercial segments.</p><h4>What role does innovation play at Inversiones La Cruz?</h4><p>There are few financial institutions offering the types of microcredits that we do. By using psychometric evaluations, we understand their willingness to pay rather than just their payment capabilities, a tool being used with great success in Africa and Asia, especially in small loans.  We also began offering an online loan service course which allows customers to detail the amount of money they need using their basic information. If they qualify after a quick evaluation, we extend the loan. Finally, we have coverted some of our loan agencies into retail hybrids by becoming used—goods stores that double as loan agencies.</p><h4>What are your main areas of focus when communicating with customers?</h4><p>We utilize several channels. We had a strong focus last year on guerrilla marketing, meaning that we work a lot on the road promoting our products and making sure potential customers recognize our brand and what we do. This was a successful strategy, because people are often unaware of what we do and what loan options are available to them. This year we began a door-to-door sales program with trained salespeople “walking the streets" to contact potential customers that might require a quick loan. These are small actions that will pay off in the long term. Lima currently represents 60% of our business activity, while the remaining 40% comes from the provinces. These figures have been changing over the last few years as our focus on the outer regions increases. In the next couple of years, we may see more activity from the provinces than Lima itself.<br>We are also focusing on improving processes, as well as our online presence, both of which are important for communicating with customers. Our goal for 2016 is to achieve 15% growth in all our products and increase the share of consumer loans in our business portfolio, with a particular focus on the provinces. Inversiones La Cruz has over 84 agencies all over Peru and is the largest lender with guaranteed collateral in the Peruvian market, issuing more than 150,000 loans last year alone. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[an-agenda-to-execute]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As 2015 comes to a close, how would you rate the performance of the financial sector this year?</h4><p>On a macro level, 2015 has been a year of adjustment. The economy was hurting and we hit some lows. However, we are starting to see some recovery. In the short term, we are going to face an El Niño-like storm, and we do not know how strong it will be. The other consideration is investment and confidence from private investors. The huge success of Peru in the past has been driven by investment. In terms of numbers, we have reached an investment ratio that is close to 28% of GDP, comparable only to countries in Southeast Asia. That has been the main driver in sustained growth. In terms of the numbers for 2015, the private sector has gone down, which is bad and shows a lack of confidence or concern. As the political agenda becomes more established, things should get better.</p><h4>Mining companies dominate the local stock exchange. How are you working to educate new companies about the benefits of being listed at BVL?</h4><p>This is a cultural dynamic. For family-owned companies, getting into the stock exchange was something that nobody would have thought about 10 years ago. We are seeing more and more Colombian, Peruvian, and Chilean companies becoming regional. When companies become regional, acquisitions become more attractive. Another advantage of coming to the market is the obligation it has upon firms to operate properly. They need to report activities and have independent board members, for example. It shows that the business is run professionally and is not a closed family business.</p><h4>How would you assess the progress of Mercado Integrado Latinoamericano (MILA) after four years, and how is it creating synergies between its members? </h4><p>First, we might say to get the ball rolling is tough, but once it starts it gets easier. MILA is where the exchanges meet, but what sustains MILA as a market is what happens in the real sector, such as a Colombian company operating in Peru and Chile. As long as the real sector continues expanding on a regional basis, MILA will be sustainable and successful. There are more Colombian, Peruvian, and Chilean—even Mexican—companies investing every month. Between Colombia, Peru, and Chile, we have a USD700-800 billion economy, and if we add Mexico, we are the size of Brazil. We have 200 million inhabitants with a combined GDP of USD2 trillion. As companies continue expanding, MILA will continue to expand. In the past, we lacked a clear agenda, but the Pacific Alliance meeting in July 2015 gave us a specific agenda to execute. This includes pension funds, IPOs, and secondary markets on fixed income.</p><h4>Credicorp Capital won the Best Securities Brokerage MILA 2015 award for the region. What factors are behind this remarkable achievement?</h4><p>We have received a lot of recognition in recent years. As the brainchild of three successful companies, it is important to remember that ours is a platform built on regional knowledge and flavors. After all, people like to do business with their own kind. Our advantage is the regional platform that we have built even on top of this for things like asset management and corporate finance. This is what gives us an extra advantage.</p><h4>What are your targets and ambitions for 2016?</h4><p>One goal is to continue building the business and gaining market share as we have been doing over the past three years. Most importantly, we will continue building the culture of Credicorp. We come from three successful companies with three different backgrounds. Building up a culture takes three-five years; it is a process. As we enter our fourth year, we want to become a one-culture company. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[fighting-informality]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate banking performance in Peru in 2015?</h4><p>Peru represents 1% of the world's economy and we are not immune to the affects of large economies like China. The Peruvian economy has been performing quite well and the current government has implemented many regulatory measures to boost stronger management. However, there have been some issues in terms of politics and the mining sector; we are primarily a mining country, and two key projects have been brought to a halt. These projects foresaw a joint investment of around USD10 billion, representing 2% of GDP. This has taken its toll also in terms of social development. Inflation has been in the range of 2-3% over the last few years. However, for this year we expect a slightly higher number of 3.5%. Nevertheless, we are optimistic about 2016; elections always have an impact on the economic performance of the country and we will be holding general elections in 2016. Peru continues to grow and develop; we have developed the middle class in this country—before it did not exist. Overall, we have had a robust economic performance despite reports saying that Peru's growth has stalled. Also, since we have always been a dollarized economy, the performance of the dollar also generates certain effects within the economy and consumers. But we are trying to change this dollarized culture. For example, three to five years ago all newspaper ads were showing prices in US dollars. Today, this does not happen anymore.</p><h4>What roles does ASBANC play in the Peruvian economy?</h4><p>Our association is comprised of 16 Peruvian banks and the main concern at the moment for the banking sector is the penetration of banking and financial systems in the Peruvian population and SMEs. We are working on the implementation of new services and products such as the Electronic Purse and several others related to mobile banking. We are trying to develop a single platform for all banks. These efforts were directed to achieve wider banking inclusion in Peru, a diverse country with three differentiated regions: the coast, the Andean region, and the jungle. The challenge is to incorporate the Andean region into the financial and banking system, despite the linguistic and cultural differences. Nevertheless, we have already taken some positive steps with specialized programs targeting cities like Cusco.</p><h4>ASBANC received the Business Innovation Award for 2015. What role does innovation play in the Peruvian banking system?</h4><p>Innovation is the key element in the development of Peruvian banks. Innovation is the driving force in the development of new products and services, such as a mobile payment system that caters to a variety of outlets from paying for a cab to purchases at a pharmacy. We have to step this up and encourage people to make transactions through mobile or other digital devices. We do not want people to go to bank branches too often, mainly for security and convenience purposes.</p><h4>What is your forecast for the banking and financial sectors in Peru for the next couple of years?</h4><p>As the country grows, the banking system has to be able to accompany that growth with the required support. Without investment, there is no development, and without development there is no social development and financial inclusion. In this context, the Peruvian banking system is ready to give the needed support to the country.</p><h4>What are your targets for 2016?</h4><p>Our main target is financial inclusion. This is extremely important, because without financial inclusion we cannot fight informality in the markets. This is a big challenge and we implement regular measures and training to strengthen the banking and financial culture of Peruvians. We have also taken a leading role in the so-called Works for Taxes program. ASBANC will be supporting the development of police forces and their facilities in Peru. Many banks also participate by building schools across Peru. Education is one of the top priorities for Peruvian authorities. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Although projected economic growth in the region is falling, the IMF raised its projections for growth in Peru in 2016. What are your expectations for the Peruvian economy in 2016?</h4><p>A stable economy with a steady investment flow in infrastructure is a key component of the successful growth Peru has been experiencing in the last few years. Our forecast points to GDP growth within the range of 3.7% to 4% for the current year.</p><h4>Peru recently signed the TPP, a landmark trade agreement with 11 other Pacific-rim countries. What is the economic potential of this agreement, and how will its impact be felt in Peru?</h4><p>As any trade agreement would, the TPP offers Peru the potential to increase its exports as it gains access to a major trade region comprised of 11 countries, which together represent 40% of the global economy, 25% of global trade, 30% of FDI, and a market of more than 800 million consumers. Several studies and analyses have been conducted indicating that the TPP would generate direct benefits to Peru's agro-business, fishing, and mining industries, in addition to the retail sector, by reducing non-tariff barriers and facilitating increased integration in the production chain. Meanwhile, the World Bank estimates that the TPP could boost exports by 10% and GDP growth by 2.1% in the next 15 years. The Trade Research &amp; Development Area of the Chamber of Commerce in Lima estimates that exports will grow by 12% in the next five years. Undoubtedly, there is tremendous potential, but as in any trade agreement its definitive success depends on each country's determination to implement it in a timely fashion, to properly execute its programs, and to gain the approval of the required legislation to make it a reality.</p><h4>BLADEX offers a number of financial solutions to increase international activity and support different sectors. What financial solutions have been most useful in the Peruvian market?</h4><p>One of BLADEX's main focuses has been offering companies supply-chain solutions designed to improve their purchasing terms from suppliers and offer better selling conditions to clients. To do this we offer the vendor financing facility, a service in which BLADEX assumes the credit risk without recourse, thus allowing the parties involved to conduct more business. We also offer key support services that help companies draw up expansion plans and meet their liability management needs by offering access to funds from investors in Latin America as well as outside the region. To achieve this, we set up a special syndications and distribution platform which has already brought to market more than 30 transactions in the past few years, including eight with Peruvian companies and financial institutions.</p><h4>A commitment to the development of human capital is one of BLADEX's key values. What are some actions BLADEX is taking to be a socially responsible company?</h4><p>BLADEX is committed to being a socially responsible corporation. We understand that the concept of CSR has evolved over time from mere corporate philanthropy to becoming part of the broader corporate culture of the organization. These core values are embedded in the way we conduct our businesses and seek to impact investors, employees, communities, and the environment in a meaningful way. We have also developed a special leadership training program aimed at preparing a talented young pool of future leaders from within the organization. We pride ourselves on having a workforce that really embodies our core values of integrity, commitment, respect, humility, and excellence.</p><h4>What are some of the most significant challenges the Peruvian market faces right now?</h4><p>Among the so-called emerging markets, Latin America has been greatly affected in the past two years. Nevertheless, this impact has not been evenly felt across the region. Peru, for instance, has been one of the exceptions, as the focus on fiscal discipline, adequate and pro-active monetary policy, and investments in infrastructure have each softened the blow. Therefore, the main challenge for the country is to maintain a clear and responsible path toward sustainable growth, irrespective of the changes in the political arena.</p><h4>BLADEX recently arranged a USD25 million, three-year loan to Agrobanco. What is the importance of the agricultural sector for international trade in the region?</h4><p>The agricultural sector is Peru's second-largest export industry and is forecast to reach nearly USD6 billion in 2016 and account for 17% of the country's total exports. There has been an important increase in sales of non-traditional products such as grapes, quinoa, and blueberries, for instance. On the other hand, irrigation projects in northern and southern Peru (Alto Piura and Majes Siguas II) should also lead to considerable increases in new crops, which also bodes very well for the country. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some new innovations or services that Grupo Vital introduced in 2015?</h4><p>Grupo Vital is a company that has learned how to reinvent itself year after year according to the different changes in the marketplace. This motivation drove us to enter the mining area right at the beginning of Peru's mining boom to specialize in the workplace health segment. Technology and innovation have always been our path of choice. For mining, we developed the SISMEDIC, a unique specialized software package that represents an added value to our services, which has been well received by our clients. We are developing an innovative service in 2016, for which the principal channel will be through smartphones.</p><h4>Human resources are a common source of frustration for many Peruvian firms. How does Grupo Vital find talented workers?</h4><p>Grupo Vital supports develops its human capital across two dimensions, one being the assistance and medical division and the other being the company's operations support and administrative division. In the assistance dimension, employee selection comes through our operations management, the medical management sub-department, and medical directors that are responsible for their own operations. It is based on the academic structure and the detailed knowledge of their own results from experience and recommendations. In addition, personnel receive in-house training based on our own management model. This selection work also takes into account the experience of our clients and includes an exhaustive audit to follow up the development of the established guides. For administration, we go to the companies specialized in selection, and for middle management and personnel in general we have a selection sector in our human resources department. In terms of technical capacity, the offer of our new services within the medical dimension is well received but at the same time the most limited. However, once we become part of the team, we give our best for intern development through the determination of key personnel with specialized training and potential. With respect to Saturno as a main component of our strategy, we are a company that gives space to innovation, and we expect to attract talented and motivated professionals interested in working and being exposed to these changes. We look into the top positions in our best colleges as well as those of countries with more industry experience. We face a challenge in the labor force, which is generally low skilled, but for certain types of work workers need to be highly skilled in order to maintain quality and cost. To attract and retain these workers, we have a competitive action plan that makes our company responsible to the community through our investment in infrastructure and education, which is interesting for families thanks to our emphasis on health, knowledge, and support, and rewarding for employees. We still face many challenges to improving our local infrastructure and making more comfortable the effort of our employees. That will reinforce our current effort.</p><h4>What are your main goals for Grupo de Osma in 2016? </h4><p>Our main goal for 2016 is to invest in the right products in order to achieve 30% growth in 2017 and reach USD70 million in sales. Saturno plans to have 500-550ha of grape production by the end of 2017, marking 25% growth in a new area. Grupo Vital will invest in three new business lines in the B2C market that begin consolidating in the coming year. Within our real state operation, we should deliver in 2017 the multi-family dwellings that are currently under construction in San Isidro. By the end of 2017 there should be a 15 MW hydroelectric plant situated in Lambayeque, which we are currently developing with our partners. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did Peru's large economic slowdown in 2015 affect the company?</h4><p>The slowdown hit us on several fronts, including real estate, which is relatively new for us. In 2001, one sqm of unimproved non-shore land in Paracas 250km south of Lima was worth USD5. Right now, one sqm is worth about 70 times that. Because of this growth between 2005 and 2015, people were buying pretty much anything. The slowdown resulted in significantly less people willing to buy secondary homes such as beach houses. In Lima, there is a tremendous amount of office space for sale. That demand has greatly slowed down. At one point it even came to a complete halt. We had to reduce our prices by 30% for buyers to be interested. It went from being a seller's market to a buyer's market. The year 2015 was more difficult in other areas, but not because of customers not wanting our products—we had important growth in snacks and also in chemicals. One of our important customers is the Ecuadorian government, which began having problems a year and a half ago because of oil and commodity prices. It was doing well a few years ago, but suddenly the bottom fell out. It was an extremely challenging year for several reasons</p><h4>What can be done about the challenges of logistics in Peru?</h4><p>The problem is that Peru is tens of billions of dollars behind. I made an estimate six or seven years ago that Peru was USD50 billion behind in having all the roads, schools, and hospitals that it needed. The World Bank said it was USD48 billion; however, that was six or seven years ago. Now, the figure for infrastructure alone is much higher. There are two main areas: essential infrastructure for the country to function; and a whole other infrastructure to develop what is important in terms of projections for the future tourism, mining, and so on. Those are not being developed right now. Currently, there is a tentative rebirth of confidence.</p><h4>What is the importance of Grupo Custer's international presence?</h4><p>We have been historically involved in Peru and Ecuador—Peru since 1922 and Ecuador since 1935. From the 1970s, we were in Chile. We had a manufacturing company in Chile, which we got out of a few years ago; however, we will probably go back to the agribusiness sector there. We are beginning to cover all of Central America, starting from Costa Rica. We develop products for the Panamanian and Nicaraguan markets and will move beyond, for example into Guatemala. We have studied building a business in Mexico but are still working on the countries we are in because we only recently opened Bolivia.</p><h4>How is your company introducing modern standards and knowledge generation in Peru?</h4><p>In agrochemicals, we have become extremely involved in seeds and hybrid seeds, and we are in the process of building a plant in northern Peru to process and produce seeds for the solarium. By working on hybrid seeds, we try to move out of the older business because the stronger the seeds, the less they need our traditional products, of which there are more than 100 in the agrochemical area. We also invest a great deal in bio-nutrients and bio-pesticides. If we continue to develop seeds and see promising results, we will eventually grow out of our old business and into the new one. In food, we are redesigning all of our lines, paying more attention to the entire chain of production, from how it is raised to its processes. We pursue much more variety in our snacks and have a new line of organic snacks coming out. We also work within our neighboring communities, which is what my son Felipe focuses on, providing training to farmers. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does the TPP play into Peru's plans for exports?</h4><p>Around 92% of destinations for our agribusiness exports are covered by FTAs. The TPP will provide an opportunity to add other countries not previously covered by our 19 existing FTAs. New markets are welcome; however, we need to explore the current markets. Peru has an FTA with the US, the EU, and China. One-third of Peru's exports go to North America, Europe, and Asia; China accounts for 90% of our Asian market. We need to fully explore what we have already signed. Proper diversification and increasing the value-added products that we can export will have a greater impact on the TPP. There were 200,000 visitors to Peru 25 years ago, while in 2015 we recorded 3.4 million. It is increasing because the country offers much more than Machu Picchu, but not all of the opportunities have been exploited. Peru has 44,000 locations of valuable ancient ruins, of which Machu Picchu is just one. While these 3.4 million visitors sounds like a high figure, Spain receives around 50 million per year, even though Peru has more land than Spain. We need to leverage our gastronomy, culture, and landscapes to attract more tourists, which will require investments in infrastructure, hotels, roads, airports, and more. Right now, we also do not have enough good investments in manufacturing innovation, so perhaps other countries are currently more of an attractive location for establishing the regional headquarters of international manufacturing corporations. We need to be more competitive to attract these companies, but it will take some time. Any improvements to the tax code would take place at the end of the second or third year of the new administration.</p><h4>Where do you see potential for development in education?</h4><p>Education is a key driver to boost the development of the country, but two years ago we were last in the region of the countries that took the PISA exam. We are no longer last, but we have a huge gap to close, and we need to increase investments in education. We face some obstacles to doing that. Education in Peru has so much space to increase in performance that several private investors and businesspeople are discovering interesting ways to explore and develop it. Local banks and mining companies are founding their own schools and universities. People who want to teach various subjects in their own free hours can be appointed by an NGO to teach in a school. They already have an impact of more than 700 teachers in Lima and many more in the north of Peru.</p><h4>What about EY makes it an attractive destination for students?</h4><p>We create a competitive offerings for the 1,300 people that work not just in Lima, but also in Chiclayo and Arequipa. We are a professional services firm that is decentralized, and we offer the same careers all over the country to avoid having to transfer people and their families. They can now have the same EY experience in their own cities. They are excited and our clients there also support us by requesting our services, because their own people work together with their families and our managers. We are technical, open-minded, business-oriented, and connected to the world. I like to prepare people to have their own way of doing what they do for fun, but also supporting our clients. We have an interesting initiative, whereby a group of our people in EY draft their own initiatives, regulations, and norms that can be used to boost investments and present these changes to congress. Ultimately, all I need to do is to support them, prepare them, and help our collaborators to be more successful and better. What I offer is an open and clear professional opportunity to everyone. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Is enough being invested in education in Peru?</h4><p>Only 3.5% of GDP goes to education annually, and less of 0.15% of GDP goes to science, technology, and innovation, far below what it should be. It was worse before former-President Humala's government. It is the first time a government has looked at this issue and begun to increase the budget, but far more is needed. The problem is that we are in a vicious circle because public universities are funding deprived and lack human resources and there are private, for-profit universities that do not care about a superior education. Decision makers do not understand the importance of knowledge in the economy. One of our roles at CONCYTEC is to show the value of knowledge, science, technology, and innovation for growth and development. We aim to educate people, from politicians to the average people, through interviews, promotional campaigns, conferences, workshops, and meetings. We want knowledge to be seen as something that migrates and flows, creating added value and transforming into products and services that can benefit everyone. Things are already changing, people are talking about innovation, and the government is spending more money on R&amp;D, but there is a long way to go.</p><h4>Only 3% of companies in Peru maintain continuous collaboration with universities. How can this be changed?</h4><p>The academic and research body of Peru is weak, because there has not been any input for decades. This disconnect happens because there was no public sector support and the private sector never sought help from such a weak body. Whenever the need arose, the private sector sourced it from outside the country. To rectify this situation, we have to invest in and establish precise instruments, find the requisite financing, and set up transfer of knowledge offices in universities. This is not just about creating offices, but training people and sending them abroad if necessary. We need to finance R&amp;D initiatives that bring together businesses, universities, and research institutions and develop a common language. We also have initiatives to create centers of excellence as part of a small group of firms to address their innovation needs. They come up with a list of needs then approach a research institute or university, and a research institute abroad, and the three of them create a center of excellence with the aim of creating the products that they want and solving the problems that need solving. We aim to build such synergies and research circles to find holistic solutions to common problems.</p><h4>What specific segments do you think are lagging most in terms of innovation?</h4><p>The entire economy would benefit from more R&amp;D capacity and solutions. We need innovation and knowledge to increase efficiency and productivity across the economy. There are exceptions, with leading groups in different sectors, like agriculture, for example. But much more needs to be done. We continue our promotional efforts, trying to show the successes of those who have invested in innovation, and showing the public in general how important R&amp;D is. We need to create a demand for the market of knowledge. This is the first time in Peru's history that there has been a policy on science, technology, and innovation, and we helped formulate it in consensus with all sectors. Four members of the board of CONCYTEC come from the private sector: CONFIEP, the National Society of Industry, the Chamber of Commerce of Lima, and the Peruvian Chambers of Commerce. The board also includes private universities, public universities, intellectual property entities, the National Academy of Sciences, and the Ministry of Economy. The success of CONCYTEC is this broad coalition and consensus that we have. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>During 2016, oil prices witnessed constant rebounds, adding to better growth rate expectations for the UAE. How have these factors impacted the Central Bank's expansionary policies for 2017?</h4><p>As oil prices nearly doubled from the low levels reached early this year, the concerns that oil prices could fall to low 20s turned out to be baseless, which was obviously good news for the UAE's economic outlook. The Central Bank's estimate is that non-oil activities will continue to grow by about 2.7—2.8% in 2016 and 2017, which is a respectable performance compared to global growth, notwithstanding the impact of the fall in oil receipts on our economy, which we are keen to contain going forward. The Central Bank remains determined to maintain its continued commitment to the fixed peg of the dirham's exchange rate against the US dollar. However, we are keen to increase our capacity to manage liquidity to weather the impacts of external shocks, while adhering to the direction of US interest rate policy. Under these conditions, our focus is on the liquidity needs of banks with a forward-looking agenda. To that end, our research is currently focusing on the scope to activate the macro prudential instruments we have at our disposal and develop contingency plans to weather the adverse effects of global shocks on the domestic economy. This said, it could never be overstated that monetary instruments aim at managing liquidity to maintain resources for private sector activity. However, as experiences around the globe have demonstrated, available liquidity should be coordinated with fiscal and structural policies to boost investors' confidence. The consortium of policies should be growth conducive to enhance our economic prospects to support the non-energy sector in the medium term.</p><h4>How will the full economic diversification redesign fiscal and monetary policy when this target is met in 2021?</h4><p>The UAE has been successful in diversifying its economy away from oil. Moreover, the strategies adopted by the UAE's 2021 Vision, Abu Dhabi's Economic Vision 2030, and Dubai's Strategic Plan 2015 are all intended to attract foreign capital to promising activities, especially export-oriented sectors such as manufacturing, transport and logistics, tourism, telecommunications, renewable energies, and aviation. To support these activities, the government has played a leading role in infrastructure and regulatory developments that have boosted growth prospects in non-oil activities over time. To ensure sustainability in the wake of the recent decline of the oil price, the government has implemented necessary reforms to diversify fiscal revenues while reining in public expenditure in a gradual manner to increase fiscal sustainability. In parallel, policy coordination has necessitated diversifying sources of financing with the goal of reducing reliance on domestic liquidity and safeguarding credit growth in support of private sector activity.</p><h4>You have been an advocate for the expansion of banking loans to SMEs and startups. What are the main incentives the Central Bank is currently offering to commercial banks to deepen credit to this segment of the economy?</h4><p>Supporting SMEs is a strategic decision taken by the federal government, which has been a priority in the wake of the oil price decline. The first step in this direction was the issuance of the SME Law in 2014, which led to the creation of the SME Council. The Ministry of Economy is taking the lead in this regard and is fully cooperating with us to promote this vital sector. In the particular case of the Central Bank, we are committed to playing a fundamental role in the capitalization of SMEs and startups. We set up a team whose main task is to make proposals on ways and means the Central Bank could contribute to the implementation the SME Law, in coordination with the concerned stakeholders.</p><h4>The IMF has been outspoken about the need to cut deficits in the GCC nations to maintain currency pegs. What action has the UAE taken to cut the deficit and how is the peg signaling a positive outlook on the Emirati economy to investors?</h4><p>We agree with the IMF on the need for fiscal discipline in order to maintain fiscal sustainability and ensure the stability of the fixed peg regime. In the UAE, the government of Abu Dhabi took the lead by reviewing water and energy prices in 2014, which reduced the subsidy burden on the fiscal budget. In August 2015, the federal government pressed ahead with the reform of the energy subsidy system, with the aim to align local energy prices to international levels, and improve the overall fiscal outlook of the UAE. Reining in the budget deficit requires actions on both the revenue and the spending sides. Reforms have focused on diversifying non-energy revenues. On the spending side, fiscal consolidation aims to strike a balance between growth priorities and ensuring sustainability. In this regard, the UAE could afford to pace fiscal consolidation gradually in light of available sources of financing, including financial buffers accumulated by the sovereign wealth funds. The ample international reserves the Central Bank relies on, signify a solid background to out commitment to the stability of the exchange rate peg. Other GCC countries took similar actions albeit at varying degrees, therefore, we remain confident in our ability as GCC countries to keep the fixed peg regime.</p><h4>You recently approved the five-year strategy for the Central Bank to match the financial targets stipulated in the UAE 2021 Plan. How will these objectives contribute to the further enhancement of regulations and to the Emiratization of the banking sector?</h4><p>Emiratization is an important strategic task embedded in the UAE Vision 2021. It is high on our agenda. The banking sector is already employing 38,000 Emiratis as of the end of August 2016, which compares favorably with other private sector activities. Nevertheless, this is no reason for complacency. Banks continue to attract high caliber Emiratis for preferred career destinations. We are planning to introduce a new points system to incentivize the Emiratization plan in the banking system. The new system will focus on quantity and quality of UAE nationals as banks will achieve their target points through the hiring, developing, and training of UAE nationals. To that end, the system rewards the commitment of banks in hiring more nationals at different levels. As regards regulatory developments, ensuring a strong and well-regulated banking system in the UAE is important for enhancing the UAE's reputation as a financial services center. The CBUAE's 2017-2021 Strategy supports this objective. Therefore, in line with developments at the international level, we have an ambitious regulatory development program underway. We are in the process of migrating the banking sector towards Basel III standards for capital and liquidity. We are also upgrading regulatory requirements in relation to risk management at banks. In 2017, we will put forward a major piece of work in a new overarching Corporate Governance regulation for consultation with the banking sector. We will also continue to progress other regulations in the pipeline such as financial reporting, internal controls, compliance, and internal audit and outsourcing. The regulatory framework for non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) is also currently under review, with a view to enhancing their organization, development, regulation, and supervisory oversight. Last but not least, we recognize that the development of FinTech will play an important role in shaping the future of the financial services industry in the UAE. In this regard, we are in the process of finalizing two new regulations in this area, namely, digital payments and crowdfunding.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the company evolved since its incorporation?</h4><p>The ICE is a state company which from the beginning was responsible for the development of telecommunications in Costa Rica. One of the main focuses at the beginning was on rural telephony and the expansion of fixed-line telephones across the country. We have gone through every different stage of development, and today we have an IP-based system. We have developed a 4G mobile network and we are improving coverage and the service quality of the overall mobile network. What is more, we started to build up a brand for the telecommunications industry and put social and environmental responsibility at the forefront of our priorities, as well as human resources. This is when the logo of the frog and the name of the company kölbi were created. In 2011, we sold 1.25 million prepaid licenses, a strategy based on getting ready for further competition in the industry with the entry of foreign companies. Thanks to that decision, when these foreign firms first arrived, they saw a slightly more mature market in which we already had a strong position. Today, we have 4 million customers, which represent 60% market share. In terms of income, 70% comes from individual customers, whereas the remaining 30% comes from businesses. In the business segment, we are also market leaders. However, when it comes to TV services, we only own 2% of the market share. One of our particularities is that we compete with all the companies operating in the IT industry in Costa Rica, which is currently at least 136 firms. Having said that, we need to focus on one or two segments in the industry; we cannot cover them all. That's why we have two sister companies, Radiográfica Costa Rica and Cable Visión. The latter company sells television and internet services for home, while Radiográfica Costa Rica focuses on government services and large companies. In this context, we are currently in the process of redefining our entire strategy.</p><h4>In which areas is kölbi investing the most?</h4><p>We want to redefine our entire technological future, for Costa Rica has always been a leading and pioneering country in Latin America in terms of IT services. However, certain macroeconomic problems in Costa Rica have led to a reduction of investment in IT, putting all that innovation on hold. We are trying to get back on track, which is why we have a project to implement fiber optics across the country. We have already started with small-scale projects and in highly targeted areas that have been successful. Costa Rica is a demanding and consuming society in terms of IT services and products. Today, we focus on renovating our infrastructure from copper to fiber optics in order to become a company providing tools and content to our customers, as well as internet services and content on fully-digital platforms through a robust high-speed network.</p><h4>How do you foresee the sector evolving, and how will kölbi contribute to this development?</h4><p>We still need to implement certain regulatory reforms in the industry. For example, we are one of the few countries with flat-rate mobile data charges. This has drawn bad media attention to the country, for we are one step behind in terms of tariffs in comparison to similar markets. We currently have tariffs that were set at the end of the 1990s. I think that as a country we have not learned from our mistakes in the past. We need to move toward the liberalization of the mobile market. This does not mean raising tariffs in the market, as many think, but creating more effective competition in the market between players, which will lead to more competitive tariffs in order to attract more customers. We will also see an increase in the quality of services. At kölbi, we prioritize the customer experience. Current regulation has definitely deactivated investment in the industry. We have to learn from other markets such as Uruguay and Chile. The regulatory organization has almost nothing to do with the setting of the tariffs, and we need to move toward a market in which competition regulates the market. In terms of internet penetration, we are one of the leading countries, but when it comes to broadband, we are at almost the bottom of the queue. We need investments and regulations adapted to the current needs of the market.</p><h4>kölbi currently reaches 89% of Costa Rican territory and is the leading mobile service provider in terms of coverage. What strategy will you implement to keep this edge?</h4><p>I was appointed as General Manager in 2014. When I assessed the company's situation I realized that despite covering almost all the country's geography, this did not imply good performance. In the past few years we have grown our customer base effectively. However, investment in infrastructure did not follow at the same level. Our customers were not fully satisfied with our services, despite the wide coverage. We now focus on strengthening some areas of our coverage and optimizing our network, one of our main focuses since 2014. We have invested more resources in our data, amplifying licenses and controlling traffic. We have also started the installation of new infrastructure spaces. One main objective is to provide a better customer experience to our users. All in all, we have doubled our capacity and coverage in mobile infrastructure since 2014. Finally, we invest heavily in our people and in training.</p><h4>What are your priorities for 2017?</h4><p>Our priorities are the introduction of Fiber to the Home (FTTH), the finalization of content provision services, and the doubling of our mobile network points. We aim to introduce new technologies and services thanks to the multi-frequency antennas we plan to install. Ultimately, we plan on implementing and expanding the use LTE/4G technology for data.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You recently stated that the government will set up a National Endowment for the Arts (NEA). What type of incentives will this institution offer?</h4><p>We realized that the creative arts, in particular music, film, culture and literature, are facing challenges due to a lack of institutional funding. Because of that, they have had to think very small until now and were unable to achieve anything of any magnitude. The challenge that creative industries face in Nigeria is piracy within the distribution chain, and that is partly due to the failure of government to protect the intellectual rights of this community. At the base of all this is the fact that unlike other sectors, the arts lack a specific bank or fund, which can be found in other sectors such as with the Bank of Agriculture, where applicants can get funding at a rate that is almost subsidized. In the case of creative industries it is even more challenging as it is an unstructured industry. It thrives on the talents and skills of individuals. What is being achieved today in the music and film industries has been largely done without governmental support. If we are able to support them with the National Endowment Fund we can definitely boost the sector.</p><h4>What measures is the Ministry implementing to combat piracy?</h4><p>Piracy is a problem of monstrous proportions. Out of every ten movies eight are pirated. There have been several suggestions as to how to tackle the issue. Our experience in fighting piracy in the entertainment industry is that we cannot continue to fight piracy using the same methods and tools as in the past. Pirates are well funded, motivated, and organized. The incentive is huge because from investing nothing they can make millions of dollars out of the sweat of artists. Piracy is not just restricted to films and music but it goes to books and even goes to cable and satellite television. We need a combination of factors to fight pirates. We need to strengthen the capacity and abilities of all the agencies that fight piracy. The police need to be encouraged and I would recommend a national task force against piracy, as it is a real economic crime. Moving from analog to digital broadcasting will also help because it will make it easier for filmmakers and musicians to release their work directly to the channels, hence unofficial channels will have less success.</p><h4>Nollywood is the world's third-biggest producer of feature films. How would you describe the importance of the motion picture industry for the culture and economic development of the country?</h4><p>The Nigerian film industry has done much more in marketing Nigeria than the structured efforts of the government. With little or no control from the government they have been able to project a positive view of our culture and generate cultural ambassadors. In terms of whether or not it has contributed to the economy, we have not yet been able to put in place a system that can correctly quantify their contribution to the GDP. This has to do with piracy and the distribution structure. Today we do not have more than 60 cinemas around the country and I have been working with various local governments and the post offices to see how we can help with distribution of these products and help filmmakers earn their due. Another problem that the industry has is that the industry is not united. They are organized through guilds; a guild of directors, a guild of producers, a guild of photographers, a guild of cinematographers, and because of this they do not speak with one unified voice. I am working with them to get the Motion Pictures Council of Nigeria (Mopicon) bill passed into law. This will help address the challenges facing them such as piracy, distribution, and funding. I intend to create the Mopicon committee next week with leaders from the various guilds so we can really agree on the draft bill to lobby the legislature and get that law passed.</p><h4>Several times you have advocated the revival of festivals. What major cultural initiatives can be expected to take place in Nigeria in 2016?</h4><p>We are trying to create a calendar of festivals. I have asked my cultural department to reach out to their counterparts in all the states and have asked the various directors of culture within the various states to give us a list of at least ten festivals in their state in order of priority and importance. When I have that compendium, I can market the various festivals. So if anybody is coming to Nigeria he or she will have an idea of what festival is taking place at any particular time. I am also working with the British Council and we have a couple of seminars and workshops on the creative industry and part of this concerns conducting research on the various creative industries. Festivals are a veritable source of job creation. For example, it takes 100 people to dress up one masquerade in the eastern part of Nigeria, and another 100 people to undress it. So if that festival is going to last for one week, then it will employ hundreds of people for that week. These are what we are looking into where culture is not just about entertainment but a veritable economy. Creative industries, of which festivals are a part, create a local economy for the local people which will help stem urban to rural migration and help with the main objective of the government and to diversify the economy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is required to stimulate entrepreneurship in the country, especially for SMEs?</h4><p>We currently have 17 free trade agreements and more in preparation; we are members of the Pacific Alliance, APEC, and TPP, and all this makes it necessary to be more competitive and in order to be more competitive, we have to be cheaper, faster, and more effective in what we do. There was a mentality in the government that the strength of our economy was entirely dependent on global economic factors, which certainly have an impact, but it became an excuse not to facilitate entrepreneurial activity among Peruvian companies. Now it is up to the next government to reduce barriers and obstacles, facilitate economic activities, and implement the appropriate regulations and laws to support the labor force and educational system for long-term development. The informal sector accounts for 74% of total national labor and about 60% of economic activity, so it is important to formalize.</p><h4>How will the TPP impact the Peruvian economy and what is its potential?</h4><p>There is always potential in every measure we take to be more globalized because it opens up possibilities to have wider markets and to enter markets at lower costs. On the other hand, as long as we are members and others are not, we open up possibilities for entities to sell their products through us in these globalized market spaces. It is an investment opportunity for people of other countries to generate their products with us and sell them in the markets we now have easy access to.</p><h4>What segments of the national economy have significant potential for new companies to invest and operate?</h4><p>There is considerable potential to invest in the economy and the main opportunities are in infrastructure development. While the government has yet to privatize many services, there is strong potential to do so, opening opportunities to construct roads, railways, metros, and even to distribute energy to other countries. There is potential to add value to our raw materials; instead of exporting copper we can export copper wires and copper electrical products, which could be manufactured in Peru. There are also opportunities to export agricultural products, particularly fruits and vegetables and commodities unique to Peru such as quinoa. We have about 2,000 different varieties of potatoes so there is definitely potential to develop something there as well.</p><h4>How is the chamber positioned to develop a synergy between the business community and the government?</h4><p>Our main function is to facilitate dialog about challenges facing the private sector, and to give the private sector a space to participate in the discussion. We have large events throughout the year to talk with specialists, and we invite academics from different parts of the world to give lectures. We are not only discussing general economic issues, but there is also a constant dialog with different entities of the government. We do not defend any one interest of our members; rather we develop general strategies and defend general-interest principles.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2016 in terms of economic performance and what are the chamber's priority targets for the end of the year? </h4><p>We had elections this year, and economic activity is typically halted during elections. However, this election season we are confident that we will have continuity, and it is the first time in the history of Peru that we have had 25 years of constant development and political continuity. We try to unify our development process. For example, we want our doctors, investors, and financial institutions to have internationally recognized credentials and functions and global access to opportunities. The Pacific Alliance is not only a free trade agreement zone, it is also more comparable to the eurozone. Peru is a member of APEC and for the second time the APEC meeting will be held in Lima, which is a tremendous opportunity to make this a stronger, more competitive market. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Primary indicators show that Peru is an open and reliable country for doing business. How is AmCham Peru positioned to support and foster investment in the country?</h4><p>Peru's development stems from certain factors. In the past we had a period of high inflation, strong devaluation, fiscal deficit, a dearth of foreign reserves, a balance of payment deficit, and unstable macroeconomic figures. It was difficult to predict what would happen. The country was characterized as a closed economy. In the 1970s the government owned almost every major productive activity, and there was plenty of protectionism, which led to high prices and a lack of quality for customers. In the 1990s the government began to change these conditions, placing a stronger emphasis on stabilizing the economy. The consequence of macroeconomic stability and the openness of the economy has been predictability, which has been important for trade and investment. AmCham Peru has 5,000 representatives from 580 companies from all over the world, 30% from the US. For the Chamber, all companies operating in Peru are Peruvian companies. Some have US capital, others Peruvian capital, but all of them share the same environment, the same stakeholders, the same problems and benefits, and the same overall situation. They share good practices and experiences at AmCham and we work with them toward the solution of some common issues. First of all we foster trade and investment, and we try to defend the interests of our members. In that sense, during the process of the negotiation of the first free trade agreement, we realized 18 missions to the US Congress and visited 351 Congressmen, Senators, and Representatives. On every trip, we took with us the general managers of US companies operating in Peru to visit their representatives and they let them know that the TLC was good for the US, for Peru, and for companies operating in Peru, whether American or Peruvian. The information that we brought with us was related to the import requirements or potential exports of their state, as well as details on their companies that were operating in Peru in order to demonstrate that both parties could benefit. Today, we undertake about nine to 10 missions to fairs in the US, helping SMEs because often they do not have the right knowledge of visas, customs, or language to set up appointments with potential buyers. In that respect, AmCham Peru is happy to help. AmCham Peru also receives missions from the US, covering all segments of the economy.</p><h4>What are the main challenges that companies and investors face when they decide to do business in Peru?</h4><p>The main challenge is to learn the country, the culture, and the availability of goods or services. Companies do not usually engage in business immediately when they go to a country. The first step is getting to know the potential partners. The second challenge is to improve the institutions and to reduce the bureaucratic procedures, help businesses, investors, producers, and consumers. We have to make things easier. Third, we still lack a great deal of infrastructure—Peru clearly needs more airports, ports, and roads. The country has developed greatly over the past 20 years, with an expanding middle class and reduced levels of poverty. However, as the country grows, it also needs better infrastructure, institutions, services, and qualified people. In summary, the country has developed, but its still faces a long process with many challenges. It still has to fight to reduce poverty even more, but with stability and openness of the economy, we will be able to attract investment and create more jobs. It is a difficult process, but the results will be rewarding. The country has to continue doing the right things. Sometimes, politicians forget that the best way to fight poverty is by attracting investment. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe Peru's economic performance in 2015?</h4><p>Last year was not a good year for the global economy; nonetheless, Peru's performance was above most other Latin American countries despite only having 3% growth. That was an improvement on the country's 2.4% growth in 2014. What is significant is that this 3% was achieved because in 2H2015 there was a clear increase in the growth rate, especially in the last month of the year. In 2016, growth of 3.5 to 4% is expected, driven by the implementation of major infrastructure projects and the entry into production of new mines. The importance of commodities in our exports and the strong relationship with certain markets, such as China, has a huge influence on the performance of the economy. This is something that has to be solved over the coming years. Promoting the diversification of our economy is one of the challenges for the incoming administration.</p><h4>How does ProInversión work to create and reinforce the synergies between the private and public sectors, and to promote projects based on the PPP model?</h4><p>Over the past few years we have awarded more than USD15 billion in different projects. These have mainly been in infrastructure. Currently, we are also working in education and health. The idea is to continue that trend. The Peruvian government has recently improved the regulations on PPPs in order to incorporate best practices recommended by the OECD's Principles for the Public Governance of PPP, to consolidate a clear, predictable, and legitimate institutional framework supported by competent and well-resourced authorities, to ground the selection of PPP partnerships in value for money, and to use the budgetary process transparently to minimize fiscal risks and ensure the integrity of the procurement process.</p><h4>What are the main challenges a foreign direct investor faces when coming to Peru?</h4><p>Peru has no external barriers to FDI and has an open economy. We have established an attractive investment policy dating back to the 1990s. We have consolidated this policy with our free trade agreements. There are almost no restrictions on any kinds of economic activity, just a few on some professional services, but they are not important restrictions. We allow for the free movement of capital. Foreign investors have the same rights and obligations as local investors under our national treatment principle. We have to work on investment facilitation to eliminate the red tape that still exists, especially at the local government level. This is particularly the case in the interior of the country, where we need to improve governance. We have to work with them to review the procedures for licenses and permits. We are looking to everyone in the world who wants to assume the challenge of Peruvian development. We do not have a geographical preference regarding the origin of our investors; we are open to everyone, but we want the best. We want the best operators for our PPP projects and the top companies for each activity. This is the only way we can return to 5-6% growth levels. Peru will be able to recover this level of growth in the coming years, most likely after 2016. There is a strong macroeconomic basis for this growth because Peru's fiscal policy is clear and it will not change regardless of who is in power. The way forward for us is clear and there will not be any dramatic changes. Foreign companies can set up facilities in Peru in order to turn the country into a hub and an export platform in order to reach the markets that are opened up through our free trade agreements, now including the TPP. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[The Lessons of Carabayllo: Making Tough Choices]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[the-lessons-of-carabayllo-making-tough-choices]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Peru is a far more prosperous and just society today than a generation ago. Over the past 10 years, Peru's GDP has increased at an average rate of over 6% each year. During the boom years, strong domestic demand and high commodity prices fueled a decade of robust growth. Growth was inclusive and the size of the middle class became larger than that of the poor. But Peru, like other countries in Latin America, is now feeling the headwinds of a slowing global economy, with lower commodity prices that may stay depressed for some time, and an exodus of capital from developing countries that seems to be accelerating.</p><p>The question we ask today is how we can help developing countries grow in the face of slow global growth, the end of the commodities super-cycle, pending interest rate hikes, and capital flight from emerging markets. In tough times, countries that do well have already made the difficult choices. But countries that have not yet still can; it is not too late. Every effort must be made to improve productivity. And in a period when banks are de-risking, we have to ensure that capital is accessible—especially for small business owners and entrepreneurs who will create jobs. More specifically, countries should invest in women, which can be one of the most effective pro-growth strategies by any government. Closing the gender gap can raise incomes by 14% in Latin America and the Caribbean. Government officials also must root out corruption wherever it exists and promote transparency in official business that can prevent future corruption. </p><p>Peru's Minister of Education, Jaime Saavedra, was one of our top macroeconomists at the World Bank before he accepted his current position. As a brilliant economist, Jaime knew that Peru's future would depend on a more effective educational system. With former-President Humala's strong leadership, Peru has increased its education budget by 90% and important reforms are under way. Peru has also been a leader in investing in the health and well-being of women and children. It uses results-based financing to reward programs that produced better health, social development, and sanitation outcomes, and it targets assistance to those areas most in need, resulting in rapid progress in rural areas and the poorest communities. Latin America has set a high global standard for ensuring that people avoid poverty, and one of the best programs is Peru's Programa Juntos, which began a decade ago. Juntos has reached half a million poor families with conditional cash transfers worth USD38 dollars each month, based on regular health and nutrition checkups for young children.</p><p>When it comes to insuring people against risks, one of the most frightening threats is climate change. The warmer our planet becomes, the more we will experience droughts, floods, stronger hurricanes and typhoons, and brushfires that consume vast forests. There is in the Pacific right now the El Niño phenomena, which some are predicting to cause more havoc than any Niñicitos in generations. Ocean temperatures off the coast of Peru are as high as 6 degrees Celsius above normal. Led by countries around the world and funding from the multilateral development banks—including the World Bank Group—we are seeing that there is a politically credible pathway toward the USD100 billion promised ahead of the Paris Conference of the Parties. We will significantly scale up our commitments to battling climate change. In Lima, we focused on tough choices that will underpin growth, investment, and safety. Governments now must make tough choices in order to grow their economies in a way that helps the poorest. With every reform we make, with every road we build, with every health clinic we support—there are millions, even billions of people, who only want a chance to live and pursue their dreams. We must do all we can, together, to ensure that every person on this earth can live a more dignified, healthier, and more prosperous life. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You recently visited Peru to meet with President Humala. Which areas were identified as having the most potential for increased cooperation between the two nations? €¨</h4><p>Turkey is the sixth most popular tourism destination in the world with 36.8 million visitors and USD34.3 billion in revenue as of 2014. Peru offers a wealth of unique touristic attractions.  Many Turkish people have heard of and are attracted to Machu Picchu as one of the new Seven Wonders of the World.  With adequate investment incentives provided by Peruvian authorities, Turkish firms could engage in tourism projects in this country and share their experience.  One of the most important areas of expertise of Turkish companies is construction. There are about 250 world-class contractors operating around the globe.  43 of these are Turkish companies. Turkey ranks second after China, which has 65 international construction companies.  The total value of projects completed by Turkish companies in other countries has reached USD250 billion. As we know, Peru will make huge investments in its infrastructure in the coming years. Turkish contractors could make a significant contribution in this regard as highly motivated new partners and competitors of foreign companies that have been active in Peru since long time.</p><h4>Negotiations are underway to establish a multilateral Free Trade Agreement between Turkey and several countries in Central America. What is the importance of Peru's involvement in this? €¨</h4><p>Four rounds of negotiations for the Free Trade Agreement have been completed yet. Both sides have some priorities and concerns, but we can overcome these inherent difficulties. The leaders of both countries have expressed their intention to sign the Free Trade Agreement in June this year and the negotiating teams have been instructed to reach that objective. The negotiating teams will meet in Ankara this March with the goal to finalize the FTA. Turkey, connecting Asia and Europe both commercially and culturally, has one of the largest economies and markets in its region. As the world's 18th and Europe's seventh largest economy, our purchasing power parity (PPP) per capita income exceeded USD19,000 in 2014. From 2002 to 2014, our per capita income has grown from USD3,492 to USD10,404 at constant prices. In the same period, Peru has achieved high economic growth rates, mostly over 5% per annum. It is noteworthy that Peru is on the way to become a member of OECD and a party to the Trans Pacific Agreement signed on February 3, 2016 in Auckland, New Zealand. The inward foreign direct investments (FDI) performance of Peru is also impressive. In 2013, Peru was the most attractive country for investment in Latin America according to the FDI/GDP Index. The Free Trade Agreement could serve as a lasting and appealing bridge, not only between Peru and Turkey but between the two regions as well. We do not see Peru merely as a bilateral trade partner. Peru is a strategic hub for our economic cooperation and partnership with the region at large.  Our recent bilateral trade volume of USD260 million does not reflect the existing potential between Turkey and Peru. </p><h4>How do you envision the future of bilateral relations between the two countries? What are the Turkish government's goals and ambitions to be achieved over the medium term? €¨</h4><p>Bilateral relations have made progress since 2010. There is still a lot of work ahead. We need to sign and ratify certain key agreements soon, most important of which is the FTA.  We need to pay mutually more official visits. The role of governments is to pave the way for the people and entrepreneurs to proceed. Our goal is to increase the currently modest bilateral trade volume to USD1 billion in the next five years. We would like to see Turkish contractors and investors start their projects in Peru already this year. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What advantages and incentives do Peruvian investors enjoy when doing business in Honduras?</h4><p>In terms of investment, we agreed on an FTA and this presents the provisions agreed upon by which we give legal security to investors, including also provisions for the regulation and protection of Honduran and Peruvian investments and investors, ensuring compliance with the principles of national treatment, most favored nation status, minimum standard of treatment in accordance with customary international law, implementation of environmental measures, as well as special treatment in case of unrest, expropriation, and compensation. It also incorporates a special mechanism to resolve investment disputes. On top of that, Honduras is an attractive and opportunity laden market in sectors such as infrastructure, tourism, agribusiness, and services, in which we enjoy a favorable legal framework established by the Law on Promotion and Protection of Investment approved in 2011 and the Law on Public-Private-Partnerships, among others.</p><h4>An FTA between Honduras and Peru was recently signed. How do you expect this new agreement to promote trade between the two countries and how attractive is the Peruvian economy for Honduran companies?</h4><p>Thanks to the realization of the treaty, we open Honduran exports to a market comprising a population of 31.1 million, offering an interesting range of opportunities for both Honduran agricultural and industrial exports to the Peruvian market. In South America, Peru is the fifth destination of Honduran exports and the third country with the largest volume of imports from Honduras, after Colombia and Brazil. Strategically, Honduras will be favored in the medium term to serve as an import-export traffic route from countries like Chile, Peru, and other South American countries in the Pacific, offering its already underway logistical advantages and construction plans—future construction of the Port of Amapala, the Palmerola Airport, the Dry Canal corridor, extending the CA-5 highway, and the modernization of Puerto Cortes and Puerto Castilla represent both advantages and attractive points for investment, as well as import and export activities through Honduras. The treaty gives the signatory parties a legal framework for clear, stable, and transparent rules to regulate trade, services, and investment, as well as mechanisms to avoid the application of discretionary measures unjustifiably affecting trade, establish legal security and predictability for economic operators, expand options for consumers to purchase goods and services, and found effective and transparent procedures for the settlement of disputes. It also expands opportunities for the productive sector of Honduras to take advantage, with interest and determination, of the economic spaces that are created with the entry into force of the treaty. The trade balance between Honduras and Peru leans at this time in favor of the latter; however, with the recently signed FTA, Honduran companies are expected to take advantage of the benefits granted in this instrument through access to markets that allow productive linkages and opportunities to diversify market portfolios. The treaty will help the Peruvian market to open its doors to our products. It is a market little explored by Honduran businesses. The strategic value of the FTA with Peru is that we can allow access to the bloc of the Pacific Alliance, which is of interest to Honduras. But we have to work more on the Peruvian market; we will help our entrepreneurs to find business opportunities there. </p><h4>In 2015, Peru's Trade Minister and the Secretary of International Cooperation of Honduras had a meeting in Lima. What areas were identified as those with the greatest potential for cooperation between the two nations?</h4><p>Within the framework of that meeting in Peru in 2015, both parties reaffirmed priorities within the context of our mutual cooperation and the need to further promote dialog spaces for a fruitful exchange of experiences, best practices, and technical assistance, stressing the importance of realizing the Third Joint Commission, in which we will negotiate the following sectors: school meals, handicraft, mining, housing, and MSMEs. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Starting from December 2015, travelers both from Costa Rica and Peru will not require a visa to visit either country. What is the importance of this bilateral agreement and how will it impact Costa Rica's tourism industry?</h4><p>As a result of the realignment of the principal developed source markets for visitors to Costa Rica, the government chose to promote the country as a novel destination in new markets. Costa Rica has selected the largest Latin American countries, whose economies have seen notable growth in recent years, as the focus of this new endeavor. Of those countries, Peru stood out and our government took the decision to eliminate visa fees for Peruvian citizens. This bilateral agreement came into effect in mid-December 2015, and as a result there has been a significant increase in the number of Costa Rican and Peruvian visitors to both countries. From now on, Costa Rica will begin developing a comprehensive promotional campaign through Peruvian media and social networks with the aim of presenting the rich natural attractions of Costa Rica. In addition, these methods should be accompanied by improved facilities for air connections between both countries.</p><h4>What specific segments of the Peruvian economy are particularly appealing for Costa Rica's community of investors?</h4><p>The development of economic and commercial relations between Costa Rica and Peru have, since the implementation of the bilateral Free Trade Agreement in mid-2013, grown considerably. Costa Rican exporters have found a market with an attractive level of sophisticated demand for healthy, value-added food products, as well as sanitary and cleaning products. This has had a significant effect on the positioning of Costa Rican goods directed at the needs and demands of the Peruvian middle class, which enjoys a remarkable purchasing power. In terms of the sectors of the Peruvian economy that are most attractive to Costa Rican investors, the growing presence of Costa Rican companies that have managed to set up a base in Peru should be noted. These Costa Rican investments can be found in sectors as diverse as food, industrial packaging, domestic electronics, and advanced technology.</p><h4>The Pacific Alliance trade bloc creates synergies between leading countries within Latin America. What is the government's strategy to deepen relations with Peru in order to support Costa Rica's access to the Pacific Alliance?</h4><p>One of the consistent pillars of Costa Rica's economic policy is to strive for increased involvement and growth in international commerce. Costa Rica has signed and is part of 14 free trade agreements, and these cover the majority of its commercial members, out of which agreements with four member countries of the Pacific Alliance stand out. Costa Rica aims to deepen its connection with the group, with the aim of strengthening its relations with its member countries and particularly in order to develop a strong policy with regard to the countries of the Asia Pacific. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Bilateral trade between Peru and Mexico has reached more than USD2 billion. How has the Pacific Alliance helped promote trade between the two countries?</h4><p>In recent years, Mexico has become one of Peru's major trading partners. In 2010, we were Peru's 13th-largest trading partner, while in 2014 Mexico was the ninth-largest trade partner. Through the first half of 2016, we have become the eighth-largest trading partner for Peru. Between 2001 and 2014, Mexico's trade with Peru increased ninefold, from USD314 million to USD2.836 billion. The growing trend of bilateral trade responds largely to investments by Mexican companies in Peru and has been strengthened by the Trade Integration Agreement between Mexico and Peru and the Pacific Alliance. In addition, with the Pacific Alliance we eliminated customs tariffs on 92% of our products, and we are heading toward their complete elimination by 2030. In addition, we have conducted several meetings not only with officials, but also with businessmen of the bloc to promote trade and bilateral investment.</p><h4>What are the specific segments of the Peruvian economy that are particularly attractive to Mexican investors?</h4><p>Peru is a sister nation in solidarity with Mexico, and together we have strengthened the mechanisms of cooperation for our mutual economic and social benefit. Based on our bilateral trade agreement and, above all, being part of the Pacific Alliance, we have found promising sectors for trade and mutual investment. In particular, the Peruvian metalworking industry is highly attractive for Mexican companies. We can also see that the metals industry is interesting, especially steel operations. The service sector is another area of particular interest, as the experience of Mexican companies shows the significant growth potential for service providers. On the other hand, Mexican companies from sectors such as mining, telecommunications, processed food, entertainment, education, infrastructure, petrochemicals, and telecommunications have also found a strategic partner in Peru.</p><h4>How do you foresee future bilateral relations between both countries?</h4><p>Peru and Mexico share many particular traits, as well as deep historical and cultural affinities. These elements encourage and stimulate understanding and bilateral dialogue between our countries, which is why I am convinced that the relationship will be enriched by the growing trade volumes and structural reforms that my government has launched, increasing Mexican investments in Peru's tourism, academic, and technological sectors, and cultural exchanges. The understanding between Peru and Mexico will continue to bear fruit thanks to instruments of cooperation on important issues such as culture, education, and tourism, all framed within the Strategic Partnership Agreement, which entered into force in June 2015. In addition, we continue to strengthen our relationship in terms of safety thanks to the agreement of exchange of experience and training in the field. Ours is an even stronger relationship, because we have not yet tapped the full potential of our Trade Integration Agreement, and that of our society in the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP). Both of these, along with the Pacific Alliance, will help to increase trade and investment flows in both directions while encouraging the productive integration of our economies. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>For the bicentennial of our independence, which will take place in 2021, it is my task that we might be able to fulfill the dreams of the founders of our republic. Yes to peace, and yes to union. No to confrontation, and no to division.</p><p>What is the dream that became the promise of life in our republic? Freedom and independence from foreign powers to construct a prosperous country under the rule of law; equality, equity, and brotherhood among Peruvians; access to opportunities; growth, not only economic, but human, through a magnificent education; healthcare that is sensitive to the needs of people; timely and predictable justice; and security in our streets and homes.</p><p>I want a social revolution for my country. In five years, I hope that Peru will be a modern country—more just, more equitable, and more unified. What does this mean? It means that the inequalities between the poor and the rich should be reduced by increasing the incomes of the poorest.</p><p>How can we achieve that? We need to ensure equal access to essential services, which are scarce or nonexistent today, and therefore extremely expensive for the poorest in society. We will close the gaps in access to health and social security and making the wellbeing of people the fundamental objective of any change or reform. We also need to promote complementarity between the public and private sectors and connect ourselves using modern technology.</p><p>Being a modern country means being a country that is honest and not corrupt. What does it mean to be a country without corruption? First, it means recovering a significant amount of money for our shared budget. However, it also means establishing an agenda of priorities based on common interest and not on bribery.<br>Being a modern country means having equality of opportunities for both genders. This means unconditional respect for the dignity of women and their rights, equal pay for equal work, and integrated political participation in the decisions of the government.</p><p>For 2021, the year of the bicentennial, we will have built development infrastructure the likes of which would have never been expected in Peru. We will have much more construction, expansion, and modernization of airports, ports, highways, trains, and gas pipelines. However, these projects are sometimes held up by bureaucratic problems that we need to solve in the next six months. In the same manner, we are going to eliminate many of the obstacles to private investment that Peru awaits with open arms. We will regulate and require compliance with all environmental regulations and we will listen to and respect the opinions of all citizens with regards to the impact of these projects.</p><p>Still, we will seek to persuade and explain, including with my own presence, community by community, the costs and benefits that investment in the extractive industries brings in terms of jobs and tax income for the good of the country.</p><p>For 2021, we will pay fewer taxes, but take in more revenue. Our plan for the formalization of the country will open the doors to all, above all small businesses, which are the vast majority of the Peruvian economy, with terms to provide access to benefits that they do not have today. </p><p>It is not only illegal; it is profoundly unjust that millions of hard-working Peruvians do not have access to even social security or quality healthcare. I know it is difficult to formalize the economy, but we have a plan to do it piece by piece.</p><p>By the end of my term, at least 60% of jobs, instead of the 30% we have today, will be formalized. I know that this will be a difficult commitment to fulfill, but we will begin by reducing sales tax by 1% from 2017 with a special tax scheme for SMEs that formalize themselves. I want informal businesses to understand that we are doing this to put ourselves on the road to prosperity. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have relations between China and Malaysia advanced in recent years?</h4><p>The world is in an era of turbulent transition. Much of the conventional wisdom of the previous century is being challenged in the new world that is emerging in this 21st century. The Brexit vote in the UK and the election of Donald Trump to the US presidency are but two examples. Added to that are shifting geopolitical interests and alliances, plus the unsettling and unpredictable economic upheavals. It is therefore pleasing to note that amidst this rather troubled global context, ASEAN and China are demonstrating what can be achieved through a strengthening of mutually-beneficial economic, trade, and diplomatic relations. Within ASEAN, China is Malaysia's largest trading partner and has been since 2009. Bilateral trade exceeds USD100 billion, with both governments committed to a target of USD160 billion in total trade by 2017. In a sign of the deepening economic relations between our two countries, ties are being established not just at the national level, but also at the state and provincial levels. One example is the signing of the MoU between the Melaka state government and the Guangdong provincial government in 2015.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the “One Belt, One Road" initiative?</h4><p>China is now ASEAN's largest trading partner and ASEAN is China's third-largest trading partner. But I believe the prospects are bright for the economic relationship to grow even bigger. One reason for my confidence is the One Belt, One Road initiative, mooted by President Xi Jinping. The economic potential of this initiative that connects Asia, Africa, and Europe is immense. It encompasses 65 countries with a combined population of 4.4 billion people, more than half the population of the planet. In 2014, China's annual trade with countries along the “One Belt, One Road" route exceeded USD1.1 trillion. The initiative fits well with what is happening in our own region in Southeast Asia. In January, the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) came into effect. The AEC seeks to create a single market and production base in the region. When fully implemented, the AEC will deepen the economic integration of ASEAN's 10 member states through a seamless, cross-border trading and investment regime. As a single entity, ASEAN is currently the seventh-largest economy in the world, home to a consumer market of more than 620 million people with a combined gross domestic product estimated at more than USD2.5 trillion. By 2020, ASEAN aims to become the fifth largest economy in the world, with a GDP expected and projected to almost double to USD4.7 trillion. The AEC and the One Belt, One Road project will clearly provide a major boost to China-ASEAN bilateral trade.</p><h4>What are the major takeaways from the World Chinese Economic Summit (WCES) in this regard?</h4><p>The WCES has become a successful and institutionalized international platform to promote the One Belt, One Road initiative, as well as to foster closer China-ASEAN relations and connectivity with the global Chinese diaspora. In fact, this year's summit in Malacca carries a special historic significance, as it was here where Admiral Zheng arrived more than 600 years ago when he first sailed from China, marking the beginning of the Maritime Silk Road. Now here we all are, working together to create a 21st century version of that original sea corridor. We believe WCES will provide a timely opportunity to assess the challenges and opportunities in the One Belt, One Road initiative. We seek to provide the platform for the best minds to share knowledge and experience, and I am confident that the WCES can play a major role in shaping the future of our region and ASEAN's relationship with China. A mutually-beneficial China-ASEAN relationship is vital for regional peace, stability, and prosperity. As this year marks the 25th anniversary of China-ASEAN relations, let us strive to further enhance our bilateral relations to derive maximum benefits for all sides. It is my belief that we can deepen ASEAN-China relations by focusing on the 4Es—economic cooperation, education partnership, energy security, and environmental sustainability. The WCES is not about politics, but about business, friendship, culture, and education.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The year 2017 marks your fifth as head of Terpel. What have been the major milestones achieved during this period?</h4><p>Without any doubt, the successful implementation of our competitive strategy in service stations. Having been, for several years, the leading company of the downstream sector in Colombia, in 2012 we challenged the status quo and decided to make a shift in our competitive strategy: we decided that Terpel, with its affiliates, would focus on the people that came to our service stations rather than only on their vehicles. Under the certainty that we were delivering the best quality in our products, we focused our innovation around the individuals that visit the Terpel network all over the country. In accordance to this shift in strategy, we changed our logo and made substantial improvements in aspects related to service levels, infrastructure, and pricing to become the best choice for our final customers. As a result we offer competitive prices in each market, and are changing the architectural design of our stations, renovating the bathroom facilities, and, among other things, building innovative convenience stores. And when I say innovative, I mean stores that cannot be compared to generic convenience stores you see around the world; they are different in many respects of which the most important are the outstanding bathroom facilities and the differentiation we are making in the food we offer according to the region the station is located in. In Colombia, one of the main characteristics that differs from region to region is the local food. Terpel wants to acknowledge this difference and satisfy the different tastes and the variety of products available in our country. This leads me to the importance of all the people who work with us to serve our customers. We are constantly training and motivating teams in giving the most memorable experiences we can throughout our network in order to be the Top of Heart brand for every citizen we serve. These imply making a lot of changes to consolidate a service culture throughout every one of us. In this aspect in particular, it is important to know that 90% of Terpel's network is comprised of service stations that are not owned by the company, but by affiliates (franchisees) to the brand. In order to have a homogeneous experience for customers, we have been working together with these franchise holders to exchange knowledge and expertise so we can deliver a better experience to our customers as a whole. We have marvelous service station owners who exceed all the standards for our strategy. Service stations are the same all over the world (normally, the only thing that changes is the color of their canopies) and thanks to this shift in strategy, we can proudly say that Terpel is the exception. In accordance to our focus on persons, Terpel is also innovating to better serve certain groups of customers. Motorcyclists, for example, who drive more than half of the vehicles in Colombia, have become one of our major challenges and have been the inspiration for new services and infrastructure. This is the most important thing: our people-based strategy has been the driver of our decisions in the last five years.</p><h4>What are Terpel's strategies regarding further expansion or diversification?</h4><p>We have a long way to go in Colombia. Many people thought we had expanded outside Colombia because the Colombian market was already mature, but we do not think so. Aside from service stations, were we are still developing a market, we also have industrial, aviation, and lubricants businesses; hence, we have a lot still to do in Colombia. Of course, Colombia's market is the biggest and most mature in the region. We are also operating in Panama which is the second biggest network for Terpel and the one with the highest rates of growth and a great potential. In service stations, we have also big challenges in Ecuador, Peru, and Mexico. Over the past two countries, our main service is vehicle natural gas stations where we foresee a great opportunity in the world's transition to cleaner energies. The Dominican Republic was the first country where we began our operations through the fuel supply of airports. We have had a very good experience and hope to keep expanding our services.</p><h4>How much impact do you think a peace deal will have on foreign investor interest in the energy sector in Colombia?</h4><p>It is out of the question that a peaceful country is a better investment decision than one which encompasses the risk of a civil war. However, people have been investing in Colombia for many years now and the frightening country we used to acknowledge 10 or 15 years ago, is long gone. A successful military strategy along with various peace outreaches have led to a feasible country where investment and business have flourished even in the presence of scattered, yet pitiful, terrorist attacks. However, having said that, I do believe that there are many places in Colombia, mainly rural areas, where peace will bring feasibility or higher returns to many projects mainly in oil, tourism, and agriculture.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the sector?</h4><p>I believe we have a lot of competition, which is good for the country. There are 18 major companies competing in Colombia, as well as a great many service stations (near 5,000); the latter are growing in number by nearly a hundred each year. This is a good level of competition for consumers. We have been better off in terms of the security environment, which helps. This is a highly regulated sector and we hope this will change, as it is difficult to be efficient when too much regulation is in place. With so many players, competition is assured and heavy regulation is no longer needed, from my point of view, in the market. Consumers would be better served if companies were able to be more efficient. I see a competitive sector and one that is moving toward deregulation.</p><h4>What are your thoughts on the role of women in the energy sector in Colombia and the challenges they face?</h4><p>The world is moving towards becoming a more inclusive professional environment. However, I do believe that there is still a lot to be done in every sector, but particularly in this one, where it is hard to find a woman in leading posts, to increase women's participation. Men and women can complement each other's capacities and vision to make companies better places to work and to make teams better qualified to make successful and sustainable decisions. This is a challenge that we all should engage with, in order to socially and economically advance at a quicker pace. In Terpel, for example, in our dream of becoming the leading brand for the people, complementing both visions and perspectives, have been of a great value for the team and I believe this has lead to great ideas for our customers which would have been very difficult to achieve without this mix of genders. It is great to have both visions in one integrated professional team. We welcome everyone to come to Terpel's stations. Our promise is to deliver a different and unique service experience.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Intel Costa Rica hosts the largest research and development center in the country. How does it contribute to the country's socioeconomic development?</h4><p>In terms of economic development, when you look at the history of our presence and our original role as a manufacturer, and then you look at the broader sphere of manufacturing, you really see the extent to which the country evolved in tandem with us. Many other new companies followed suit. Today, Intel Costa has more than 2,000 Costa Rican direct employees. However, if you look at the overall effect on the economy, you see there are thousands of additional jobs being created by this presence. There are a lot more engineers and finance and HR professionals, not to mention the whole support ecosystem that builds up around that. Socially, we are conscious of the way the country has been transformed and spend a lot of our time in the math and science fields where we are working with grade schools and at the university level to increase those engineering programs. If you are going to innovate then you need more engineers, and we are working to do that in partnership with the country. There is a lot that we are trying to make happen.</p><h4>The main advantage of Costa Rica is its workforce, which still suffers from a lack of professional in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math). How is Intel working with educational institutions to resolve this?</h4><p>We have actually been partnering with seven different private and public universities in the disciplines needed to prepare our youth for the future of the global economy. We have worked together on curriculum and what kind of electives could fit skill sets needed for the new economy. So far, it has been successful. We are working with private universities because half the student population is graduating from them.</p><h4>The 'Intel effect' refers to a slowdown in the economy after Intel moved its manufacturing operations from Costa Rica to Asia in 2014. What was this process like and in which areas are you investing the most?</h4><p>A few things happened afterwards. We first announced a Mega Lab, which the president inaugurated. That was the start of something that showed people that Intel was going to continue investing in the country. People were seeing many engineering teams showing up, not to mention all the jobs provided by the lab itself. We had factory engineers that wound up getting new skills and creating new careers in other engineering fields. Though originally only slated to have 1,200 people, within six months there were 1,600. Every quarter, I would come back and show our employees the growth, so that over time I was able to convey a message with data that showed what was happening was real. Recently, I have been showing people a chart of how we looked two years ago and what we look like today. We made the decision then to be a part of the list of companies that were certified as Essential Costa Rica. Second, we recently had nine vice presidents of Intel Corporation here at Intel Costa Rica, which does not normally happen at any other site. Those are signs of our commitment and confidence in Costa Rica and our broader efforts to bring the country closer to having a knowledge-based economy.</p><h4>Intel is a seven-time winner of the Community Service Award from the Costa Rican American Chamber of Commerce (AMCHAM). Social and environmental responsibility is key to your global operations. What are some highlights of those initiatives?</h4><p>We are active at the grade school level, in particular by helping in math, science, and technology. We also conduct other activities that make Costa Rica look better from an overall perspective, including both environmental activities and economic innovation-related activities that seek to partner with other companies in doing community service to relieve the country's social problems. The range of these is pretty wide, but can be defined by three pillars: the environment, community, and education. Therefore, we changed the focus of our CSR several years ago; from traditional volunteering (painting schools or cleaning rivers etc), we decided to switch to more knowledge-based volunteering that gives back to the community based on the abilities, skills, and knowledge that our people have. This includes making an impact on science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). If the country wants to be developed, is necessary to invest in STEM areas. Hence, working with elementary and high schools and universities and letting kids understand why it is cool to be an engineer is part of what we are doing with the community. If you look at the statistics, you will find that most people without jobs are studying or have studied topics that are unrelated to science, technology, engineering, or math. Only 6% of students currently graduate with engineering degrees. Intel can help by going around and sharing our story to male and female engineers and showing kids why being an engineer can be cool and is a fulfilling way to spend one's life.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>RAK is experiencing strong growth both in the tourism and manufacturing/industrial sectors, driven by significant levels of foreign investment. What are the key factors that make RAK an attractive destination for foreign capital?</h4><p>First and foremost, Ras Al Khaimah has a long history of both political stability and social harmony, accompanied by a track record of policy consistency guided by the principles of economic openness, modernization, and diversification. These are vital because they provide fundamental building blocks for development and prosperity, and are the first things foreign investors examine when they choose a location for their business. We continue to build upon these intrinsic strengths of the Emirate by offering an attractive investor-friendly environment with rule of law, no taxes, and an easily navigable administrative system. The World Bank Doing Business study, published in October 2016, ranked the UAE the 26th most business friendly place in the world out of 190 countries surveyed, well ahead of all other GCC countries. This is a testimony to the success of our ongoing efforts to create the best physical and legal infrastructure for industries of all kinds to thrive in this Emirate.</p><h4>Looking ahead, from where do you see potential future FDI into RAK coming?</h4><p><span></span>Given our geographical location and fundamental institutional strengths we are uniquely positioned to take advantage of investment inflows from the advanced economies of Europe, US, Japan, the Republic of Korea, as well as from emerging markets in Africa. We continue to diversify the economy, and are conscious of the necessity of having a diversified pool of investors. From our point of view, Asia is under-represented in the Emirate and through more highly targeted awareness campaigns we can attract more firms from Japan, China, and the Republic of Korea.</p><h4>There is a high ratio of expatriate workforce in all major sectors of RAK's economy. How does the Emirate ensure that young Emiratis are given the opportunity to engage in RAK's economic growth?</h4><p><span></span>RAK's economic growth and development is all-inclusive, but at the same time we pay close attention to the needs and conditions of our young population. Education is the key element of our strategy to empower local young people. We have several programs aimed at developing entrepreneurship and raising the level of technical skills, which complements our initiative to develop SMEs. Over the past ten years a number of educational institutions have been established here, such as AURAK and RAKMHSU, and having these institutions here enables local students to obtain tertiary education in a number of disciplines at an affordable price without having to leave the Emirate.</p><h4>The rating agencies give RAK an 'A' level with a 'stable' outlook. From RAK's perspective, which fundamentals need to be focused on for a higher rating?</h4><p><span></span>The sovereign rating assigned to us by Fitch Ratings and S&amp;P give due recognition to our many credit strengths; political stability, ease of doing business, track record of fiscal prudence, and a low and declining debt and interest burden. Where we need to improve is in the provision of macroeconomic data needed for economic analysis and forecasting. This coincides with the UAE's push for more accurate and wide-ranging work on big data. We need to be able to provide robust and credible statistics about the Emirate, and to do that we need to overcome some institutional deficiencies in our data gathering and analysis. We are well on the way to accomplishing that with the establishment in July 2016 of the RAK Statistics and Studies Center. To strengthen our statistical capability, we also need to improve governance, especially as it pertains to the management of state owned enterprises (SOEs). We have a large number of SOEs, which provide the majority of the Emirate's revenues, and we need to improve policies, processes, and transparency in order to have better oversight over these entities and expand their level of efficiency.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What efforts is the current administration taking to improve the investment climate and promote employment creation?</h4><p><span></span>The country's economic growth is based upon the strengthening of institutions, infrastructure development, macroeconomic stability, and the development of our human capital. This is why our efforts have been focused on these four essential pillars to develop the basis of the second part of our program. To do so, we launched the 20/20 Honduras Project, which aims to improve the business climate, while focusing on the development of the following areas: agribusiness, textiles, business services (call centers), tourism, intermediate manufacturing, and housing. Taken together, we hope this initiative will generate 600,000 jobs, attract investment worth USD13 billion, and boost exports. These six economic sectors are where the Honduran economy really has the potential to take off and generate enough jobs to meet the needs of the population. We already have a solid growth of 3.6% of GDP, but we think we can reach more with the implementation of the 20/20 Honduras Project. We are also organizing a scholarship system that will allow us to train and develop our human resources with priority given to areas related to the 20/20 Honduras Project.</p><h4>How will the government increase the country's competitiveness inside and outside the region?</h4><p><span></span>The elements for increasing our competitiveness all lie within the four previously mentioned pillars. In the short term, investment in infrastructure will be one of the most important elements because it will turn Honduras into a logistics corridor for all of Central America. To do so, we are building a series of corridors and improving port facilities in the Caribbean and the Gulf of Fonseca, which gives us access to the Pacific Ocean. We also have a plentiful and potentially well-qualified workforce that has already shown its strength in the maquila manufacturing industry and in rendering various business services. Furthermore, we have made important changes in the electricity sector. Since our energy production is increasingly based on renewable sources, foreign investors can be confident  that their production does not jeopardize the environment. Finally, we have made various legislative advances that enhance foreign investors' legal protections, not to mention improved our competitiveness, both of which are reflected in our international rankings. For example, we moved up 23 places in the World Economic Forum's global rankings from 111th in 2014 to 88th in 2016. We know this is a difficult and long-term process, but our goal is to continue moving forward and make the country more competitive.</p><h4>With nearly USD1 billion in bilateral trade, Mexico is Honduras' fourth largest trading partner. How important is this economic relationship?</h4><p><span></span>Mexico is not only an important trading partner but also a prominent investor in our country. With trade of approximately USD$1 billion and hopefully rising, I hope these ties will strengthen and continue to generate more jobs in both countries. I also hope our FTA remains in place and that we can continue to expand our commercial ties with our Northern partner. Both countries have opportunities to grow even more, as trading partners, because of our proximity, shared cultural values, and common identity. </p><h4>How would you rate the importance of the Mexico-Central America gas pipeline for Honduras?</h4><p><span></span>This is an important project not only for Honduras but for all of Central America. Undoubtedly, having an alternative energy source at competitive prices is important to improve the competitiveness of our economy. It also gives Mexico permanent and reliable clients within its natural sphere of influence. We must remember that the relationship between Mexico and Honduras dates to pre-Colombian times. Thus, the gas pipeline is important for the region, as it would generate an energy zone between Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and, hopefully, El Salvador. It will be a multi-million dollar investment that would benefit the entire region.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the importance of the role performed by Mexican private sector investors in the Honduran economy?</h4><p><span></span>Mexican investors have been and currently are the number one foreign investors in Honduras. Nonetheless, we are always looking for more Mexican investment in Honduras, which is why I recently made two visits to a couple of Mexican states to encourage them to come, invest, and settle in Honduras. As a result of these visits, an increasing number of delegations from governors and business leaders are coming here. Seeing our attractive business agenda, we can only hope that more will do so in the near future. I am convinced that the arrival of Mexican companies would not only benefit Honduras for employment creation, but Mexico as well.</p><h4>Compared to 2014, Foreign Direct Investment in Honduras grew by 5.2% in 2015. Which economic sectors are most attractive for Mexican investors and which have the greatest potential for growth?</h4><p><span></span>Our economy is growing steadily in most of the key economic sectors, especially telecommunications, energy, finance, and construction. While these four have the potential to continue growing even more, we also need to incentivize labor-intensive sectors that generate employment, since the aforementioned sectors, with the exception of construction, do not generate mass employment. Nonetheless, it is important to highlight that we will continue promoting these sectors, as they are essential pillars for fostering the productivity and growth of other sectors, and can help strengthen this country's total productive capacities. There is a plan underway in the construction sector to invest more than USD2 billion, with which we will lay the foundations of economic expansion and the creation of thousands of jobs.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-good-fight]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You recently spoke at the symposium about the best way to fund and sustain anti-corruption efforts in Nigeria. What are the main initiatives taken by the government to tackle corruption in the country?</h4><p><span></span>The war against corruption is one of the three focal areas we identified immediately during the campaigns. The other two are securing the country and reviving the economy, particularly with respect to job creation. We have done our level best to keep our promises. We have tackled insecurity head-on and the successes are evident. We also have all hands on deck to retune the economy and have no doubt that the efforts will yield positive results. In terms of our initiatives to fight corruption, there is the imperative of personal example. If we want to wage the war successfully, we must strive to be aboveboard ourselves. If we are corrupt personally, whatever rhetoric we talk about corruption will sound hollow. We strive to be as transparent as possible in our dealings. Again, we have ensured that every proven case of corruption is prosecuted, no matter who is involved. There are no sacred cows. Anyone who has questions to answer must answer them. Equally, in prosecuting a successful corruption war, the anti-graft agencies must have free hands. And that is what we have done. We do not remotely guide them in any way or breathe down their necks. Rather, we empower them to discharge their duties, and we maintain a critical distance. The anti-corruption war is crucial to us. There will be no let up. It is a promise we made, which we are fulfilling, and which we must fulfill to the letter.</p><h4>The World Bank's Ease of Doing Business index places Nigeria in 169th place out of 189 countries. What is the federal government's strategy to rise to the top 100 before 2020?</h4><p><span></span>We ensure that we make doing business in Nigeria as easy as possible. Bureaucratic bottlenecks are being dismantled, red tape is being taken out of the way, and results are being achieved faster. If we compare Nigeria's standings in the Ease of Doing Business a year ago with where we are today, the difference is clear. And things will get much better.</p><h4>What will be main strategies of the government to diversify the economy? What sectors are of highest priority?</h4><p><span></span>We are determined to diversify the Nigerian economy away from oil. Unfortunately, we have turned ourselves into a single-product economy by depending on oil alone, so when oil prices crashed in 2015, we also crashed along with it. But we have refused to stay down. We have identified viable alternatives for our economy. One is agriculture. We are blessed with vast tracts of arable land around the country and can grow all that we need to eat, attain food sufficiency, and also begin to export. For instance, we spend about USD2 billion to import rice yearly. However, we can also grow rice in many parts of the country. The Central Bank of Nigeria has arranged funds for rice farmers, and in another year or two, we may stop importing the product completely. That will free foreign exchange for other developmental projects. Farmers are also being helped to cultivate other products such as maize, sorghum, millet, cassava, and many others. Another area of diversification is mine and steel development. Nigeria is blessed with rich mineral deposits, which have been fallow over the decades. Now, we are determined to tap them for the benefit of our people. We are laying a foundation that will bring handsome revenues into the coffers of government in years to come. We are also paying attention to manufacturing and will develop tourism. Every area that can shore up our income will be attended to. It does not mean we will abandon oil, however. God has blessed us with oil, but we will no longer depend on it solely, since we have so much other potential.</p><h4>What role does the government play to facilitate foreign direct investment in the country? How can you ensure that those investments translate into maximum benefits for Nigerians?</h4><p><span></span>We facilitate FDI through our programs and policies. Investors will not come into a situation ridden with corrupt practices. So, we are fighting corruption to a standstill. They will also not come into an insecure environment. We battle insecurity across the country. We cannot manage a country until we have effectively secured it. We also are working on the Ease of Doing Business, so that more foreign direct investment can come in. We also offer tax holidays and other kinds of incentives.</p><h4>What role does the National Economic Council (NEC) play in the socioeconomic development of the country?</h4><p><span></span>The National Economic Council articulates our economic policy and direction, and also keeps an eye on it. We met a troubled economy when we came in 2015. In fact, the foundation for recession had been laid. But we are working sure-footedly to lay a new foundation for the Nigerian economy. We will get there.</p><h4>What legacy would this administration like to leave in the country?</h4><p><span></span>The legacy I want to leave is that of a country where corruption is reduced to the barest minimum, if not completely eradicated. I want to bequeath a country that Nigerians are proud of, safe, secure, and prosperous.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[recovery-position]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong></p><h4>What are IFC's most recent projects that have the largest impact on the country's long-term development?</h4><p>IFC is the largest global development institution focused exclusively on the private sector. In this context, IFC in the last few years has invested over a billion dollars in Kazakhstan. If we speak about specific sectors, much of our work has been done in the financial sector. We are supporting the development of the sector by making investments and strengthening financial institutions to help them expand access to finance for small and medium enterprise (SMEs) and entrepreneurs. IFC supported Eastcomtrans with long-term financing to help expand its railcar fleet, broadening commercial logistics services and helping develop the country's infrastructure for trade and industry. It also supported Jambyl Cement in the construction of a greenfield, state-of-the-art dry-process cement plant, as well as the Ust-Kamenogorsk Poultry plant to expand production and improve the bio-security of its operations and many other companies. For the country's infrastructure, IFC advises the Ministry of Investment and Development to structure and implement an international tender for the Big Almaty Ring Motor Road (BAKAD). This situation, the first of its kind, is considered a market maker for future public-private projects (PPP) in the region. The project is part of the Western China-Western Europe International Corridor, where Kazakhstan is a key piece within the “Silk Road." However, if you set aside these larger projects, there are many other small projects, for example microfinance initiatives that target the poorest in society. They may not be large loans, USD5-15 million, but they reach a large amount of households. For example, we provided funding through microfinancing institutions to a seamstress who makes Kazakh national dresses. Going forward, we see infrastructure, agribusiness, energy and resource efficiency, and financial and capital markets as key sectors for private investments in Kazakhstan. We also see great potential for broader use of PPPs and support the country's privatization program.</p><h4>Many countries try to diversify away from oil and gas. When prices go up again, how challenging is it to focus away from the energy sector?</h4><p>At times these crisis periods are good because they serve as wake-up calls, this is the time to reform. In theory governments should implement reforms when the economy is doing well, because they have necessary funds for them though that never happens. An area that we support the government is increasing the private sector involvement in the economy. Kazakhstan is very much dominated by the public sector and the private sector's role is limited to providing money to the government to support the budget. This needs a balance. We need the private sector for a number of reason. First of all for jobs creation as Kazakhstan is facing a growing population and needs more jobs. Around the world, SMEs create between 60-80% of jobs in any economy. In Kazakhstan, this is low, at about 30% or so. Moreover, SMEs in Kazakhstan grow more slowly than both larger firms in Kazakhstan and SMEs in comparable countries. While Kazakhstan is believed to have a large number of “latent entrepreneurs," the share of startup firms remains relatively low, and few firms transition from small to medium size, or from medium to large. Barriers such as geography, local market size, informality, corruption, high administrative costs, inadequate access to finance, and a lack of professional and managerial skills all inhibit the formation and growth of SMEs. The dominant role of SOEs in a number of markets is also a major barrier to the entry and growth of smaller firms and to the overall development of the private sector. The public sector cannot keep employing people and filling ministries and state enterprises with more people. The government needs to increase the role of the private sector and focus on SMEs. The privatization program is clearly designed for this and the question is how it is going to be done and how the regulation will work. For the success of the privatization effort, attracting the right investors will be critical. The uncertain global economic environment in general, and the collapse of global oil prices in particular, have reduced the attractiveness of many middle-income countries to international investors, and Kazakhstan is no exception. The challenges of privatization may be exacerbated by the specific terms of the privatization process. For instance, a number of important SOEs are slated for partial privatization, with the government retailing an ownership share of 75% or more, which may diminish their appeal to investors. Moreover, the initial public offering approach has not proven successful in Kazakhstan in the past. In addition, a successful privatization effort will require a transparent, technically sound and fair process for screening investors and evaluating bids. Since employment is and should be a goal for any government, successful privatizations require that the social contract between the government and society is maintained. If there are concerns about people losing jobs as a result of the privatization program, there is a need to put in place program which allow redundant employees to gain new skills through retraining programs, outsourcing opportunities, and provision of SME services. A privatization process might reduce employment rates in the beginning, but employment actually goes up later because as companies expand their operations they require more people.</p><h4>Many sectors in Kazakhstan, for example agriculture, have low penetration rates. What is your view on its investment potential?</h4><p>Agriculture has huge potential indeed. Kazakhstan has the fifth-largest amount of arable land in the world and, in terms of availability of new land, it probably stands at number one. It is also located in a region with about 3 billion people within few hours of flying distances China, India, and Iran. This huge population is become affluent due to sustained high economic growth rates experienced in their countries over many years and this population has changing preferences as the incomes have arisen. The most notable change has been a gradual shift away from vegetable-based diets toward protein-rich diet (meat). Also there is a modern trend toward organic production. It takes about 7 kg of feed to produce 1 kg of beef. The feed which is mostly grain based requires good land. And here Kazakhstan has the advantage. Kazakhstan has no limitation on land. It can even focus on organic production that many countries do not have the luxury to produce because it requires a certain amount of hectares per animal. Therefore, Kazakhstan has tremendous potential in agribusiness. However, there are hardly any international investors there. There has been a focus on grain in the past, dominated by Kazakh companies financed mainly by KazAgro or else privately. Their finances are not in a shape to receive more money at the moment. There is clearly an issue of how these companies have been financed in the past and whether they can get new credit. Other areas that investors should focus on are fruits and vegetables and livestock. We need to get the right investors into Kazakhstan's agribusiness with the right technology, as the agriculture business has become technical.</p><h4>The National Bank currently is currently focused on bringing inflation down from double-digit figures to a 6-7% target. How do you welcome the bank's current monetary policy of keeping interest rates unchanged?</h4><p>The base bank rate today is between 12-14%. This rates seems high but in fact it gives a negative real yield given today's inflation level. Nevertheless it's considered high as it hinders creation of new credit. By the time lenders add their margins to the base rate, the available credit rates turn into 16-18% range. The demand for credit is thus low and businesses are postponing borrowing decisions. The National Bank has made a shift in its monetary policy toward inflation-targeting which leads to the tenge rate being adjusted by the market. The idea is to restore the credibility of the monetary policy after large devaluations of the currency over the past year. However, Kazakhstan faces a huge challenge in this respect. Extensive dollarization in the economy, with more than 65% of bank deposits in foreign currency, limits the effectiveness of monetary policy. Clearly this issue needs to be tackled. To stabilize the banking system, the government plans as medium term measures to further develop non-cash payments, reduce turnover in lightly-regulated shadow banks, and ban foreign currency pricing. To achieve stability in the long run, the government will try to accelerate economic diversification and increase the local content of goods and services as far as possible under World Trade Organization (WTO) regulations.</p><h4>What are your predictions about the opportunities and challenges Kazakhstan will face during its recovery in the next few years?</h4><p>There is some good news and some new challenges. The good news is that oil prices have stabilized, and that is good for Kazakhstan. In the immediate future, this will help the country build its reserves and take the pressure off the government budget, allowing it to spend more. Increased spending would mean more economic activity, and therefore higher growth rates. This is an opportunity for the country to reform and the challenge would be to keep the ship steady and maintain the policy for change. As oil prices go back up, there will be a temptation not to undertake difficult economic reforms and make it more efficient and resilient. The government should pursue the economic diversification it has planned. Central to sustained improvements in productivity are the strengthening of the business climate, greater room for private sector expansion in an environment of neutral incentives, and progress on the governance agenda. A well-functioning financial sector and improved access to finance remains an important element of the growth and diversification agenda. An important challenge is further development of the credit infrastructure—pledge and real estate registries, microfinance, factoring, leasing and venture capital—and the deepening of local currency bond markets so that multiple sources of financing for the private sector at competitive prices can be developed. Trade integration policies will affect prospects. The development of infrastructure to position the country as a regional transit hub, the development of Caspian Sea ports and railroads, and the development of aviation will further assist productivity growth outside oil.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of EnerTech's biggest milestones?</h4><p>EnerTech was established in 2001 as a department at the NTEC. In 2010, NTEC developed a new strategy to spin off the department and, consequently, established EnerTech in 2012. We invest globally in the IP of these technologies and all the clean-tech space that includes energy efficiencies and renewables, oil and gas in niche markets, and water technologies. Then we would transfer technology to Kuwait or the region. By partnering with companies, we primarily provide manufacturing facilities and marketing offices. We are building vehicles to help the technologies to come to the region. This was our main focus at the time and we have been successful building several platforms. In early 2013, we developed a company that can develop, operate, and commission renewable products in Dubai. In contrast to the UAE, Kuwait does not have an established legal framework for venture capital. For example, shareholders in Kuwait do not recognize venture capital terms like tag along and requisition preferences. If anything goes wrong then it goes to the articles of associations. Even foreign investors are not comfortable working in Kuwait, so it was easy for us to establish in Dubai. The point here is to serve the GCC region so eventually the work is done in Kuwait anyways. We were able to develop several projects in Africa, the Middle East, and, most successfully, in Pakistan. In Pakistan, we have a project worth more than USD1 billion in investments in process with the government of Pakistan. This enabled us to further invest in a Canadian technology company called Morgan Solar, which is a unique solar company in the CPV space. EnerTech is therefore known as a developer in the renewable energy segment.</p><h4>How viable is the government's objective to have renewables cover over 15% of overall consumption by 2030?</h4><p>I find it is a very viable and critical objective. Kuwait consumes 10% of the oil to cover its energy requirements. If it continues this to 2030, it is going to consume 1 million barrels to satisfy energy demand. Especially with the development plan as well as housing and infrastructure projects, renewables are becoming critical to adopt as well as energy efficiency. If Kuwait does not adopt energy-efficient policies and renewables, climate change will have a drastic impact. Kuwait's temperature is reaching record highs and the highest temperature in the world was recorded in Kuwait in July 2016. We need to develop an energy efficiency plan and the high consumption behavior has to stop. The temperature cannot be 60 degrees outside and 16 degrees inside homes. We do not want to compromise comfort, but the mentality has to change. For example, we leave lights on all the time in this country. People do not understand that this consumes more energy than to have water running. The government has recently increased the tariff from KD0.002 to KD0.025 to the commercials. This is going to have a huge impact and several companies have already approached us to make them energy efficient. What we offered to the Higher Council of Planning was to install energy-efficiency measures in all government buildings and commercial buildings for free, if we share the savings. This is called an ESCO account and had already been adopted elsewhere like Dubai and Jordan. The Minister of Finance, however, does not have the framework and mechanism to adopt this proposal. We are pushing hard and officially submitted this to the council, but we will see how this is going to evolve.</p><h4>What are the biggest structural challenges in moving the energy efficiency and consumption patterns toward renewables?</h4><p>There is no mechanism and there has to be a new registration allowing the ESCO account. Otherwise, there is no way that it can be done. The Kuwait Foundation for the Advancement of Sciences (KFAS) has now signed an agreement with the Ministry of Electricity (MEW) to develop this mechanism. KFAS built solar parking and now it wants to share its savings with the ministry. Once the technical part is done then MEW will talk to the Ministry of Finance. If KFAS and MEW push hard to force the Ministry of Finance to adopt this mechanism, it will have a huge impact on Kuwait. I can see good indications of adopting energy efficiencies and it is becoming a necessity and something that we have to do. For example, the government has given the Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research (KISR) a 10x15km plot of land to build 2,000MW of renewable energy. The reason for this park is to identify the best technologies and tariff for Kuwait within three years. We submitted an official proposal to build 2,500MW. We will build it and pay for a tariff that is below the cost of the ministry and are willing to give 20% off for Kuwaitis. However, there is no legislation for the PPA and the IPP model that have to be developed. The government has to come up with a tariff and there are two ways to do that. Either there is a competitive bid with multiple companies bidding or we set up a tariff and ask companies to submit a proposal, which is the case of Jordan, Egypt, and Pakistan. The government is not doing anything and relying on KISR to come up with a solution. It is a five-year plan, and we cannot wait. Our goal in 2015 was to achieve 1%, and we did not achieve 1% of the 1%. Because of this governmental structure, there is no one who has authority or mandate to lead the renewable plan. I am still optimistic because of the necessity and losing the income from the oil to secure the energy so they have to move fast. Given that solar prices have also gone extremely low, it has become extremely attractive for governments to adopt. Dubai, Oman, and Jordan have already started and Saudi Arabia has reduced their gigawatts, so we see a move toward renewables in the GCC.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main reasons behind the 26.8% increase in profits between January and June 2016 compared to 2015?</h4><p>We are a government-owned development institution and the acquisition of high yields is not our major goal. As a development bank, our major role is to promote the diversification of the economy in Kazakhstan and implement a new economy industrialization program of the government. On this basis, the indicator that would characterize the contribution of the DBK in this direction is an increase in our loan portfolio through an increase in the financing of sectors other than raw material-based ones, such as processing sectors primarily, which provides for the diversification of the economy. Our consolidated credit portfolio as of August 1, 2016 was KZT1.394 trillion versus KZT843 billion last August. The visible increase is about 65%; however, if you exclude the devaluation effect, the gross increase will be about 20%. For us it is important to finance efficient projects, which is why the second important indicator of the efficiency of our work is the quality of our loan portfolio. As for net profit, it should be noted that steps taken by DBK affected this indicator in some way. This spring we conducted stress testing on all our projects and assessed the volume of credit portfolio is more sensitive to foreign exchange risks. About 15% of our projects seemed to be exposed to this risk and we thus decided to restructure these loan. As a result, we have diverted the financing from foreign exchange to tenge. These measures resulted in good quality of credit portfolio as of current date, excluded formation of any additional provisions and, certainly, had effect on net profit. This is true and valid for the period from August 1, 2015 through to August 1 this year, as the bank has previous history that cannot be described only by these comments.</p><h4>What are some of the bank's ongoing and planned projects that will have the biggest impact on Kazakhstan's economy?</h4><p>There was a standard that the loan amount should be not less than USD20 million, which was then raised to USD30 million, to match the size of Kazakhstan. For the processing sectors of our country such projects are considered large. At present we have 36 investment projects in our portfolio and 11 export loans. This year we took the decision to invest in poultry farm construction in the Akmola region with a capacity of 60,000 tons per year; the construction of a transport logistics center in south Kazakhstan; the construction of the Turgussun hydro power station in east Kazakhstan; the expansion and modernization of a nitrogenous fertilizer plant in west Kazakhstan; and the construction of a sodium cyanide plant in south Kazakhstan. The Development Bank of Kazakhstan (DBK) also invested in a project on the complete production cycle for railway wheels in the Pavlodar region. Also, we continue to finance the modernization of the Atyrau and Pavlodar refineries, and have invested in such greenfield projects as the construction of rail and structural steel plants in the Aktobe region. In whole, 83 new plants have been put into operation using the funds of the DBK.</p><h4>What sectors would you advise local and international investors to invest in?</h4><p>In my opinion agribusiness is a sector that is gaining significant impetus and is a promising sector. Our government is actively negotiating with China to export agriculture products to the market there. The middle class is growing in China and it is keen to have environmentally friendly products. Kazakh products are synonymous with being environmentally safe and ecological. At present the Chinese are ready to import products such as grain, meat, and vegetable oils from Kazakhstan. China is a new market for our agricultural products. But if we speak about traditional markets, then the creation of the Eurasian Union with the markets of Russia and Belarus, and Kyrgyzstan and Armenia, which recently joined, provides us with a wide market for the supply of our agriculture products. DBK is also interested in green energy, such as wind and solar energy projects. However, according to the estimates of the relevant ministry the overall relative weight of green energy in the power industry shall be limited for sustainable power supply and consumption. Traditional sources of energy will prevail. That is why there are opportunities for investment in green energy, but such opportunities will be afforded to enterprises that propose the best conditions and more effective projects, as limits on the production of non-conventional energy will be determined on a competitive basis. The most efficient projects for investment are those based on the further stages of processing of Kazakhstani products and raw materials. The possibilities for transit potential in Kazakhstan are also worth mentioning. The projects that could use this transit potential are quite interesting for investments.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You were recently appointed as the new general manager of the KAPP. How would you describe your operational strategy for 2016?</h4><p>The Kuwait Authority for Partnership Projects plays a major role in allowing the private sector's participation in the Kuwaiti economy. The government has, in fact, initiated the Public Private Partnership (PPP) program to promote and establish collaboration between the public and the private sector to ensure well-developed projects for Kuwaiti citizens with effective services. It is our priority to warrant and assure all projects are operating as planned according to the PPP law 116/2014 and its executive regulations, while KAPP receives competitive bids for its current projects that are pivotal to the country's infrastructure. For example, while some projects such as the Kuwait National Rail Road Project or South Al-Jahra Labor City are in the pre-tender phase, others such as the Az-Zour North Power Generation, the Water Desalination Project phase 2, the Umm Al Hayman Wastewater Project, and the Municipal Solid Waste Project are currently under tender. However, it is my obligation to thoroughly evaluate all proposed bids, as we are at a significant phase where we have to be perceptive to the immensity of the projects and their importance to the economy.  On the other hand, we are making every effort to ensure that KAPP projects are advancing as planned as well as delivering most highly infrastructure services through these partnership projects.</p><h4>The KAPP recently received proposals from a number of companies looking to become involved in phase 2 of the Az-Zour North power generation and water desalination project. Who are the primary investors behind these infrastructure megaprojects and what projects will the KAPP particularly be focusing on in 2016?</h4><p>KAPP has recently announced that it received the bids for Az Zour North IWPP Phase 2. It is recognized through regional and global developers' interest, interactions, and visits with vast experience and a successful project portfolio. In addition to developers, global financial institutions, and credit export agencies are the key players behind the project. It is also well noted that there is an increasing interest from local financial institutions and equity holders to take part in it as well. However, KAPP is working on already established projects that are well underway. No specific project is to be referred to, as all current tendered projects are priorities. We strive to ensure that all projects are moving on according to the planned timeline. However, the concept of public-private partnerships is relatively new. It is a challenge to introduce PPP laws to Kuwait's business culture and guide it to adapt and adjust. KAPP's Az-Zour Phase 1 project, however, has been proof of the huge success of PPPs and its benefit to the economy. We have to disseminate awareness of such projects and their requirements, as institutions need time to adapt and deal to this new culture successfully. Moreover, there are numerous other governmental entities with which KAPP cooperates. The Department of Legal Advice and Legislation has especially been fully supportive by ensuring steady legal compliance of projects with the current local regulations of the State of Kuwait. KAPP will always take the initiative to be very cooperative and maintain good mutual ties with related institutions.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>KAPP looks forward to ensuring that all tendered projects are proceeding according to plan. Law No. 116 of 2014 has established our authority, and we are working hard to enable the timely implementation of projects that are of significance to Kuwait's infrastructural development.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The tourism sector in Costa Rica grew three times faster than the national economy in 2015. What are the main areas the ministry has worked on to maximize this sector's potential?</h4><p>It's fair to say that tourism is Costa Rica's main economic sector and the figures prove this. For example, 27% of the country's workforce is employed in the sector; around 29.6% of the country's exports are in tourism and, according to the latest data from the Central Bank, while services represent around 40% of GDP, tourism accounts for 20% of that. We also expect it to grow three or four times faster than the national economy. Moreover, it is extremely diverse, and SMEs represent the great majority of its enterprises. That it is dispersed throughout the country has enabled us to boost investment in all of Costa Rica without favoring one or two areas, bringing investment to regions that otherwise wouldn't have it. At the moment, the average stay is 13 days, a length of time that proves what an array of offerings we have to get people to stay that long.</p><h4>The vast majority of tourists come from the US, with an increase of 21% in the first semester alone of 2016. In general, what is the average tourist profile that visits Costa Rica?</h4><p>The average tourist is culturally well educated, meaning they know what Costa Rica has to offer. We also see that visitors leave the country extremely satisfied, and we have a revisit rate of 30%, which is high. Costa Rica sells life experiences and we see that those who visit are eager to consume them.</p><h4>What kind of projects do you have in mind to further realize the potential of the tourism industry in Costa Rica?</h4><p>Costa Rica is well known in two areas: nature and adventure. According to the World Economic<br>Forum's (WEF's) tourism competitiveness study from 2015, Costa Rica is number one in terms of nature among 140 countries and number two in adventure, just behind New Zealand. This proves that we can compete with the world. Our objective is to further consolidate the country's position in these two areas. At the same time, we are also trying to add to this strategy. For example, the Conventions Centre is a nationwide effort to position the country as a leading destination for MICE tourism. We have started to promote Costa Rica in this field at the international level through fairs and tourism events. To be sure, we are trying to boost our potential in this area across the entire country rather than focusing on one or two cities. Usually, international conventions bring between 50 and 500 guests to the country, a number we can easily accommodate in many areas of the country and not just in the new Convention Centre. We want this facility to become the visible head of this strategy. We see a lot of potential to boost tourism figures through this segment thanks to the fact that it happens in our low season. The MICE tourist spends between USD200 and USD400 per day each, whereas the average tourist we have today spends between USD110 and USD115. So the potential is huge, and we have hired business analysts to better learn how to position ourselves in the MICE segment and maximize the country's potential in this area. We also focusing our development strategy on wellness tourism and want to implement a similar approach as we have with MICE. There are plenty of synergies we can generate with our strong position in the nature and adventure segments. Over the last few years, we have boosted our airport infrastructure across the country, a strategy that has definitely paid off; increased the number of arrivals in regional airports; and attracted many new airlines, the latter largely come from two of our main tourism markets; the US, which represents 40% of our visitors, and Europe, whence we received almost 400,000 visitors in 2015. As for Europe, we have historically been connected to Europe through Iberia, but wanted to diversify to reach to a broader audience so now have British Airways and Condor, which better positions us in the British and German markets. Soon we will have Air France and Edelweiss. While these efforts are already helping us better promote Costa Rica internationally, we have also hired PR agencies in the four main European markets and five main Latin American countries where we see large potential for Costa Rica. And our strategy is focused on getting to know the markets that already visit us even better.</p><h4>Which areas still need improvement and what is the Ministry doing to tackle the seasonality challenge?</h4><p>Visitors leave the country overall very satisfied, but we know we can still get better in some areas. Infrastructure is one of these—even historically so—and we need to work closely with other ministries in order to tackle this. Our efforts to move toward MICE tourism are a good example of what we are doing to minimize the impact of seasonality in the industry. At the same time, we have redirected economic efforts and investments at the Ministry level. Previously, the ICT focused many of its campaigns on the high season—60% of its budget on the high season and 40% on the low. Today we invest 70% of our budget on promoting the low season and 30% on the high. In this context, we need to work together with the private sector to focus our strategies on a common goal.</p><h4>What are the Ministry's objectives for 2017?</h4><p>The Convention Centre needs to be ready and fully operating. We will also continue attracting new airlines and working closely with the different PR agencies in Europe. These combined efforts should allow us to break the seasonality factor. We are also looking at redefining our strategy for attracting tourism investment in order to get more funds for infrastructure areas like hotels. In terms of cruises, we want to bring back some companies that left several years ago and boost this segment of the tourism industry. We also expect to release the results of a pioneering study at the international level to measure the contribution of tourism to a country's development of a country, something that's never before been done. We are calling it the Social Progress Index in tourism. This index will enable us to better know what the tourism industry generates in each region and community to help us to better define public policies for these areas and really understand their needs. Our aim is for the tourism industry to ensure the welfare and support the social development of every community and region in the country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What characteristics differentiate Tanga Cement in such a competitive sector?</h4><p>The quality of our products is a key differentiator, but so is their sustainability. Our product is consistent across the market. We do not believe in being good one day and bad the next. We have invested in this country and in this company, spending money on equipment that will sustain our presence here for generations. We are definitely the greenest player and there are various ways you can measure it; for example, the amount of CO2 produced per ton of cement or the saving we are making by implementing technology. We have established bag filters in our new plant, which are designed to European standards. When the new plant was completed it will follow the same rules and standards, with low electricity consumption, low water consumption, and zero emissions.</p><h4>Are you thinking of expanding to other countries in the region?</h4><p>Afrisam is a South African-based company, so we form part of the group and represent its African expansion strategy. Tanga Cement as a company does not currently have any ambitions to expanding into other countries except via market penetration through sales.</p><h4>What is your in-country shipping and logistics strategy?</h4><p>There is no better way to transport cement than on rail. We are blessed by the fact that we are the only cement plant with a rail line right into our factory; therefore, we load directly onto the rail track. Then, we also have depots from which we can offload directly from the tracks again. We never have to have an intermediate step between the plant and the rail line, which makes us one of the most efficient players in the market. Yes, there is room for improvement as far as rail operations go but we want to be part of optimizing that together with TRL, which is why we have signed an agreement with it.</p><h4>What are the main challenges Tanga Cement faces?</h4><p>Our top three challenges are price, taxation, and newcomers. We are in an extremely competitive environment and Tanzania is one of the few countries that for the past 10 years has been able to achieve consistent growth. This attracted other players to the market, which has put pressure on prices. Some importers have brought a lot of cement in through the ports, and unfortunately there are a lot of illegal imports as well.</p><h4>What opportunities with the new government-led drive for sustainable long-term development are there? </h4><p>The opportunities lay in the optimization of your footprint, cost structures, and production capacities. At the same time, one has to realize that if you construct a cement plant properly, sticking to the safety standards, financial rules, permits, access to raw materials and so on, it takes at least two years to construct. So in the short-term, for a new investor considering constructing a totally new integrated plant, the opportunities are small, because you need a huge balance sheet to foot this bill.</p><h4>What are your goals for the near future?</h4><p>We have implemented a rigorous optimization and efficiency drive within the company, which started in roughly mid-2015. The results for the first half of 2016 were a 55% increase in net profit. The future will continue in this vein because of what we have done and how we have done it. One thing we are happy about is the successful conclusion of our expansion project, which makes us totally independent of any raw material importation. We are self-sufficient in the supply of clinker and can now produce all that is required by the country by using only locally produced goods.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the key mentality change you would like to establish in Malaysia?</h4><p>Looking at the innovation mentality, our goal is to see how we can help cultivate a thinking culture and equip the next generation with creative and critical thinking skills. We have embarked on three programs since we were established in 2011. The first is called I-Think, which aims to implement innovative learning tools in schools. Furthermore, we have introduced the International Baccalaureate (IB) program in 10 government schools in Malaysia, and eight of these have already received IB certification since the project started two years ago. These are not elite schools; they are a cross section of the country. We are studying how these new teaching and learning methods can influence the school system and ultimately change the mentality of our students. A third program is Genovasi, a design school in Petaling Jaya that has already produced 2,500 graduates since its establishment three years ago. The school targets young working graduates who can follow the Innovation Ambassador Development Program, which was developed to introduce design thinking in the workplace. Cultivating a culture of innovation among our future generation is a long-term objective, and we intend to combine elements of what we learn from I-Think, IB, and Genovasi into innovation programs at our secondary schools. Our agency is governed by a council of seven ministers, with the Prime Minister as our Chairman. Innovation essentially cuts across everything, enabling us to help to move the agenda with all the relevant ministries.</p><h4>How does Malaysia fit into the global innovation landscape, and why would multinationals choose to have their R&amp;D here?</h4><p>Multinationals here are supported with various programs, such as CREST for the E&amp;E industry that actively links them with academia and local SMEs, often when looking for joint research models. Other programs we have put in place typically target SMEs, especially to support them with commercialization. We have PlaTCOM Ventures providing end-to-end facilitation for companies to take the important final step to commercialize their findings. Around 100 SMEs have been accepted into the program, of which 10 have achieved commercialization. We have access to global IP databases, and we teach people how to protect their ideas with IP strategy. PlaTCOM also oversees all the IPs in our universities and research institutes. There is large flow of government funding for R&amp;D into these institutions, and we match these IPs with commercialization partners to get the licenses done. Another program that we started is Steinbeis, originally a German organization. It has been successful in providing a platform to link industry directly with subject matter experts. This is particularly useful for SMEs that run into a roadblock during their development trajectory where they need expert advice. Steinbeis uses its extensive network to find the right expertise, and is responsible for the agreement, pricing, and arrangement, making it cost-effective.</p><h4>What is the potential for biomass and what role can AIM play?</h4><p>We developed a national biomass strategy to identify opportunities to better utilize our biomass. Typically, palm oil biomass is thrown back into fields as fertilizer or is burnt for fuel—both do not give high returns. We seek to diversify the downstream here and explore creating biofuels, biochemical, and bioplastics. Malaysia is the world's second-largest producer of palm oil, with more than 18 million tons of crude palm oil, which results in 100 million tons of solid biomass. Whilst mapping out the country, we discovered the biggest opportunities in Sabah and Sarawak and are now working with these states to form steering committees. When these development programs are properly executed, the potential will be great and will create highly skilled jobs. In Sabah, we are launching a project to turn palm kernel cake, one of the biomasses left after you crush palm shells, into bioethanol and high protein animal feed with the use of enzymes. This has the potential to substantially reduce our requirements for imported animal feed, especially for chickens.</p><h4>You recently combined all innovation funds into one fund to make the process more streamlined. How did this come into practice?</h4><p>Three years ago, we formed the Investment Committee for Public Funds to align all government agencies and 14 ministries that are involved in funding R&amp;D. In the first year, we discovered that 25% of funding requests were potentially duplicated, as there was a lack of communication between the ministries. Our first objective was to eliminate duplication. Secondly, we wanted to have more accountability for how funds are used, set common goals and KPIs, and organize a proper tracking of the R&amp;D outcomes. We also wanted to have a balance in the funding landscape, not to have too much focus in any one area, and eliminate gaps in the funding landscape. This committee will possibly transition into a research management agency, which will have a broader mandate and manage the research assets in the country, all human capital, labs, and equipment.</p><h4>How is AIM working toward sustainable, inclusive growth, as expressed in the nation's Eleventh Malaysia Plan?</h4><p>We started on social innovation a year ago in a public private partnership format to see how we could support the third sector with all social purpose organizations (SPOs)—ranging from social enterprises to NGOs. We started several programs to discover how social impact can be measured, for which we ultimately developed a social impact measurement toolkit, freely available from our website. We want to change the mindset in social sector, for them to work more efficiently, to measure the impact of their works, and to teach them how to get funded. We are currently working on a social progress assessment to identify the unit costs data for the key social issues in the country that impacts society at large. For this, we identified 40 key social issues over a broad range of topics and determined what the cost to the public sector is for each of those. Then we input data into a social financing model, through which we can discover how we can save government spending by addressing social issues. This is an atypical avenue for CSR activities of the corporate world; however, we believe it has great potential and can change the way the government approaches social issues.</p><h4>What will be the legacy of your work at the end of AIM's mandate in 2020? </h4><p>One of the reasons why we had this 10-year timeframe was to have some level of urgency to move the innovation agenda. We also did not want to become another government agency that would permanently require public funding, as at the end of the day innovation should be primarily driven by the private sector. Many of our programs will continue without AIM, either on their own or with the support of other agencies. Steinbeis was set up as a non-profit foundation and works to be self-sufficient; all fees that are collected cover the operating costs. This model is self-sustaining, does not need government funding, and will be part of the innovation ecosystem. Similarly, PlaTCOM is set up as a company and continues as a private limited company, collecting fees from IP advisory and other consultancy. Genovasi, the design thinking school, has been privatized and will transform into a university, supported by private sector investments.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What policies is the Ministry pursuing to demonstrate policy continuity under the country's new government?</h4><p>Our government promotes industrialization and in doing so we look for sectors that can employ a good number of people. One area is agri-processing. We want to ensure that we produce enough food and that we come up with the industries to process that food to reduce the post-harvest loss. At the same time, this will create employment for people working in farms, factories, and the transportation sector. We aim to create employment for at least 40% of the able workforce in Tanzania. As part of this, we focus on the modernization of agriculture and achieving high productivity. We want to ensure we can produce sufficient goods and services to meet local demand, as well as specialized goods for export abroad. We want to achieve import substitution and export promotion. We want our products to be of an international standard. The trend toward urbanization means we need to promote industries that serve an urban population. For example, there is a need for bottled water, food, and light industries. Having these industries in the country ensures that we do not spend the little money we have on importing goods that we can produce ourselves. We also have some major flagship projects planned. We want to ensure that in this phase we start up the long-time Mchuchuma coal and Liganga iron-ore mining projects. These projects have been on the books and in the government's budgets for over 30 years. These projects will feed our steel industry and in line with this, we also want to improve our energy mix. We want to deliver 600MW from Mchuchuma, with 250MW being used for iron smelting and the rest being fed into the national grid to supply power nationwide. We also have a fertilizer project starting in 2016 in Lindi. It involves an international consortium led by German company Ferrostaal Industrial Projects GmbH and will produce around 1.3 million metric tons of fertilizer per year. The production of fertilizer in Tanzania will be a game-changer for us as agricultural yields will increase. With higher productivity in farming, we will have cotton and food available at reasonable prices. People can be more comfortable if they have to spend less money on food. We want to support the cotton industry and we have a strategy to improve its value chain. With the integration of the cotton chain, this will lead to more employment in the entire system, from cotton growing to clothing manufacturing. In other areas, we look to set up a tire manufacturing to service the car industry. I have a mandate from the government to do this and we are working on this. This would start as a state-owned company and then be sold to the private sector.</p><h4>Going forward, how will you manage imports of fertilizers and cotton, as well as prices, to protect investors in these local industries?</h4><p>The protection mechanism we intend to use will ensure that whatever we import is of a high quality and is taxed according to existing laws. With this, I am confident that our companies will be strong enough to compete. Some companies currently dump substandard and counterfeit products on the Tanzanian market and do not pay duties and taxes. This is why our local companies have not been able to compete in the past. Furthermore, with our new consortium we will have players coming into the market who are competent in their industries so we do not expect to give subsidies.</p><h4>What is the ministry's view on public ownership and will there be a greater role for the state in the national economy in the coming years?</h4><p>Under our government, there is no such nationalization vocabulary. During the privatization processes, businesses were allocated industries and factories to operate at a profit. They were sold assets at a token price on the condition that they produce goods and services, create employment, and pay taxes. In cases where they have failed to meet these conditions, we ask them to find someone else to run the business. However, there are many genuine reasons why these businesses do not perform. We are working through the reasons and providing guidance. A good number are back on the right track now. For example, some businesses were failing because there was no power; however, we now produce around 1,400MW from gas, hydro, and renewable sources so there is enough electricity available today. Nationalization is not taking place. The government is not taking industry back; if we want to become involved in a sector we will start our own businesses or factories. We want private sector assets to be profitable because they are strategically located and they support the country's basic infrastructure. The best way to protect our local industries is to work on enforcing existing tax and importation regulations, which we oversee.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead for the ministry and for Tanzania in general?</h4><p>I see us going into industrialization and Tanzania becoming a middle-income country before 2025. We have a new outlook because this government is trying to make sure that every player receives fair treatment. Some people pay taxes while others do not. This is a friendly government with an emphasis on ease of doing business. We want to make sure that all private investors are treated equally. We want to provide a fair and level playing field for each and everyone. Therefore, anyone interested in investing in Tanzania is welcome and we are open to working with everybody.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us about the history of Maritima Dominicana?</h4><p>I started Maritima Dominicana in March 1971 with the help of my brother-in-law, Gustavo Tavares, and there were only three employees. Then, in 1973, I founded another company called Caribetrans, which was involved in warehousing and airfreight forwarding. Caribetrans today has warehouses in every airport in the Dominican Republic, and also 10,000sqm of warehouses in the city. We also created a company called Terminales Haina, which has custom warehouses where consolidated cargo is taken from every port once it has cleared customs and is then delivered to the receivers. Then, we began a firm called Almatrans Logistics that operates fiscal warehouses and logistics centers, before forming an inland transportation company called Equipos y Transportes, which today owns more than 1,200 chassis and many trucks and other equipment to handle containers in the ports and off-dock facilities. Then, we built an entity called Mardom Projects that handles heavy lift cargo both for loading and discharging and local transportation. As a matter of fact, Mardom Group participated in handling the heaviest pieces in the history of the Caribbean, having handled four pieces of 720 tons when Barrick Gold was being established in the Dominican Republic. Finally, we created a company called Reefer Services to provide repair and maintenance services for every shipping company involved in reefer containers in the DR, and also for dry containers. We provide all these services so that global companies only need one logistic service provider in the entire country. And our group has now about 1.500 employees.</p><h4>How are you involved in the Port Caucedo logistics terminal, and how is it affecting the wider landscape of transportation in the region?</h4><p>If each company had its own warehouse with a large inventory, it would be quite expensive. Therefore, they outsource this to service providers such as Almatrans and Caribetrans, because we can bring in whatever they need each week and deliver it in time for manufacturing. This is what happens at the logistic centers. This is the essence of supply chain logistics where we handle ocean and airfreight transportation, custom clearance, and warehousing. We are also one of the first companies certified as an Authorized Economic Operator, which is where external auditors determine that our procedures are accurate and honest. We are also certified ISO 9001, ISO 14001, and OHSAS 18.001. We are also certified by the World BASC Organization with respect to the security of all our activities. Every government entity, such as the port authority, customs, and security, wants to be sure that we, as service providers in the ports and airports, do this correctly and honestly. Once the auditors determine that this is indeed the case then they give us this certification. As a whole, the opportunity for a logistics center was created by the Dominican government with legal decree 262-15, which was established last year in order to create a legal structure and opportunities for the expansion of logistics for local and other cargo that can be distributed throughout the Caribbean. Since then, Caucedo has established one building but will build many more that will be able to handle the kind of merchandise being shipped to these logistics centers. Here, shippers can either get their cargo to local customers and then pay customs and VAT, for example, or ship it to other destinations in the Caribbean without having to pay local taxes. The port of Haina will also provide these same services. As a matter of fact, one of our chief executives, Salvador Figueroa, is the president of an entity created for this purpose, the Association of Dominican Logistics Operators and Centers (ASOLOGIC). The ports of both Caucedo and Haina have an important opportunity to develop these additional capacities.</p><h4>What is the essential cargo that MarDom handles and where do you see future growth?</h4><p>We believe the agricultural sector will be able to increase the volume of exports to the US and Europe. Around 20 years ago, we handled between 50 and 60 containers of pineapples every week bound for the US from Dole and Chiquita. Back then, these large fruit and vegetable suppliers had their own shipping companies, but many now outsource this to container shipping companies. This is also how we became the service provider for all banana exports and handled three weekly fixed-day services of vessels to take them to Europe. We believe not only that the Dominican Republic will be able to increase production of fruits and vegetables for export around the world, but also that the production of manufactured goods in the free zones will continue to increase, especially given the new decree that simplifies these supply-chain logistics. This will make it easier to bring in the materials these manufacturers need to produce local products like clothing, shoes, and electrical equipment. The Dominican Republic has several large free zones that do this already, but the opportunity to increase productivity and the number of products that can be manufactured locally is tremendous.</p><h4>How do you see the shipping industry playing out over the next five years?</h4><p>More large shipping companies are going to start consolidating, a trend that has already begun over the last two years. Many global carriers are now working closely together or are buying other companies in order to reduce internal costs of their operations and survive the economic crisis within the industry. We could also have other incidents like the insolvency of Hanjin, which has created a lot of uncertainty within the market. All of their ships were suddenly stopped, and the cargo onboard was not discharged at the port of destination until the port terminals could determine whether they were going to be paid for their services. Hence, there is some fear within the sector that other carriers might have to declare insolvency.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As the largest East African economy, how can increased cooperation with Oman bring mutual benefit to both countries?</h4><p>Kenya is strategically placed within the East and Central African region and accounts for about 40% of the region's GDP. More than that, we are a gateway to the region and therefore provide a direct link to a potential market of 170 million people within the East African Community. We are already quite well integrated within the region, having one of the most vibrant common markets. Increased cooperation between Kenya and Oman would allow Oman not only access to the region, but also the growing Kenyan market and the improving investment environment. With a projected GDP growth of 5.9% in 2016, the Kenyan economy provides enormous opportunities and potential for mutually beneficial business interactions between the two countries. In line with growth of 5.9% in 2016, the Kenyan economy provides enormous opportunities and potential for mutually-beneficial business within the region. Specific areas of interest to business include eco-tourism, power generation equipment, road construction, telecommunications equipment, food processing, cement production, motor vehicle parts, and agricultural inputs, among others. Kenya intends to enhance cooperation with Oman in these and other sectors for mutual benefit, as both countries continue to diversify their economies. For instance, having only discovered oil recently, Kenya could benefit from Oman's experience in this sector. Kenya also works closely with Oman in the multilateral arena, particularly within the context of South-South cooperation and shares the ideals of peaceful resolution to conflict. Our two countries have continued to benefit from people-to-people interactions and cultural ties, which have helped to shape relations in all other sectors.</p><h4>How are you working to attract visitors to Kenya?</h4><p>Kenya is home to some of the most diverse wildlife in the world, including being home to the spectacular annual wildebeest migration in the world-famous Maasai Mara National Park, and various non-wildlife attractions. Kenya has identified the need to create more product awareness about the distinct tourism attractions and to attract more visitors from the GCC region. In this regard, marketing development representatives were appointed to market Kenya product awareness, and also actively participate in regional tourism expos, such as the Arabian Travel Market in Dubai, and hosted our own Magical Kenya Travel Expo in Nairobi in October, 2016, in which travel agents from the GCC were invited to participate. In addition, Kenya has launched the “Yalla Kenya“ campaign, which specifically targets the GCC region. The campaign, which means “Go Kenya,“ has been launched in the UAE and is expected to be rolled out across the rest of the bloc. Kenya and Oman have a rich cultural and historical affinity, with the coast of Kenya having strong historical ties with Arabs from across the Gulf of Aden, which saw the introduction of Islam by Omani traders along the coast of Kenya. With approximately 11% of the population of Kenya (over 4.5 million) being Muslim, Omani travelers feel at home as halal food is available everywhere, mosques are located in all parts of the country, and the Kiswahili language is widely spoken. Major airlines including Kenya Airways, Qatar, Etihad, Emirates, and Air Arabia provide seamless connections between Kenya and Oman. The impending commencement of direct flights from Muscat to Nairobi in 2017 will provide a big boost to Kenyan ties with Arabs from the GCC region. The presence of the Embassy of Kenya in Muscat ensures that the process of issuing visas is much faster. Despite this, the number of tourist arrivals from Oman and the GCC has not been as high as we would want them to be. We intend to escalate our awareness campaign and strategy toward increasing the inflow of tourists from the region.</p><h4>What are some of the efforts currently undertaken by the governments of Kenya and Oman to maintain the safe passage of maritime trade in the coastal areas between Kenya and Oman?</h4><p>The maritime sector plays a significant role in the social and economic development of Kenya. Maritime transport, tourism, and fishing are key. Kenya is in the process of developing an integrated and cross-sector maritime policy to help accelerate economic growth. Similarly, and in recognition of the importance of the maritime sector within the African continent, the African Heads of State and Government adopted and signed the African Charter on Maritime Security, Safety, and Development in October 2016. Several years ago, piracy and armed robberies against ships were rampant along the Western Indian Ocean and Gulf of Aden, arising from the on-going conflict in Somalia. This posed a threat to people and to the general peace in the region and beyond. As active members of the Indian Ocean Rim Association for Regional Cooperation (IOR-ARC) and the International Maritime Organization (IMO), Kenya and Oman have been working closely in the promotion and protection of interests within the Indian Ocean and in pursuing maritime safety and security issues. The two countries are similarly in the process of concluding a MoU between Salalah Port Services and Kenya Ports Authority, which is aimed at enhancing cooperation between the two major port cities within the two countries and improving their economic and strategic cooperation. We recognize that Oman has a long and successful maritime history and will continue to work together in order to benefit from their invaluable experience, as we seek to develop and safeguard the blue economy.</p><h4>Oman and Kenya enjoy strong historic and traditional ties. How does Kenya view Oman as a strategic partner in the region to access markets in the GCC and greater Middle East?</h4><p>Kenya and Oman have traded for centuries and our diplomatic relations go way back, making Oman one of Kenya's strategic partners in the GCC. Trade has been expanding over time, although it is not at the level that both countries wish to attain. Oman therefore presents a huge potential market for Kenyan products, including beef and other by-products, nuts, tea, coffee, and flowers. Our countries are exploring ways and means of opening more avenues of cooperation to be able to achieve this. Among these strategies is to increase the direct interaction between our two Chambers of Commerce and Industry, in order to deepen people-to-people interaction and enhance our trade, business, and investment ties. Salalah is widely acknowledged as the eastern gateway to the GCC, while Mombasa is the gateway to Eastern and Central Africa. The proximity of Salalah to Kenya and to eastern and central Africa allows for the facilitation of trade in goods between the two countries and their respective regions. The development of the Salalah Free Zone provides an opportunity for Kenyan investors to add value to Kenyan products within the Sultanate and to access preferential markets within the GCC. Cooperation between our two ports will ensure their development into regional logistics hubs. We are keen to improve the movement of people, goods, and services as a means of attracting further investments and increasing trade volumes between our two countries. In this regard, we will support any efforts by our national carriers to resume flights on this route.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[global-outlook]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the genesis and evolution of Tanto Capital Partners since you co-founded it two years ago?</h4><p>I am proud of our company's growth and performance over these two years. Our investment thesis has always been based on creating value, and in this case we believe Tanto Capital Partner's value proposition is embedded in being able to combine capital, world-class execution, and also the access we have to proprietary transactions across the world where we invest together alongside some of the world's largest families. In this sense, we have started to morph into a niche merchant bank, one in which we offer advisory services focusing on the debt side of the capital structure and leverage the numerous years and billions of dollars of transaction origination, structuring, and trading experience the team brings together. What makes a difference in this regard is that, in addition to having worked in the world's top investment banks and financial institutions for an average of 20 years each, the senior management have also worked together for numerous years. It is the trust, commitment, and firm value system that we bring to the mix which in my view creates the fundamental added value to our investors and clients alike. With this in mind, we are currently in the process of launching our first open-ended fund, giving certain high-impact UHNW individuals and their families the opportunity to participate alongside others in what we believe is one of the best risk-adjusted return trades of the past few years. This single-strategy fund is focused on acquiring the single B and equity tranches of European Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs). This opportunity is a niche one, driven by the need of the European Banks to sell down their exposure due to the impact of Basel III and Volcker rule which makes these assets much more expensive for banks to hold than it used to be. Ultimately, this is another example of Tanto Capital Partners adding value to their investors and clients alike. As the global macro-economic and geopolitical realities shift, investment opportunities that provide the best risk-adjusted returns for investors also change, which is where Tanto Capital Partners will always be present in identifying, originating, and executing these trades on behalf of its investors and clients.</p><h4>What markets do you focus on primarily?</h4><p>Tanto Capital Partners started as a fund, but we are now on the way to becoming a merchant bank. This wasn't by design but by evolution. We focus on financing transactions, and ultimately we deal with debt and focus on the mezzanine and illiquid parts of the capital structure. We have transactions in Argentina, the US, Europe and Africa. The sectors of focus in our closed-end investment vehicle have primarily been oil and gas, energy and power, infrastructure, and finance, which means that by default we have been heavily involved in emerging markets. However, I believe in focusing on asset classes, sectors, and capital structure rather than any particular region, especially since there are so many cross-border opportunities that we do not want to miss. As value investors, our medium to long-term interest is in the energy and infrastructure sector, especially in those countries where the positive demographics and the emergence of a more affluent middle class offer development opportunities which could translate into rapid economic growth when supported by adequate infrastructure network. We see great opportunities to use private capital to finance such developments and to take over the increasingly large market left unserved by a banking system overburdened by increasing regulatory requirements.</p><h4>What geopolitical shifts and risks are you currently watching?</h4><p>The direction of global geopolitics, and the increasing risks surrounding multiple regions across the world, combined with a chronic deflationary and low rates environment has forced investors to take more risk in order to achieve the levels of return they seek. The current macro-economic situation is partially-driven by the global economic crisis of 2008, and the subsequent reaction to the crisis As various governments around the world bailed out the banks and started utilizing their significant financial muscle to 'normalize' the situations, what started as a financial crisis transformed in to a sovereign crisis. We are all now familiar with quantitative easing, or the printing of large amounts of money and increase of the money supply which has resulted in a deep compression of yields in both the short and long term and has resulted in inflated stock markets and asset prices across the globe. It is easy to criticize central banks and governments, as they had to deal with a level of severity not witnessed since the Great Depression. However I do think we need to acknowledge the flaws in this approach. Ultimately, what they have done is to kick the ball down the line and defer the inevitable, namely a significant and painful correction. Of course this is neither politically feasible nor realistic given the infinitely more globalized economy we live in compared to the 1930s. Right now, I do not think the lawmakers and central bankers quite know what to expect, particularly in Europe, which is looking at Japan's current situation for an idea of what to expect going forward. We are also seeing an interesting yet dangerous worldwide social phenomenon with populist far-right and far-left movements such as Syriza in Greece, Podemos in Spain, the prospect of Trump presidency in the US, and Brexit all gaining traction. The sad reality is that young people in particular have become so hopeless and their belief in social mobility so deteriorated that they see no way out. Globally, US hegemony and power is being increasingly challenged, by China in the long term and by Russia in the short term. Add to this growing anti-western, anti-US sentiment that is fast spreading across the world, and the multiple serious conflicts in the Middle East, the Subcontinent, and Asia Pacific, and unfortunately the picture we see is one in which rising geopolitical tensions are growing.</p><h4>What emerging markets would you say offer the best investment value right now?</h4><p>I would say Mexico, India, China, and selectively Turkey, Argentina, and East Africa. I like Mexico, as the government has implemented significant reforms, and it offers the fundamentals of relatively rapid growth and has a significant part of its trade linked to the US. India, despite growing tensions with Pakistan and China, offers tremendous access to a fast-growing, large, and dynamic population. China, despite the slowdown of its growth and the various pockets of asset price bubble it nurses, is growing ever more important and relevant to the global economy. Turkey, although facing geopolitical and structural challenges, offers an arbitrage to investors that truly have a sense of what is going on in the country and can take a buy and hold position for two-and-a-half to three years, particularly within the fixed income space. Yes, the country has problems, and yes there are significant hurdles in rebuilding the dialog and trust with international investors especially in the aftermath of the attempted coup in July. However, the fear shown by most investors has been excessive considering the reality of the situation, and there are many selective opportunities in certain asset classes. In Africa, investors need to take a truly long-term view of more than ten years and differentiate between countries. Regarding the term of investments, I do not think it matters as long as investments are made in assets that yield a significant annual return in the form of dividends that can be upstreamed. The focus on the exit of the investment is one that is ambiguous, as IPO markers are nowhere near as sophisticated as most of the remainder of the emerging markets and direct sales may not take place easily in the short to medium term. Finally, Argentina offers an interesting case for shorter-term trade-related, or longer-term infrastructure-related investments. Although President Macri and his team are capable and have been the darlings of international investors thus far, their longevity will be the litmus test for those investors rightly questioning whether their almost revolutionary reversal of Kirscherist populist policies will mean that the population will suffer in the short term before things get better. Thus, opportunities do exist, but I think investors should moderate their excitement to take account of the reality that it will take time to change things around.</p><h4>What are your forecasts for 2017 for both Tanto Capital and global markets?</h4><p>Emerging markets will improve globally, just because money is there and it needs a home. Inflows will continue, albeit more selectively. The US will continue to do well, although the effect of the US election remains to be seen. Europe will start to feel the structural difficulties it faces and that will dominate the headlines, especially in relation to Brexit. I would expect the risk premium of EM debt to potentially go through a repricing, especially for countries such as Turkey, Russia, and even India. Capital markets will continue to play an important role. In my view, equities are significantly overvalued, and I fail to see how it can be sustained, and as such I believe credit is the space that will offer the best risk-adjusted returns for investors.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are INMA Steel's plans in this delicate time for the local economy?</h4><p>The current economic situation filters companies. Those companies not on a strong footing will go and that is good for clients as they are left with good healthy competition. INMA Steel's approach tells people that we are here to stay. Many companies are having second thoughts now with oil prices and activity dropping. We believe this is a good time to look at acquisitions and get geared up for the next cycle. We believe it is a cycle and we are going to be here. In mid-2016, we will move into the new facility we are building in the industrial area in Jubail. Going to a new facility definitely gives you more exposure and the client more confidence. We will have more state-of-the-art equipment, and we are investing in new technology as well at our new facility. We continually invest in technology; however, we are thinking of taking it a step further in terms of different welding technologies and services. Therefore, we are not only building a new building; we want the contents to have some real substance. We are investing more and more in heat exchanger repair and manufacturing equipment. On the repair side we are investing more and more in technologies that will make the repairs better, faster, and safer. With all these areas, we are keeping our ear to the ground. We are attending trade shows and looking at what different companies around the world are doing in terms of best practices and experience. The approach will be changing, and we believe that will give us a better exposure to those things.</p><h4>Saudi Arabia is the world's biggest exporter of oil and the government wants to expand to be the world's biggest producer of petrochemicals as well. Do you see opportunities in this and what are the trends in the petrochemical industry?</h4><p>Saudi Arabia made that bet in the 1980s when it built Jubail. When it built Jubail, the idea was that the country wanted to get into this business big-time. The challenge is there is not enough feedstock of gas for every plant that wants to expand. If managed properly, then Saudi Arabia will be placed to expand. Companies are not only involved in developing the basic industry now; a lot of them are taking it a step further and making secondary products. Both the primary and secondary industries will have opportunities. There is room for expansion in refineries, chemicals, and petrochemicals, as well as taking it a step down. The big question is how to use that to our advantage. Everyone wants to increase their reliability. For example, most of the equipment in these plants is made of carbon or stainless steel. We have just finished doing aluminum and titanium qualifications because in the near future companies will be looking for more reliable materials for replacement parts and new plants to cut down on shutdowns and problems. We are trying to keep up with this wave so that we are not disrupted or left behind as a business. This is where I see the opportunities and there are two factors going forward that we need to capture these new opportunities. The first is to have new qualifications in higher-end materials and in more reliable technology. We need to stay on top of the engineering, skills, and current know-how. The other factor is keeping your costs on a par with other companies because putting money into technology has an impact on how you bid. Therefore, we need to look at cost structures and our ability to give clients better products at least at the same price.</p><h4>How does the government's Saudization program impact on your workforce?</h4><p>It is a challenge, not to get the people but to retain them. It is easy to get Saudi personnel; however, you have to be competitive as an employer to retain these people. If you go to any refinery or oil rig most of the people are Saudis. The point is you have to give your staff not only money, but career development, training, and opportunities to grow and be promoted. That is the key because many of them fear that they will not get this. It is a matter of building that culture and a belief in them that they will be able to make it. You have to engage people and we are doing that quite well.</p><h4>Are all your operations in Saudi Arabia, and are you planning to expand internationally?</h4><p>We are only here in Saudi Arabia. SABIC, with all its subsidiaries, and Saudi Aramco are our two main clients. Saudi International Petrochemical Company (Sipchem), the National Industrialization Company (Tasnee), and the Advanced Petrochemical Company are our clients. We are considering getting more exposure in the Gulf by opening in Abu Dhabi and Bahrain. However, we are not planning to do this on our own; we are looking at strategic partnerships. At the moment, we are talking to companies that do not have the long history or the knowledge and experience that we have; however, they do have the personnel, the contacts, and the ground support. Our aim is to have a strong team engaged all year long on this work, and the only way to do that is to get a bigger exposure.</p><h4>What are INMA Steel's goals and expectations for 2016?</h4><p>In mid-2016, we want to move to our new facility and at least do the first step in that full out-sourcing and maintenance service with one of our clients. We want to start that as a pilot in 2016. Currently we have one large fabrication shop and three small ones, and we will have two large shops at the new facility. We are slowly expanding into new services and our new fabrication shop will give us the opportunity to be able to grow because our existing shop has some limitations. Today, our focus is static mechanical equipment. Our long-term goal is to take the maintenance burden from our clients so they can just remain as asset owners. Our plan is that companies such as Aramco or SABIC will own the plant and the production, and have their own operational staff, but the maintenance, shut-downs, and repairs will all be done by us. We want to take the headache away for the owners. The end-game for us is to be the company that the clients out-source all that maintenance work to.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What makes IMCC a revolutionary and pioneering company in Iran and the region?</h4><p>IMCC is a pioneering management company specialized in retail assets and is the first of its kind in Iran due to its corporate structure and modern managerial techniques in line with the international standards of this industry. IMCC is a leading and prominent company that rotates exciting ideas into lucrative and worthwhile businesses. This company, as the operator of Iran Mall and Hotel Development, is a subsidiary of Tat Group. Iran Mall Commercial Co., as a prominent and well-established company and a leading mall operator throughout Iran, with its shopping malls and mixed-use facilities, intends to facilitate brand owners' business by providing necessary and adequate information about Iran's market, such as consumer habits and their needs and necessities, through our technical, legal, managerial, and commercial experts. IMCC intends to turn novel and remarkable ideas into lucrative and cost-effective businesses. We truly believe that IMCC is set to become the biggest giant mall operator in the Middle East, and we will not rely solely on mall management but will also undertake master franchises and enter into joint ventures with famous brands yet to enter the Iranian market.</p><h4>How do you assess the ability of Iran Mall's facilities to compete with the greatest international shopping centers?</h4><p>In comparison with other shopping malls in the world, Iran Mall is the largest shopping mall in the region and is one of the top-ranked shopping malls in the world. Iran Mall will encompass among the best facilities and amenities we can find in the greatest shopping centers internationally. Iran Mall also provides a new benchmark in the shopping experience in Tehran and all of Iran. In the ever-growing world of gigantic and luxurious malls, we are proud to present Iran Mall as the largest mall within all of the Middle East, with a total area of around 1,700,000sqm, and a 250,000sqm leasable area. In fact, this unique project is so massive that it has been described by RLI International Magazine of Leisure and Entertainment as “a city on its own." A simple comparison between Iran Mall and two of its rivals in the Middle East—Dubai Mall and Mall of the Emirates—shows the superiority of Iran Mall in holding a number of distinctive features: 16 anchors and mini anchors; various parking entrances opening to different floors and a parking capacity of 20,000 vehicles; three commercial towers on a specific 240,000sqm ground; more mall services, including an exhibition area of 20,000sqm; a five-star hotel offering a spectacular view of the Alborz mountains; and an incredible rooftop garden.</p><h4>What is your opinion on the development of the tourism sector in Iran and your potential role in it?</h4><p>Iran is a culturally and historically rich country with a great tourism capacity; however, the country lacks modern infrastructure to cater to tourists needs; Iran Mall is one of the first steps taken to build such a quality offering with a unique shopping venue and state-of-the-art hotel facilities (four and five stars) in an area of Tehran centrally located away from the heavy traffic of the city but close to the international airport. Iran Mall has been designed as a retail and entertainment complex soaring way beyond the boundaries of the concept of malls in Iran, a place in which age or taste shall not be a matter of concern, and a place where apart from shopping all that is best, visitors may also seek novel and diverse experiences of beauty, elegance, tranquility, tradition, modernity, food and drink, leisure, excitement, and sport all gathered in one place. To support the fact that apart from offering utmost luxuriousness, we have kept a keen eye on capacity for leisure, cultural, and other public activities, we are proud to say this five-story mix mall has the lowest ratio of GLA to GBA in the world, at 0.17. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are HEGTA's capabilities to contribute to the development of the tourism industry in Iran?</h4><p>HEGTA is the biggest tourism holding in Iran and is part of the Social Security Organization, the biggest non-governmental company in the country with 300 companies under its control. HEGTA was established two years ago and has seven subsidiaries, some of which have 50 years of experience in the tourism industry. One of them is Homa Hotels Group, the oldest hotel chain in Iran with five five-star hotels across the country. We also have shares of the Iran Touring &amp; Tourism Investment Company (ITTIC), which is the largest hotel chain in Iran with 64 hotels. We are one of the biggest tourism construction companies, with about 2,000 tourism apartments constructed across Iran. HEGTA also owns RAJA Rail Transportation Company, which manages 70% of passenger railway travel in Iran, accounting for 30 million people per annum.</p><h4>How do you assess the potential of Iran to become a health tourism hub in the region?</h4><p>As part of the Social Security Organization, which plays a key role in the healthcare sector in Iran, we have plans to expand and develop facilities for health tourism, where currently we have 400 clinics and 70 hospitals available to provide services. We started our programs to promote health tourism in Iran in neighboring countries like Azerbaijan. We have the knowledge and facilities according to Western standards, plus surgery and operation costs are low compared to other countries. Although this is a new sector in Iran and we are one of the first companies that started working on this issue, looking at the level of Iranian doctors and the interest coming from Iraq, Turkey, and Western Asian countries, we aim to facilitate health tourism growth in Iran.</p><h4>How is HEGTA renovating the hotel infrastructure to adapt to international standards?</h4><p>Over the last 40 years, Iran has not constructed many new hotels. According to a European study, we need more than 700 four- and five-star hotels to achieve our goal of 25 million tourists. In this sense, HEGTA will construct 100 of these hotels in 31 provinces across the country. We introduced a project called “100 hotels, 100 businesses," where we invite national and international companies to start cooperating with us. We are organizing conferences to welcome foreign investors into the hotel industry. Our mission is to conduct the most important projects in the Iranian tourism industry for the next five years. The shortage of proper hospitality facilities in the main cities of Iran is the main roadblock for the growth of tourism; for example, more than 70% of the travel requests to Isfahan are rejected every day, as we do not have enough accommodation, which also affects the travel tours.</p><h4>How important is to develop the transport sector to facilitate the growth of tourism? </h4><p>Air transportation is the main way for international tourists to travel to Iran. We should take important decisions to develop the aviation industry, and I was the first to state that Iran should purchase 400 planes for developing tourism. HEGTA has done many studies nationally and internationally to develop this issue and the next step is to develop our own airline, Tamin Air. Along with Istanbul and Dubai, Tehran could be a transportation hub in the region.</p><h4>What are your plans for the year ahead?</h4><p>The next thing that we will do is renovate and construct four- and five-star hotels in cooperation with Accor Group, as we are in the phase of signing the contract. We have many meetings with international hotel groups, investors, and constructors and received proposals for cooperation from numerous companies from throughout the globe and are about to start cooperating with them. Over the coming months, we will start to sign joint ventures with companies we find, which could be the gateway for developing the tourism industry in Iran. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did you come up with the idea of creating a tourism specialized bank?</h4><p>The idea goes back to our founder, Dr. Mehdi Jahangiri. He used to work as a high-ranked official in the Iran Cultural, Handicrafts and Tourism Organization (ICHTO) and decided to establish a private bank specialized in tourism. This was a brilliant idea, as Iran has a vast potential in this field. We are an affiliate member of the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) and, according to its Secretary General, Taleb Rifai, Tourism Bank is the first specialized tourism bank in the world. Although we are a young bank with only six years of operations, we are among the top 100 companies in Iran, specifically the 97th. We have received several awards and credentials for our rapid growth. The mix of young bankers and our competent experienced management team provides us with good  ground to offer attractive services and products to customers.</p><h4>What strategy have you followed to achieve the second highest growth rate in Iran in 2015?</h4><p>Around 70% of our personnel have university degrees as well as doctorates and master's and more than 80% are under 30 years old. On the other hand, our management team is made up of five of the most prominent bankers in the country. In addition to that, deploying high-quality IT facilities has helped us to achieve this fast growth. Our well-spread geographical network is going to increase from 85 to 120 branches, and this will be our ceiling, as we want to promote e-banking in Iran. Our initial capital was USD66 million and is now USD198 million. We are planning to double it this year to USD396 million, which will make Tourism Bank one of the highest paid capital banks in Iran.</p><h4>What is the position of the bank in the international arena?</h4><p>We were the only bank in Iran that was connected to SWIFT during the sanctions, although we were not allowed to do international business. We have just received the license to provide international transactions, so now we can go to the international markets, open letters of credit, and issue foreign guarantees. Last February, we accompanied President Rouhani on his trip to France and Italy, where we met with several European banks. Turkey is also one of the countries that is eager to work with us, and we appreciate its support during the sanctions period. We are open to cooperating with international corporations and we are eager to sign agreements on a win-win basis.</p><h4>How are you supporting the development of the tourism industry within Iran?</h4><p>As part of the Tourism Financial Group, we are the main developers of touristic projects and we build hotels all over the country. We constructed the first airport hotel in Iran at Imam Khomeini International Airport and gave the management to Accor Hotels Group. Within Iran, we are the official agent of ICHTO and the National Development Fund of Iran (NDFI), which means that any tourism project that is going to be implemented in the country is presented to our bank and we can offer special financing to provide appropriate services for the developers. At this moment, about 30 tourism facilities such as hotels or health villages are being constructed across Iran through our financing.</p><h4>What can the tourist card offer to the people who want to visit Iran?</h4><p>The tourist card is a debit card that can be used by Iranians and foreigners. If you open an account at our bank, you will automatically become a member of the Iranian Tourism Club, an affiliated company that offers up to 40% in discounts at shopping centers. With all of the points you collect from your purchases, you will be entitled to take part in seasonal lotteries and you can apply for a travel loan from Tourism Bank for up to USD165,000. The club membership offers free advice on trips, reservations on hotels and flights, and the online purchasing of flight tickets or accommodation inside and outside Iran. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does the JCPOA represent a turning point in the country's goal of attracting 20 million tourists in 2025?</h4><p>After the lifting of sanctions, we entered a new environment in the development of the country with new opportunities ahead. We had a boost in the tourism sector before the beginning of 2016, as we started promoting tourism in Iran in 2013 with the new government of HE Dr. Hassan Rouhani and its approach of cooperation with the world. During the last three years, tourism trends have been increasing in the country, with 30% growth. Iran could achieve a 10% increase in inbound tourism per annum, which is double the world's average of 4.6% growth in this sector. After the P5+1 agreement, the negotiations held with different countries in the past years are reaching more tangible terms and coming to real steps with different companies around the world.</p><h4>How do you assess the appeal of the tourism industry in Iran to attract foreign investment in order to create 400 hotels by 2025?</h4><p>This target has been set in terms of quantity and not quality in order to achieve the goal of 20 million tourists by 2025. Considering Iran's capacity and tourism attractions in terms of cultural, natural, historical, pilgrimage, and health tourism, we are renovating our software and hardware infrastructure. In terms of hardware, we need to promote and develop hotel construction to provide facilities and services for foreign travelers. We need to establish 400 four- and five-star hotels; however, we also need to create one-, two-, and three-star hotels as well as hotel apartments for different economic levels of the society. We are also promoting ecotourism for nature-based tourists who are visiting the country. At the same time, we need to renovate the aviation industry, the railway system, and build new roads to connect the different tourism attractions of Iran. In this regard, some of our monuments need restoration as well.</p><h4>What response have you had so far from foreign investors interested in the development of the Iranian tourism industry?</h4><p>Before the JCPOA signing, we had several negotiations with governmental and semi-governmental companies. After the implementation of the JCPOA, we stepped toward the execution of this agreement with some of them, achieving three tangible deals with two Turkish companies and a German group. We have also received a request from a foreign company in a joint venture with a local partner to establish road complexes and provide all services to pilgrims in 30 points on the route from Azerbaijan to Mashhad. We also have an agreement with another company interested in the renovation and restoration of cultural and historical monuments. Moreover, we are hosting an international conference on investment on the Iranian hotel industry. We invited more than 25 foreign hoteliers and other service providers in the tourism sector to introduce them to some 1,500 projects with an estimated value of USD30 billion envisaged for the next five years.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>Some 5.2 million tourists visited Iran in 2015. In 2016, we expect to have 5.8 million tourists coming to the country, a 10% growth. The new approach of the government toward international relations as well as the safety and security of the country in comparison with the rest of the region are the main reasons for the increase in inbound tourism. Within the next 10 years, we need to have an average annual growth of 7-10% in order to achieve our target. The Travel Agency Association of Iran just reported the average hotel occupancy rate at 70%, and we expect to have the same trend for next year. Next year, we will increase the number of hotels in Iran to provide the required services by benefiting from all capacities available in the country in order to achieve the target we have set for 2025. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess the role of Sharif University in the development of the education system in Iran?</h4><p>Sharif University was founded 50 years ago and has become the leading technical university in Iran and among the best in the Middle East. The latest QS rankings have placed Sharif first in the country for the fourth consecutive year. Sharif graduates have gone on to become outstanding scientists, engineers, and, indeed, leaders worldwide. Our alumni have a presence in over 100 countries worldwide, and Sharif's global character has been shaped through its alumni and body of academic staff, who are pulled from all corners of the globe. We enjoy a unique position in the Iranian higher education system, and that is because our renowned quality of education and research makes us the top destination for undergraduates as well as those who wish to pursue postgraduate study. Of those admitted to Sharif last year, 97 were ranked in the top 100 and 600 were ranked in the top 1,000 in the national university entrance exam of 500,000 participants in physical sciences. Furthermore, Sharif contributes considerably to the country's higher education through its doctoral graduates, who are the prime candidates for faculty positions at top universities across the country. Of the 2,000 PhD graduates, more than 75% are currently faculty members of other universities in Iran.</p><h4>How is Sharif University enhancing its presence in international academia and cooperating with foreign educational and research centers?</h4><p>Internationalization is a high priority on our agenda, and we have thus actively promoted and encouraged international research and educational exchange. For example, Sharif is a member of the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) and has been an active participant in some of the most important experiments, such as the finding of the Higgs' Boson, or God particle. We have a number of joint research projects with L'École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Aalto University, University of Trieste, University of Arizona, UC Davis, and Koç University, to name a few. In addition, Sharif has enjoyed both long-standing joint-degree programs, like the one with the University of Grenoble, and short-term demand-driven ones like a joint executive degree program with the University of Calgary, Canada. We have a number of educational and research exchange programs whereby students and faculty members alike gain international experience and carry out research components, spending sabbaticals abroad. As part of this exchange, we also host international students and faculty in our departments and laboratories. In line with the university's internationalization strategy, we have recently allocated a number of scholarships for full-time international students from the Middle East and Central. In the post-JCPOA era, Sharif has witnessed a surge of interest from international bodies to collaborate with the university. Academic and business delegations visiting Iran have made Sharif their first port of call thanks to our body of alumni, who are well-respected academics and industry leaders worldwide.</p><h4>Is 2016 a turning point for Sharif University's history in the education system?</h4><p>The year 2016 is the 50th anniversary of Sharif University of Technology. The past 50 years have left a deep-rooted legacy in excellence in higher education in our country and the world at large. In order to continue on this path of excellence, we must constantly fine-tune our educational and research programs and retain and hire world-class faculty. In this context, in the 2016-2017 academic year we will implement a five-year strategic plan. The main objectives of the plan are: promoting interdisciplinary education and research; giving students more choices and say in their curriculum and research activities; enhancing the quality of campus life; contributing to the wealth generation in the country through commercialization of knowledge; helping our staff and students to establish knowledge-based start-up companies; and forming strategic partnerships with top universities and research centers across the world. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What makes the IRCS one of the strongest humanitarian societies in the international community?</h4><p>IRCS is one of the largest organizations in the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC). The background of IRCS goes back to more than 94 years in Iran, although the role of the organization has changed over the last nine decades. Before the Islamic Revolution, the role of IRCS was to assist the Iranian society with medical treatment and services. After 1979, we needed to define new responsibilities, such as the disaster response and other emergency situations. Iran is located in a part of the world that is prone to natural disasters. Therefore, the role of IRCS is to respond as a leading agency to all kinds of disasters that take place in the country and also at the international level. Moreover, IRCS has one of the largest numbers of volunteers among global humanitarian national societies. We thank the 2 million volunteers who have helped us provide services to more than 700,000 people over the last three years. At the international level, on many occasions we are present or consulted by international organizations and also act as a key to society in the regional context.</p><h4>What has been your contribution to the health system in Iran?</h4><p>In order to respond to natural disasters, we needed to strengthen ourselves in human resources and logistics issues. This brings me to one of the other missions of IRCS, which is producing medicine and medical equipment. We provide health services both at the national and international levels. Domestically, we are mainly focused on providing rehabilitation services to the people in need with high quality and low prices. Now we are ready to render around 60% of the hemodialysis services in the country. IRCS needs to be presented in the areas where the most vulnerable people are and where the government and the private sectors are not present. Both in the production and distribution of medicines and medical equipment, we need to fill the gaps and shortages in order to be an independent and self-sufficient organization.</p><h4>How do you assess the country's potential to become a health tourism hub in the region?</h4><p>Because of the competent human resources available in Iran, we could be one of the main hubs for medical tourism in the world, providing services to international patients. Both the quality of the services provided and the low fees are the two main areas where we have competencies. Obviously, we can assist the country in this area with our capabilities and international relations. Over the next five years you will hear good news about our medical tourism services. At the same time, wherever we have a physical presence with medical centers, we aim to improve the development of the health system of those countries, especially in Asia and Africa. Moreover, these centers could serve as liaison offices for those patients who would like to be treated in Iran.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>The main objective is to provide training and education in emergency situations and on people's lifestyles. In order to respond to disasters, public education is one of the key areas to save lives, also in prevention and reduction of risks. We are developing a 10-year strategic plan to become a modern learning organization focusing on the resiliency and the advocacy of Iranian society. One of the biggest killers in Iran is road accidents; therefore, we provide lifestyle education to people and increase our role in the health sector. At the same time, being an international organization we have great relations with our international counterparts and are a member of the Governing Board of the IFRC, and are ready to take more responsibility in this international organization. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your competitive position in the Iranian housing market currently?</h4><p>Khanehsazi is part of the Social Security Organization and is the largest housing holding in Iran, with around 5 million sqm constructed. We have 50 years of experience building hospitals across Iran and are the first hospital builder in the Middle East. In fact, more than 40% of healthcare centers in Iran are built by Khanehsazi, as well as many administration offices. One of our best projects is Milad Hospital, a 1,000-bed hospital in Tehran. Currently, we have many projects to construct houses and hospitals. For example, we will build 1,000 homes in Tabriz, 400 in Zanjan, and 195 in Chalus. Khanehsazi is a holding with six subsidiaries that covers the full cycle of operations in the construction sector; Khanehsazi Iran Tarho Ejra Management Co. manages and executes healthcare and administration projects; Khanehsazi Iran Consulting Engineers Co. designs and supervises all kinds of projects; Tamin Gostar Housing and Building Investment Co. constructs mass housing projects; Tasisat &amp; Energy Tamin Engineering Co. supplies and installs the equipment of our projects; Sakha Pishtazan Tamin Maskan Investment Co. constructs mass housing projects; and Abnieh Pishrovan Tamin Industrial Co. produces metal constructions.</p><h4>Have you seen a recovery in the real estate market after the lifting of sanctions?</h4><p>Iran's capacity and volume of building construction is now higher than in previous years. We focus on building small houses for the younger generation as the government has programs to build houses that we will implement. We will use foreign financing in order to build more cheaply and at a larger volume. In addition, we are in talks with hospital builders from Austria, Germany, and South Korea that want to build fifth-grade hospitals in Iran with the latest technology. In Iran, there is a need to rebuild our hospitals and construct more residences, as many of our buildings are old. We need to use foreign materials and knowledge to upgrade construction techniques; at the same time we have a young, highly skilled, and technical workforce.</p><h4>What is your opinion on the urban development of Tehran?</h4><p>Tehran needs to improve in three aspects: commercial areas, hospitals, and residential buildings. We have eight projects in our pipeline to construct malls in Tehran. For the majority of them, we have received the certificates and the land and have done the feasibility studies, so all we need is the financing to start the projects. Secondly, we are ready to build four hospitals ranging between 200 and 600 beds. Finally, we have two types of projects in housing: the first is luxury housing, and in Tabriz we will build four towers of 250 units each. We also seek similar opportunities in Tehran. The second type of housing project is to build between 1 and 5 million small houses for lower-income individuals. However, the problem remains financing, and we will increase cooperation with foreign companies through our organization's affiliated bank, Refah K Bank. Moreover, we plan to enter hotel construction as we have started rebuilding Homa Hotel in Mashhad. Iran is one of the top-10 most attractive countries for tourism; therefore, we have many projects to develop hotels in Tehran and other cities in the country.</p><h4>What are your plans for this year?</h4><p>As our projects are ready, the most important thing now is to get the financing to start construction. We are also developing our capabilities in the green energy sector, such as setting up plants to recycle construction materials. Many buildings in Tehran will need to be renovated in the next 20 years, so it will be important to build these facilities to reduce costs. We also consider getting involved in the transport sector, with the railroads needed and the new lines of subway that are being developed. Finally, we can also start working on underground projects, like parking space construction, which will help ease the traffic in Tehran. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is FKCC's position in the global cement industry?</h4><p>FKCC is one of the holdings under the Social Security Organization, and it is solely active in the cement industry. We own 17 factories with 25 million tons of production capacity per annum. We have two white cement plants, each with a capacity of 500,000 tons per annum. Right now, we produce nine types of cement, and we plan to produce colored cement in the future. With this cement, we manufacture sheets, plates, and other products such as water pipes. We also provide engineering services to our cement companies through other subsidiaries of the holding, and we also have some packaging producer companies and concrete production under our chain. Overall, we are the largest cement producer in Iran, with 32% of the market. Abyek Cement Company, one of our subsidiaries, is the largest cement producer of the Middle East, with a capacity of 16,500 tons per day, over five times more than a regular company. Five of our cement companies are connected to the railroad transportation network, and we also have a terminal for export. In this regard, we export our products to 26 countries around the world and are the 13th-largest cement producer in the world.</p><h4>Which markets are a part of your expansion plans abroad?</h4><p>About 20% of our total production is designated for exports. Following the lifting of sanctions, we started some discussions with foreign companies from Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Georgia, and Iraq for joint ventures and investment. We also had some talks with Pakistan for swapping production, as the northern part exports cement while the south imports. We were negotiating with Lafarge before its merger with Holcim to set up a joint venture in Iran and Iraq. We also export to the Persian Gulf countries, and we are going to establish some agencies in the CIS. We own 42% of the shares of the Export Development Company, while the rest belongs to other cement companies. Its mission is to export Iranian cement to other countries, and we are going to establish five terminals across the country to transport the cement abroad. </p><h4>What is your strategy to raise Iran's position in the world's cement industry?</h4><p>At present, we are focusing on building common brand standards for all our companies. The total capacity of the country of 80 million tons per annum is expected to increase to 102 million tons this year. Since 2014, Iran has been the fourth largest cement producer in the world after China, India, and the US. At present, 85% of the total machinery and equipment for cement is produced locally, and before now most of the machinery and equipment was imported from Europe.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>The rise of the cement market is directly related to economic growth, so we have a good vision for the future year regarding the 5% forecasted GDP growth. We also expect a better situation in Syria and Yemen, because our neighboring countries will soon see an end to the wars, and they are good markets for us. The government should start giving us some assistance or subsidies for transporting the cement all around the world, because right now the transportation fee is a bit high. Moreover, we are the first holding in Iran that is focused on preserving the environment and to receive a green industry certificate. All the companies located in different parts of the country are monitored every day to make sure they comply with environmental standards. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Tipax evolved over its 55-year history to its current leading position in the Iranian courier market?</h4><p>My father established Tipax 55 years ago as a courier service covering a wide range of activities. As a result of the war with Iraq, some of the services we were offering could not be done privately and passed over to the government's hands. Moreover, our activities abroad were interrupted; 35 years ago we had international branches in London, Frankfurt, and Dubai; however, we had to close them down as we were unable to operate internationally. However, with the lifting of sanctions the doors for Iran and for Tipax are opening. Currently, we are the biggest private courier company in Iran, with 200 branches across the country and 3,000 staff. In order to grow as a holding we are diversifying our activities. First, we started two years ago in the retail business managing three brands in Iran: Lion of Porches, Pepe Jeans, and Pablosky. We are also active in the decoration and furniture industry, mainly office equipment, and are now entering the e-commerce market. </p><h4>How important is it for Tipax to have an extensive global network of branches abroad and connect with foreign counterparts?</h4><p>It is part of our strategy to expand to other countries by opening branches. We were able to choose our partners and become international 35 years ago, and now we have the opportunity to move abroad again. We have been signing contracts and partnering with foreign counterparts and are also in talks with European courier services to bring them to Iran and to be our partner in Europe. However, we are not just looking at Europe; at the end of this year, we are going to open a new office in Dubai. The Middle East is definitely another region that we are focusing right now. </p><h4>How do you assess the competition in the courier market in Iran?</h4><p>Although there is a lot of competition in the market, Tipax has maintained its leading position for 55 years because we have the trust of Iranian society. People rely on our services, which is our main advantage in comparison to other local or foreign competitors. We provide the fastest courier services in Iran; our price, speed, and accuracy are our three main strengths. Looking at our portfolio, half of our clients are from the general public, while the other half belongs to the business community. In this sense, we do not target any specific sector. Tipax is currently one of the few logistic hubs in Iran, and we are concentrating on modernization more than before. We are conscious of the strategic position this country has in the Middle East to connect Europe and Asia and are going to benefit from it after the lifting of sanctions.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>We expect much more after the signing of the JCPOA with regard to the ambitious plans the country has for the future. However, I am sure that next year will be much better to do business and Tipax is drafting a plan for this. We will expand outside of Iran by opening an office in Dubai and other branches in Europe and the Middle East. The plan is to have more than 500 branches and to increase our staff to 5,000 people in the courier service. The final objective is to become an international courier service that can compete among the top five in the world with well-known companies like DHL, FedEx, or TNT. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Iran aims to become a land bridge connecting Asia and Europe. What is the importance of developing an extensive railway network to boost trade with foreign countries?</h4><p>Iran is in an excellent position geographically whereby it can not only connect Asia with Europe, but also CIS countries with the Persian Gulf. We focus on using our location as a bridge to connect all sides. We have some connections currently running from north to south. We have a rail connection from Bandar Abbas going into Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan. In 2015, we added a new connection from Sarakhs in the east of Iran that goes through Turkmenistan and directly into Kazakhstan. We have one rail connection with Turkey from the Razi border. Now, we are constructing a new North-South Rail Corridor to link Iran to Azerbaijan and Russia. We are also constructing a new line to Herat in Afghanistan. We have completed the work up to the border and are now doing the construction work on the Afghan side, which Iran is also paying for. By 2016, the work will be done and then we have major plans to develop the railway further to connect to other countries. We plan to connect with Iraq on two sides, one on the southwest of Iran through Khorramshahr to Basra, with only 35km left to go before completing this line. We have signed an MoU with the government of Iraq to build a bridge to complete that connection. We have another plan to connect with Iraq through Khosravi border in the west of Iran to Baghdad, which is over 70km. We plan to link up with all our neighboring countries and can then play a better role in this network of connections.</p><h4>Iran plans to develop a 12,000km rail network. What is your strategy to attract foreign investment for this project?</h4><p>For infrastructure, we look at using finance through tenders and not direct investment, as it is difficult to engage foreign investors in infrastructure projects. Our typical strategy is to use loans from foreign countries to finance projects. Of the intended USD25 billion, we plan for a maximum of USD10 billion to come from foreign investors as direct investment for operational activities and the rail fleet. For this reason, we plan to have attractive packages for investors of the fleet. For example, we will provide free infrastructure to all the operators for a number of years. This means that if a company invests in freight cars today, it will not pay any taxes for using any of the rail infrastructures for four years. Similarly, if investors bring locomotives here to use on our lines, Railways of Iran (RAI) will give them a guarantee to buy their services. However, there are some exceptions. For example, for the Rasht-Astara railway project, which is part of North-South Corridor to link Iran and Azerbaijan, we look to invite foreign investors as it is more useful for transit and they can use foreign currency income.</p><h4>In February, the first train on the Silk Road arrived from China. What is the importance of this project for Iran?</h4><p>This new corridor is important because Iran has a good relationship with China. Businessmen in Iran import a substantial number of goods from China. Currently, they use shipping lines for this, usually from Shanghai to Bandar Abbas Port. This new railway line is important because it will reduce transportation costs, which will attract traders to use rail to transport goods from China to Iran and on to Europe. The first train was successful, and it took around 14 days from Yiwu to Tehran. We hope to have more trains and expand this service in the future, for example with more trains to Turkey and directly to Europe. Turkey is building new bridges on the Bosporus that can be used for both road and rail. This would create a complete railway line from China to Iran and then to Turkey and Europe. </p>]]></richbody0content>

After a national tender in 2009, he was awarded a WiMAX license in Golestan province and received 3.5GHz frequency. In 2010, through a privatization process, Miri acquired DGA and rebranded it as HiWEB, which started as a national ADSL service provider. He then bid for Trunk license in 2014 and received first a 450MHz frequency and later 1.9GHz. Miri’s goal was to turn HiWEB into a mobile operator, and in 2015 he won a national tender for rural broadband (USO) to launch mobile services in Iran.]]></intervieweelist0description>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does HiWEB differentiate itself in the ICT market?</h4><p>We try to make a difference in two fields. The first one is our contribution to the Universal Service Obligation (USO), a project financed by the government to promote internet services in remote and rural areas. As other operators do not work in these areas because they do not generate enough revenues, the government selected us to provide data access to 25,000 villages. Our second advantage is our fixed-wireless broadband services. There are around 8 million subscribers of ADSL services in Iran, and the government will provide 13 new licenses for operators. We expect to receive this new license in one year and establish a consortium with five other companies. The infrastructure and towers have been installed before; therefore, it means that within three or four months after receiving the license, we will be able to launch our network. Currently, there are three mobile operators in Iran. This consortium will be the fourth wireless access provider in the country and will enable customers to reach speeds of 20MB/s or higher.</p><h4>How will your position in the ICT market develop in the coming years amidst greater competition?</h4><p>There are many licenses and players in the Iranian market but most of them do not in fact have enough customers and are not able to gain more. There are only five or six operators with enough experience to succeed in this market. In fixed-broadband services, there are around 3-4 million subscribers in total; therefore, some players will come together as one company to increase their market share. I am pleased to say that after nine months of negotiations, we signed a contract with Vodafone to be its exclusive partner in Iran. Foreign operators trying to join the market must purchase or cooperate with an Iranian operator. Having different types of licenses, either low-band or high-band frequencies, is actually our core competency in comparison to other Iranian companies. A variety of frequencies is important for the implementation of 5G technology.</p><h4>How does HiWEB adapt to the challenging mission of providing Internet services in Iran?</h4><p>The reason why internet speed is slow in Iran is due to three problems: access, transmission, and cost. The Iranian government is not interested in increasing speed; therefore, the solution is to house content in-country. The government prefers to have content generated locally, which is why new internet service providers are based on this policy. In this regard, we will have a partnership with international content providers. For transmission, we plan to launch our fiber network in our consortium and aim to provide reliable and cheaper internet services for our subscribers. Our prediction is that by the end of the next Iranian year, people will be able to have access to high-speed internet. Statistics show that internet consumption has grown eight-fold compared to the previous year, and the main reason was the increase in speed. Right now, the average consumption is 12GB per month, while in western countries it reaches 60GB. This shows a direct relation between consumption and speed, so offering 20MB/s next year will be a good start.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>Multinationals have shown interest in the Iranian market because of its young population and large number of users. Being the exclusive partner of one of prominent international operators in Iran will definitely be an advantage on our side. We would be able to provide its services to foreign users and international companies coming to Iran. Our growth increased four-fold this year, and we predict it will continue this way. In 2016, we have mobile broadband and are considering getting voice services and offering MBNO services to offer a complete solution for our customers. Moreover, my forecast for the market is that in the near future one big company will purchase all the small companies and will work in a form of consortium leading the Iranian ICT market. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are Golgohar's current amibitions for the industrial and mining sectors?</h4><p>There are more than 1 billion tons of iron ore to be exploited in Golgohar mines. We believe that by exploring new areas we can increase this quantity, and, thus, are negotiating with the Ministry of Industry, Mine, and Trade to extend our explorations area. We expect to produce more than 16 million tons of iron products this year based on the Persian calendar. At the moment, we produce 5 million-ton of iron plates, and in the middle of the year we will start a new 5 million tons line. At the same time, we are developing a new line of direct reduction iron (DRI) to produce 2.5 million tons. At the end of the year, we will have increased iron production by 68%. Our melt shop is also under construction and will produce 1 million tons of steel billets by the end of next year. Furthermore, we will finalize our contract for producing 3 million tons of thin slabs with one of the most reputable companies in the European market. We also have a power plant with a capacity of 500 MW to supply energy for our factories. Last but not least, we are currently conducting one the largest projects in Iran, which consists of carrying water from the Persian Gulf to dry areas in the south of Iran. This project is a joint venture with the National Iranian Copper Industries (NICICO) and Chadormalu Mining &amp; Industrial Company. The first phase of this 300km-pipeline project has been completed with the construction of the first 120km.</p><h4>Which markets do you target for exporting your products?</h4><p>The main customer of iron concentrate is China, whereas the best markets for Direct-reduced iron (DRI) are Europe and Turkey. That is why after the lifting of sanctions we seek to cooperate with European firms. We also have a great relationship with Persian Gulf countries such as Oman, where we have recently opened an office. The most important project to increase our exports consists of developing a railway system to transport our products from Golgohar to Bandar Abbas port. After the visit of President Hassan Rouhani to the mines earlier this year, we signed an agreement with Railways of Iran (RAI) to start a 200km-railway project between Sirjan and Kerman, which will connect Bandar Abbas to this area. We can proudly say we are the first private company conducting a railway project in Iran. For this purpose, we have established a company that has already bought 10 locomotives. We are looking for joint ventures to finance this railway project.</p><h4>Is developing projects outside of Iran also part of your company's strategy?</h4><p>We are ready to develop mine projects in Afghanistan. In fact, we started negotiating with the Afghan government and held a meeting in Iran. We are studying the mines located near the borders of both countries, which is also a great area for transportation. We will visit the mines soon for further discussions. Moreover, we bought a copper mine in Kazakhstan, which is now under development to produce copper.</p><h4>How do you assess your appeal in attracting foreign investment into the iron ore chain?</h4><p>We are eager to cooperate with foreign companies in the iron and steel production chains. The iron market globally has decreased; therefore, we have to make sure that everything is under control in order to remain profitable for our shareholders' benefits. For this reason, we have been increasing production in our factories and we had a successful commissioning in our last projects. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the appeal of your products for the automotive industry in light of recent agreements between European and Iranian car manufacturers?</h4><p>Europe and other international markets certainly welcome Mobarakeh's products because our products comply with international standards. Representatives from Citroí«n and Peugeot recently came to the factory to assess our production line and confirmed our quality for manufacturing cars. We are a permanent supplier of steel to both Saipa and Iran Khodro, Iran's largest car manufacturers. In addition, we supply our products for the manufacture of all household appliances, the oil and gas industry, as well as flat products for pipe mills. The government has set up a plan to reach 55 million tons of steel production by 2025. In this regard, our intention is to retain half of the market share, which will mean increasing our production capacity to 22 million tons per annum by that time. To reach that goal, we have set up a plan to expand our existing facilities and establish new plants in different areas of the country. Regarding our basket of products, we want to continue with flat steel products and also diversify into other qualities and product shapes. We invest in equipment to manufacture cleaner steel, which the automobile industry is calling for, as well as gas pipelines and other industries.</p><h4>Iran is opening up to the world. How is Mobarakeh leading this new era with its activities abroad?</h4><p>We did not have problems exporting during the sanctions because our products were not subject to sanctions and there was a big demand by European, Middle East, and Southeast Asian customers. In fact, we were limited on our side, because we also had to supply the local market and could not allocate all our production for exports. Currently, around 35% of our production is exported, and 65% is dedicated to meeting domestic demand. During the sanctions, we faced some difficulties conducting transactions and sending and receiving funds but have overcome these problems now. Today, after the P5+1 agreement, we are free to do our business without an intermediate party. We can talk face-to-face to international clients and look for new markets. Competition is determined by quality and by the price. In 2015, steel producers all over the world had the worst conditions in the history of the steel industry, as prices fell by 50% and still have not recovered completely. Nevertheless, we remain in a good position in the world market, competing with European and Asian producers.</p><h4>What role will Iran play in the international arena by becoming a steel hub in the world?</h4><p>The target of the government for 2025 is to become a hub for producing steel in the region. There are only a few countries in the world like Iran that have all the resources available. We have iron ore and energy, and as we produce our steel with traditional blast furnace or arc furnace, we also have the electricity, natural gas, and coal needed for the furnaces. In addition, we have a young, educated workforce and the know-how and technology to develop steel plants. Iran is a great nation with a huge population and great potential</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>The government has plans to reach around 8% growth within a few years. I am optimistic that with the opening of business to world markets, a great deal of new investment will come to Iran. Reaching the 8% growth goal is not an ambitious target; it is something that will happen. Mobarakeh will try to continue to grow with our own resources and expand our internal income. If we need to attract financing for our projects, we prefer to use foreign funds because the rates are cheaper and it is more economically convenient. However, if there are foreign investors interested in investing in our production plants, they could join us as partners in existing plants or to develop new plants. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Going  to Market]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[going-to-market]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Henkel adapted to the needs and demands specific to the Iranian market?</h4><p>We have done a great deal of work in this regard. A lack of insight regarding Iranian consumers was one of the key challenges we had at the beginning. What is clear is that Iranian consumers' demands are extremely specific and quite advanced. It took a couple of years to get the right information and put a consumer profile description in place. Iranian consumers have high expectations because they have been accustomed to high-quality products at accessible prices for decades. This means there is demand, which is good to know for the companies that really mean business. </p><h4>How does Henkel support the government's vision of reducing imports and increasing local production to export to the region?</h4><p>Henkel is probably one of the best examples of support for this vision. We have invested a great deal in local production. Even before and during the sanctions, we managed to produce locally pretty much everything we sell here. Our ratio of imported goods and raw materials for production was less than 10% per annum; almost everything we invested was for local production. We also have an active export business in the traditional Iranian export markets of neighboring countries. In fact, we could have had an even better export business over the last few years; however, due to certain limitations in our production capacity we could not serve all the existing demand. We are fixing this by increasing the capacity of our factories and enhancing our exports. We consider the government's vision when conducting our business and try to support our local partners with similar goals.</p><h4>What would be your advice to foreign companies looking to enter the Iranian market?</h4><p>It is important for prospective companies not to make the assumption that because Iran is part of the Middle East, whatever works in other parts of the region will work here as well. I would not recommend starting a business until companies do their homework properly. That requires time and money, and for companies that expect to have a successful business quickly, they should know that this is not an easy market to conquer. There is also is another reality for most foreign investors coming to Iran; they might think there is little or no competition here. Although local manufacturers may not be experienced in regional or global markets, they are extremely good at producing top quality products at good prices. They are also quite aggressive in local distribution and marketing campaigns. Competition here is different, but nevertheless strong. This is one of the reasons why some large companies are still not present in the Iranian market, despite the lifting of sanctions. They have probably realized this is not an easy nut to crack.</p><h4>Is 2016 a turning point for Henkel's operations in Iran?</h4><p>For the last five years or so, every year has been a turning point for us here. One of the challenging aspects of working in Iran is that everything can change quite dramatically. I expect to see an increase in investments. Demand will start to recapture some of the losses from the last two or three years, which were quite significant in terms of volume. However, that will probably take another year or more. I look forward to increased competition because it will help educate consumers more about product quality and differentiation. I am optimistic; in general, I try to promote the Iranian economy and opportunities because it is an amazing country. Iran's economy has a strong foundation, and I admire the fact that even the harsh sanctions were unable to shake the fundamentals of the country's economy and industry. There is a large, highly qualified workforce here, the industry is diversified, and there is great potential in the domestic market. These are powerful incentives for companies that come here for long-term business, not just for short-term gains. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been the role of IDRO in the development of the industrial sector?</h4><p>IDRO was established in 1967 after the country began to industrialize. It is an organization with a long history that has played a major role in improving and promoting industry in Iran. This organization started to work 50 years ago when there was no industry in Iran, and now we have seen just how this sector has grown. We have conducted many projects that can be divided into two parts: industrial development and the expansion of organizations. IDRO supports the private sector and takes part in a maximum of 20% of its projects or activities, so companies remain completely private. In addition, as the government is supporting knowledge-based companies, we focus on technological companies that need financing, do not know the market, or have management problems. The third thing we do is training and education for managers through the Industrial Management Institute (IMI), one of our subsidiaries. IMI is responsible for educating world-class managers and is negotiating with five world-recognized business scholars and universities. Finally, we also do company restructuring, mostly for medium and small businesses with liquidity and management problems. Based on the laws of the country, the government takes control of the company and gives it to IDRO, and we have a responsibility to help them.</p><h4>What are the main sectors where you focus your activities?</h4><p>Based on my experience as Deputy Minister of Petroleum, one of IDRO's biggest priorities is the oil and gas sector. We have conducted many good negotiations with foreign companies to cooperate at the same level. We do not want foreign companies to just come and sell their products in Iran. For example, we negotiated with Citroí«n to sign a joint venture with Saipa. Citroí«n would bring hard currency, and Saipa the location, heavy equipment, and human resources. Based on this joint venture, Saipa will produce a new model of Citroí«n to be sold in the local market and export 40% of the production. In the petrochemicals sector, we negotiated with German companies to sign an agreement and establish huge complexes. According to our policies in all sectors, foreign companies cannot bring finished products and have to cooperate with local companies to produce in Iran.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the growth of industry in the post-sanctions era?</h4><p>After the sanctions, there is a great opportunity for Iran to grow. We try to look forward and not think about the past anymore. I am optimistic and certain that European countries will encourage their companies to come to Iran. Less than five months after the signing of the JCPOA, many foreign companies came to invest in Iran and some have signed important agreements. In one year, we will solve many problems, as European banks get over their fear of investing and trading with Iran. Europe is the most interesting and biggest market for our country. It has to understand the abilities of our country, our deep cultural values, and our young and well-educated society. Iran is completely different from the nearby countries in the Middle East.</p><h4>What are your expectations for this year?</h4><p>We have enough time until the end of the Iranian year to achieve our goals. We will continue to focus on the oil and gas market, including railway and shipping line transportation. We have one of the biggest companies for ship manufacturing in the Middle East, called Iran Shipbuilding &amp; Offshore Industries Complex Co (ISOICO). We signed an agreement with our users, the National Iranian Tanker Company (NITC) and the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines (IRISL), to establish a joint venture to send tankers to foreign countries, mainly India and Europe. We are also negotiating with European shipping lines for ship manufacturing. Moreover, IDRO has a good chance of participating in IPC contracts with foreign companies to develop Iranian reserves. We also have four tire and rubber companies with a capacity of 50,000 tons per annum and are now investing USD5.6 million in its expansion. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What changes are you expecting to see in the sector this year?</h4><p>First of all, Iran has not changed; it is the same ministry, the same policy, and the same country. This change is only because of political matters; the external image of Iran depicted us as looking for nuclear weapons and so on. However, finally, after long-term negotiations, people understood the facts. We are here to cooperate with countries that have displayed an eagerness to cooperate. We seek long-term, strategic cooperation. If someone wants to sell their goods and leave, we are not here for this. We have plenty of production inside the country. Even in medicine, we produce 97% of total consumption. In the car industry and many other industries, most of the goods are produced in Iran for domestic use and some for export. We seek long-term cooperation, including joint investment and engineering cooperation, R&amp;D, HR, technical, commercial, export, top management, and so on. It will be a joint cooperation. We have something to give and they will have something to give.</p><h4>How is the ministry trying to promote economic ties with the EU?</h4><p>We believe each of these countries have their specialties. They have good or competitive conditions in certain areas. For example, Italy and Germany are industrial countries, and we believe Germany has five or six areas for cooperation. We have information and history that shows there are certain countries with certain areas that are more cooperative. We look forward to determining the companies on their side that are qualified and then matching them with our companies. The government will not do business; we have to make general policies so they can work together. If we want to expand business, banking relations are a priority. This is why companies bring their bankers here to talk with our banks about cooperating again. For investment, Iran needs export credit agencies to support investors. We all have to find ways to restart cooperation. We have to exchange information. It will take some time to build this.</p><h4>Iran recently announced plans to cooperate with China to contract an industrial park for petrochemicals, aluminum, and steel. Will this project help trade relations with other Asian countries?</h4><p>At times Europeans think Iran's relationship with Asian countries will hurt its relationship with European countries. However, Iran is large enough to have cooperation with all of these companies. We are not going to cut ties with big industrial, growing countries like China or Russia. They have some advantages that we need to utilize. For example, in infrastructure, there is greater capacity in China. They conduct large projects, activities, and their processes are competitive, so why not cooperate? We are just continuing our previous cooperation as well as starting new cooperation. This government is looking for a good, long-lasting relationship with all the countries and it will not happen unless we can make it a win-win for all sides.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the mining sector?</h4><p>Last year we invested about USD3 billion in steel complexes. There were sanctions in place and we did not have many financing options, but we still did it in one year. By 2025, we look to reach a minimum of 50 million tons of steel. Some of the projects are already under construction. Some will start operations in the coming years. We have domestic growth and this is a situation where we can supply steel to our neighboring countries. Of this 50 million tons, we believe a minimum of 10 million tons will be exported. This year we will produce a minimum 18 million tons of steel, but there are many different stages. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the fields where Hatami &amp; Associates has a competitive advantage over other law firms in Iran?</h4><p>Hatami &amp; Associates has consulted with Iranian and non-Iranian clients in different fields. These fields include a wide range of international trade and investment subjects. As a result of our valuable practical experience and expertise in miscellaneous fields, we supply legal services with the highest level of quality to several entities. In oil and gas, this law firm has a deep background in providing legal services in the upstream sector for well-known international oil companies and also oil services companies. The other sector is malls and hotels, as Hatami &amp; Associates consults for the Iran Mall Complex, Farmaneih Mall, and its hotels with respect to their construction, management, operating, franchising, joint-venture, distribution, M&amp;A activities, and all other aspects of corporate law. We have also provided legal consultancy services for renewable energy, power plants, infrastructure projects, and refineries. </p><h4>What are the main difficulties foreign companies might encounter when doing business in Iran?</h4><p>Generally speaking, legal, political, economic, administrative, and monitoring deficiencies are the problems that undermine the activities of foreign companies in Iran, and thus increase the risk level for these companies. The most important problems are that some laws and regulations are not comprehensive, transparent, or supportive. It is also important to consider the political conditions and the negative effects of numerous sanctions. Moreover, the instability of laws, policies, and short-term governmental programs add to the already inefficient administrative and executive systems. Finally, the lengthy and ineffective dispute resolution procedures within the judicial system represent another difficulty for foreign firms. However, Hatami &amp; Associates has a long background in providing legal services to foreign clients engaging in international commerce or looking for investment opportunities in Iran. We have a wide range of knowledge and valuable experience in the various laws and regulations in different fields and the administrative and legal processes and deficiencies in Iran. Therefore, we can accurately interpret the legal provisions and aid in ongoing legal procedures. In this line, this law firm has efficiently been able to apply its knowledge and experience in drafting, negotiating, and finalizing contractual documents.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the maturity of the Iranian legal infrastructure for attracting foreign investment after the lifting of sanctions?</h4><p>After sanctions were imposed, the volume of foreign investment in Iran considerably decreased and depression emerged in various core business areas. With the gradual lifting of sanctions, commercial negotiations have commenced with numerous foreign delegates who are interested in entering Iran's untouched markets to start a profitable business. Iranian legislation has embarked on regulating new rules and modifying existing regulations to facilitate and attract foreign investment, while giving priority to the oil and gas, mining, and renewable energy sectors. For example, newly enacted regulations in the oil and gas industry reflect the desire and flexibility of the Iranian legal system to attract foreign investment. All in all, there are some measures that should be taken by Iranian legislation that could result in an attractive market for doing business: transparency, privatization across different sectors, the ratification of international conventions, and infrastructural partnerships between local and foreign investors.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>Considering the significant changes in the political atmosphere, namely the lifting of sanctions and the electoral wins by reformers in parliament, together with the semi-stabilization of economic conditions and newly enacted and reformed regulations, we expect diverse and fruitful opportunities for foreign companies entering the Iranian market in different sectors such as oil and gas, mining, renewable energy, petrochemicals, industry, construction, and more. With regard to this fact, we intend to increase the number of our employees in our different departments in order to meet the requirements of future clients in a prompt and efficient way. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Iran's potential for becoming an energy hub for the region?</h4><p>The Middle East is an important region for energy in the world. Especially in Iran, due to its stability throughout history and even now, we are a great source of energy, even to produce and distribute to the region. With improving technology, it is easy for Iran to trade with electricity, either to the Far East or the Far West. Instead of selling crude energy like oil and gas, we can transfer it to electricity and distribute it to foreign countries. In this recent age, one of the safest investments in the world is investing in energy, especially in electricity, which could have lots of added value for the countries. We want the world to look at this point and understand the ability of the Iranian economy and the political stability of the country as well. We now have 75,000MW production of electricity from installed power plants, whereas our neighboring countries do not have more than 25,000MW capacity. We can create a network to distribute electricity even to CIS and some European countries.</p><h4>What kind of products and services does SUNIR offer?</h4><p>SUNIR is planning to produce 100,000MW from renewable resources for exporting and trading. We have seven fields of activities, exporting industrial and engineering services, trading with electricity, and financing projects within Iran. One is producing power plants, combined cycles, dams, solar, and wind farms. The second is electricity transmission and sub-stations. The third is creating the distribution network in villages and urban and industrial complexes. We also build petrochemical plants and refineries, as well as water sewage plants and pipelines. Finally, we also operate in the construction and mining sectors.</p><h4>What capabilities does Iran have to make it a world leader in the engineering services sector?</h4><p>All of the countries in the world, in order to improve economy and progress, should reach the position that Iran has in this sector. We implemented policies 20 years ago that have made us better every year. Our vision for 2021 is to be an energy hub. We should be the best energy source for the Middle East and distribute to the other market targets, like Europe, North America, China, and India. We have two options: produce energy and export, or exchange crude oil and gas energy by electricity. Electricity can be transmitted and traded easily, whereas oil and gas need more assets for transporting, and SUNIR has great capabilities to transmit electricity.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>We had USD25 billion in negotiations this year, except for our megaprojects, of which USD7.8 billion are under agreements. We hope to reach an agreement around USD5 billion before the end of this year. Recently, we had a meeting with the President of Kazakhstan, who offered us one package of around USD800 million to build two out of the 27 wind farms they want to establish, and we are now studying the project. For civil section, we are now studying a 1,200km road construction in the east of the Caspian Sea and 300km of mining. With these projects, we can easily reach USD800 million in two or three months. In Armenia, we have a large transmission line under construction, which will connect the Georgian and Russian network to Iran. In the meantime, we are negotiating to make a joint network with Turkmenistan. In the Persian Gulf, we have three projects, two in Oman for transmission lines and another sub-marine transmission line from Iran to the UAE. When we operate in any country, we produce electricity for them or repair their network, such as Oman, where we have produced a pipeline for sewage and made a road. Therefore, we can work in any country, as SUNIR wants to be considered a symbol of welfare and peace. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Slice of the Pie]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[slice-of-the-pie]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the competitive position of Razi Insurance among private insurers in Iran?</h4><p>Since 2002, we have issued around 12 million insurance policies and currently hold a 4% market share, insuring 2.5 million people. Since our establishment, some 25 other private insurers have been set up as well; however, in most of these cases their shareholders are institutions related to the government. Currently, there are only two or three insurance companies in Iran that are 100% private, and Razi Insurance is one of them. Another difference is that our income does not come from the shareholders; 99.5% of our business comes from our customers. We are a general insurance company active in health, life, liability, engineering, projects, construction, and automobile insurance, where most of our policies are focused; however, we also insure numerous oil and gas projects, such as the Azadegan oil field, the largest oil field in Iran.</p><h4>The Central Insurance of Iran is adapting some policies to modernize the insurance market, including separating life and non-life business. How is Razi Insurance planning to adapt to these changes?<br></h4><p>The law on third party liability (TPL) automobile insurance was passed 50 years ago, and is still the most important segment of the insurance industry accounting for 50% of the total premiums in Iran. Life insurance has not had that big of a share of the insurance business, but it is a growing business with a 7% share of all premiums written. Its growth will depend on how insurance companies can introduce new products. Another important factor would be if European insurers decide to enter the market, making the market grow up to 9%, but not to the level of countries like Japan. If the regulator decides to separate life and non-life business, we are ready to divide our company into two to meet this requirement. </p><h4>Is it part of your strategy to expand across the region?</h4><p>We are preparing a business plan for developing our regional expansion. We are looking at neighboring countries, such as Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as countries in the north, particularly the CIS countries. We want to establish branches in the region and are already talking to some of these countries, although their rules are different; in some of them we will be able to open a branch but in others you have to set up a new insurance company.</p><h4>How do you see the future development of the insurance market in Iran?</h4><p>Iran is an excellent market from an insurance point of view. There are many differences between Iran and other Middle Eastern countries; for example, in many Islamic countries conventional insurance is forbidden and only takaful insurance services can be issued. However, in Iran and Turkey, conventional insurance is not forbidden, and this is why we are the second-largest insurance industry in the MENA region. Moreover, Iran has a population of 80 million, being the second-largest country in the MENA region in terms of population and extension. Furthermore, Iran has the second-largest gas reserves in the world and the third-largest oil reserves. In this regard, the insurance industry plays an important role in the oil and gas sector, and this is why we will play an even larger role going forward than in previous years.</p><h4>What are your objectives for the year ahead?</h4><p>One of our objectives is to grow our market share by 0.5% annually. Our goal for 2016 was to have a 3.5% market share, but we have achieved 4% already. Due to the increase in the number of private insurers in Iran and the decrease in the presence of the in the sector, by 2022, the insurance company with 7% of market share will be the largest insurance company in Iran. Our goal is to be the first insurance company in the country in terms of market share and number of premiums. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In 2001, private insurance companies were authorized in Iran. How do you assess the development of the Iranian insurance market toward fair and healthy competition?</h4><p>After the Islamic Revolution, because of the nationalization of the insurance industry, we only had four public insurance companies; however, in the 1990s we decided to open the market by privatizing the existing state-owned companies. Still, it would have been a better idea to allow new insurance players into the market. At that time, the government started to liberalize the industry by taking away the tariff system and also by creating compulsory insurance through Bimeh Markazi, controlling 25% of the market for non-life and 50% for life insurance. In the first instance, at the beginning of the 21st Century, we gave licenses to 10 insurance companies. Today, there are 30 private insurance companies in Iran, and there are some new applications coming up; therefore, we may add one or two more companies in the near future.</p><h4>How will the lifting of sanctions transform the insurance industry in Iran?</h4><p>The main problem the Iranian insurance industry faced over recent years was sanctions. Nowadays, the high competition is affecting the financial performance of the players, but the end of sanctions represents a new era for business. We will have 5% GDP growth in 2016 with the development of the transport, energy, and other sectors, and all these sectors require the support of the insurance industry. It is expected that Iran's life and non-life insurance business will be worth USD8 billion in 2016. I have been contacted by main foreign insurance companies, including European ones, which are interested in having shares or joint ventures with our insurance companies. We at Bimeh Markazi are doing our best to sort out the rating problem with reinsurance companies. Last June, Fitch came to Tehran to discuss the issue with us. This will help the insurance industry to have inward business, but this requires a great relationship with major players in the region, Europe, and other areas of the world. Overall, I am optimistic for the post-sanctions era.</p><h4>What initiatives are you implementing to open up the market to foreign insurers and reinsurers?</h4><p>According to the national laws and regulations, foreign companies can hold up to a 49% interest in our insurance companies with government and Bimeh Markazi's approval. The entry of new foreign players could improve the penetration rate of the insurance industry in the country. However, we need to set the right premiums for domestic companies to stay afloat. The fierce competition over the last decade damaged some Iranian insurers and we have to support them to recover. While policyholders do benefit from strong competition and the resulting low premiums, this has to be proportional to keep the business profitable for the companies. Experienced foreign companies coming into the market will apply the right rates, and they will help to develop the Iranian market toward healthy competition.</p><h4>What are the main initiatives Bimeh Markazi will be introducing to the market in 2016?</h4><p>The first initiative is developing the life insurance segment. The second is to promote the coverage for the increasing business activities starting up post-sanctions, such as protection and indemnity (P&amp;I) for oil cargo companies. Iran has two P&amp;I insurance companies, which want to connect with foreign reinsurers, and we are developing a plan to satisfy the needs of this increasing business in post-sanctions. The third important matter is supporting the domestic insurance companies, as our mandate is to supervise the industry but also support it. We provide training and experts to help the players grow and facilitate international relationships. Furthermore, it will be interesting for us to look at the effect of the end of sanctions in five years' time. We are working hard to develop the industry and to develop an insurance culture in Iranian society by raising public awareness. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the bank's status after completing its Five-Year Strategic Plan?</h4><p>We are a relatively young bank with only 17 years of experience. However, we are also among the oldest private-sector banks established after the 1979 revolution. In order to compete with state-owned banks that are more than 80 years old and have 3,000 branches all over the country, Saman Bank started its operations by concentrating on electronic banking services and opening a limited number of branches in strategic locations. We maintain our position as being the pioneering bank in e-banking. That was the bank's strategy until 2008, when sanctions began to be imposed on the country's banking sector. Since 2008, Saman has been focused on corporate banking and expanded its network of international correspondent banks. I am proud to say that the reputation of Saman Bank, particularly in the international arena, is excellent. We are well known internationally and have a strong reputation among European and non-European banks thanks to being at the forefront in implementing our AML and compliance units as well as the quality of our services offered. Wherever we go, we are well known. For example, when I went to Vienna to meet a number of Austrian banks, they are keen to expand their operations with us and start a business relationship. We have noticed that European banks are interested in cooperating with Iranian banks, especially with Saman Bank, now that the limitations created by the sanctions, particularly for correspondent banking relationships, are over to a great extent.</p><h4>How do you assess the value of your Investment Advisory Services for domestic companies to develop international trade?</h4><p>We offer trade-financing services to the major companies in Iran. The most important part of our activities during the last six years has been focused on domestic companies involved in basic commodities, as well as pharmaceuticals firms that import raw materials from overseas and deal with major producers such as Bayer or Novartis. In fact, 40% of pharmaceuticals products and approximately 20% of basic commodities imported to Iran are handled by Saman Bank. During the last six years, we have financed an average of USD5.5 billion of trade volume per annum. We will increase this volume of business, at least along the line of expertise that we have got experience in, but also for industries interested in our services. Moreover, we have designated a special branch exclusively to support SME exports from Iran. We offer various lines of credit and we create export financing for companies that need to buy, prepare, and arrange the shipping of goods. If they are exporting their goods to various companies in the long term, we can finance their shipping documents, discount their bills, lend to them, and wait for the maturity of the exchange to collect benefits from it.</p><h4>What markets are you targeting to expand your network abroad? </h4><p>First of all, we will establish offices in Europe. I am happy to say that we have received a license from the Central Bank of Italy to open a representative office in Rome, which will be operative soon. We also met the Italian Export Credit Agency (SACE) when the Minister of Economic Affairs of Italy visited Iran. After some encouraging talks and meetings, we built an excellent relationship to the extent that we signed a MoU in the private sector, in addition to their agreements with the Central Bank of Iran. We have already started our relationship through various transactions and levels of credit between Saman Bank and several Italian companies. This agreement shows the close relationship between both countries. After Italy, we are planning to open offices in Germany and the UK. Beside European borders, we are planning to expand to India and Turkey. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role do banks play in attracting foreign investment into national projects?</h4><p>This year we celebrate the 60th anniversary of Bank of Industry and Mine. In 1956 we were the first development bank in Iran, and although we have experienced many challenges during these years, we have always stuck to the vision of progress and development of the country. In this regard, we are not a commercial bank; we mainly participate in the financing of different projects. We have the human capital, the knowledge, and the experience to conduct projects in all types of industries, except agriculture and housing. We are experts in a wide range of sectors, including pharmaceuticals, textiles, food processing, the auto industry, home appliances, mining, steel mills, cement, and tile manufacturing. Moreover, Iran is renowned for its oil and gas resources. We are among the top-three countries in the world reserve-wise, production-wise, and, hopefully, after sanctions, export-wise. We want to focus on the areas where Iran has a competitive advantage, and the energy sector is definitely one of the areas we can depend on. Our portfolio is strong in financing projects in the petrochemicals field.</p><h4>What are the most important projects you have financed?</h4><p>In the past two-and-a-half years, we have focused on infrastructure with the expansion of the rail network. The first high-speed train developed between Tehran and Isfahan was financed by the Bank of Industry and Mine. We have also been awarded with a contract to finance another high-speed train between Tehran and Mashhad. We are involved in power generation as well, being the first bank to finance power plants in Iran. This is a great market for foreign investors, as we need to develop 3,000 MW in power generation annually. Moreover, we have financed desalination plants in the Persian Gulf. Such a megaproject could be replicated in the coming years, and we welcome other banks joining us to form a syndication for financing. Ports like Jask or Chabahar would be export terminals for the globe and neighboring countries. We want to be considered the developers of the country, which is why the market share in the industry and mining sector is over 16%.</p><h4>What is the position of the bank to resume relations with European banks?</h4><p>After sanctions, the door has been opened but not as fast as we expected. The bank was prepared to meet the international standards of the world's banking system even before sanctions, which makes me believe we are pioneers in this sense. It is a must for any bank in Iran to meet Basel III standards, and this means achieving a capital adequacy ratio over 12%. On the same day of the implementation of the JCPOA in January 2016, we were the first bank to be reconnected to the SWIFT network. We have resumed correspondent banking relations with 38 different banks from 18 countries, and another 22 banks are in the pipeline. Among European banks, Italy took the lead, and Germany will surpass it in the next two months. We are doing normal business with France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Spain. We are a major shareholder of the European-Iranian Bank (EiH), a strong bank based in Hamburg, which since the first day started to reestablish relations with Iranian banks. This is a great tool to facilitate relations with European firms. After being forced out of the market, we are back to contribute to the business of Iran and the region, as there are many opportunities in neighboring countries to cooperate with European companies. We can play a great role in connecting those firms to these countries, and Iran could be a platform for doing business and boosting the prosperity of the region and the world. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Bank On It]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[bank-on-it]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the idea behind creating a private bank in 2005?</h4><p>Pasargad is the most honored and respected name in Iran, as it means the center of Iranians. Every single word in the bank has a special meaning and has been carefully selected. Before establishing Bank Pasargad in 2005, it took more than eight years to study how to set up a bank that could be different from other banks and respected by the people. When I was the Governor of the Central Bank of Iran between 1986 and 1989, we had nine state-owned banks, and many entrepreneurs and investors in Iran were interested in establishing a private bank. The experience at the Central Bank helped me see all the strengths and weaknesses of the banking system. Being the CEO of Bank Melli was also a beneficial experience because state-owned banks work differently from private banks. Unlike many other banks, Bank Pasargad's distinctive culture considers and treats all our employees as bankers.</p><h4>Into which countries are you looking to expand?</h4><p>At this stage, the corresponding relationship with foreign banks is of primary importance to us. However, premier European banks are still hesitant to resume relations, as they seek more clarifications and assurances by the US Treasury's Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC). A few large European banks have visited us but have yet to establish full correspondent banking relations with our bank. Generally speaking, due to our past success and market share in Iran, all foreign delegations visiting Iran come to meet Bank Pasargad. In parallel, we are keen to establish a presence in the countries that have a high level of trade volume with Iran, such as China, India, Turkey, and a number of European countries. As a base principal, Bank Pasargad will develop its global expansion plan concurrent with Iran's international level of trade and in the countries with which it trades. This expansion plan will be either through representative offices, branches, JV banks with foreign local banks, or acquisitions. The choice will depend on the laws and regulations of each country. For instance, right now most countries prefer us to establish subsidiaries in order to give more supervisory power to the local regulatory authority. However, the natural and organic way for banks to grow internationally is through establishing a network composed of branches.</p><h4>What is the role of private banks in promoting trade with Iran?</h4><p>Private banks have been successful in the country and have steadily gained market share from state-owned banks. Because of our superior level of service, corporate culture, dynamic decision making process, and diversified financial products, people prefer to bank with Iran's private banks. Today, private banks hold a 60% share of all deposits. Iranian private banks have traditionally handled a significant portion of the country's trade volume, mainly because of their well-trained staff and the high quality of their documentary credits, and this has been recognized by all international banks. In this post-sanctions era, Iranian private banks will gain even more market share from state-owned banks because we will be able to truly compete and display our skills and expertise. I also foresee a market consolidation in the Iranian banking sector with considerable mergers and acquisition activity. There is an excellent opportunity for all foreign investors at this point to purchase shares in Iran's leading private banks. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What initiatives have been taken to drive Iranian banks to move toward Basel III requirements?</h4><p>Since 2015, the Central Bank of Iran has put on its agenda the process of updating banking regulations such as capital adequacy requirements and liquidity risk management in compliance with international supervision standards, the most important of which is the Basel III Accord. Accordingly, drafting procedures on supervision capital and the capital adequacy of credit institutions codified by the provisions of the Basel III capital agreement, other countries' experience, and considering Islamic banking specifications will be put on the agenda of the relevant authorities soon to fulfill the legal procedures to be approved. Obviously, after approval and notification of the stated procedure, it shall be implemented throughout the banking network. However, to support and update the liquidity management risk of banks and non-banking credit institutes and, considering this subject especially after the emergence of the global financial crisis and the related results and experiences, a draft procedure and minimum liquidity management risk of credit institutes has been prepared by using provisions of Basel III to be implemented after being legally approved at the state bank network.</p><h4>Which fiscal policies have been implemented to control inflation?</h4><p>As soon as the eleventh administration took power, the Iranian economy faced a worrying situation in terms of high inflation, volatility in the forex market, economists' lack of confidence, a remarkable decrease in investment, and negative economic growth. Within this context, the Central Bank of Iran focused on stabilizing the economy by concentrating on controlling inflation. In this regard, the Central Bank managed to control the inflation rate by supporting monetary discipline and stabilizing the forex market. The Central Bank put financing the Maskan Mehr Plan for the growth of monetary and liquidity base on its agenda. According to the approval of the Monetary and Credit Council on February 2014, it was resolved that the credit required for completion of incomplete Maskan Mehr projects shall be financed out by the collected installments of the previously granted facilities. Moreover, we took effective steps to control bank liabilities to the Central Bank and support the monetary market discipline by designing and establishing “Chakavak" (Iranian cheque imaging system) and restricting bank overdraft backgrounds via Bank Clearing House.</p><h4>What is your economic outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>After the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), new opportunities have emerged to increase financing and investment for the economy of Iran following oil production, improve access to foreign assets, reduce exchange expenses, and improve commercial relationships with other countries. One of the key factors in increasing economic growth in the current year is to increase the production and export of oil. As a result of the JCPOA and adopted measures, crude oil production volume in the country increased up to 1 million bpd. The initial predictions indicate that economic growth in 2016 will exceed 4%. Moreover, the implementation of the banking system reform plan, which was notified to the bank network this year, may provide the proper arrangement for reforms in the financial market and overcoming credit barriers in the banking network. If the plan is successful, it will solve credit barriers in banks, improve foreign financing, attract FDI, and may provide proper perspective for a meaningful increase in economic growth in the coming years. On the other hand, following policies and actions taken by the Central Bank concerning monetary discipline and stabilization of the foreign exchange market, we have observed inflation control up to 8.9% in August 2016. The Central Bank policy is to protect single-digit inflation, and the bank tries to stabilize inflation under 10%. Some risks resulted from reforming programs, such as the forex market reforms program, which may threaten inflation goals, but the equalization program has been designed in such a way that it has a minimum effect on price levels, and it is expected that the effects of the policy implementation will be properly managed. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does the lifting of sanctions represent a turning point for Atiyeh Saba's mission of giving local companies access to global markets?</h4><p>The lifting of sanctions means Iran will open up to the world after 20 years. Iranians are well known for their hospitality, but the removal of sanctions will grant the country the opportunity to show it to the world. When I took office, the sanctions were in the last process of removal. Since then, we organized a conference in Isfahan where we invited top officials involved in the hospitality sector, such as Kempinski, Rotana, Ritz Carlton, and the École hí´telií¨re de Lausanne. We wanted to show that we are ready to deal with the world, and we received a great response; so far, we have defined USD10 billion in projects with foreign investors. In order to be ready for the arrival of more visitors to Iran, we need to renovate the hospitality sector, as most of the hotels were built 45 years ago. This has become a major project for Atiyeh Saba, as we plan to build at least 50 five-star hotels.</p><h4>What investments are you conducting to prepare the required transport infrastructure for the development of tourism?</h4><p>Iran has about 250 aircraft in total, and Aseman Airlines is one of the leading airline in the country with strong roots even before the revolution. During the war and sanctions period, many of our aircraft were damaged, and we are currently renovating them. During the president's visit to France, we signed a MoU with Airbus, and 50 aircraft were assigned to Aseman. At the same time, we have to expand our airports and railroads. We started investing in a high-speed railroad from Tehran to Isfahan and have signed an MoU with Italy's ENZO Group to develop the Tehran-Mashhad railroad project, valued at USD5.5 million. Overall, we have signed USD8 billion in contracts with ENZO. Moreover, because of the pollution in Iran, we have signed a contract to purchase 14,000 hybrid cars to transport visitors throughout the country. We will send instructors to mosques and the five international airports to train drivers to improve their English. Besides our investments in transport, we are defining different attractions for the tourism industry. </p><h4>How are you attracting new technologies to the mining industry to develop the sector?</h4><p>Mining was not part of our activities before, but since I joined Atiyeh Saba we have set up a holding for the mining sector. We now hold multiple meetings with foreign companies that are interested in supporting projects financially. Mining projects take a long time in production, so it is not easy to find investors who want to wait five to seven years to make a profit. We aim to invest in different materials such as copper or in areas like Chadormalu.</p><h4>What are your plans for the year ahead?</h4><p>We want to show the world who we are and what we can do. We aim to share our projects with the world, and the best location to focus on first is the UAE. We organized an exhibition in Dubai to introduce ourselves to the world's biggest companies and show off our capabilities. Furthermore, we are developing the Melli National Shoe, a brand that has 240 stores throughout the world. We signed a contract with the Polytechnic University of Turin to redesign the shoe. The demands of young people have changed, so we have to make them believe this is what they need. We bring in the best expertise to all these projects. The country now needs to focus on creative ideas that create assets, not just invest. Thinking will bring about many assets for the development of Iran. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the role of IFIC in establishing confidence within the global market in order to attract foreign investment?</h4><p>As the main body for investing abroad on behalf of the government, IFIC has a big responsibility to strengthen the international economic relations of Iran. IFIC is now present on five continents, and we have investments in 22 countries. The first way we attract foreign investors to Iran is through foreign investments, as per our mandate and primary responsibility. When we carry out these investments abroad, we become part of the international network, creating an atmosphere of trust and indirectly inviting interested parties to come to Iran. We also have investments in private equities and stock markets around the world. We own shares in important companies such as British Petroleum, ThyssenKrupp, Siemens, Adidas, and many other big brands. Although IFIC is not allowed to invest in Iran on its own, we can also attract foreign investments by co-investing with foreign investors inside Iran through our subsidiaries. Our presence in any domestic project is a source of comfort for foreign investors to freely come to Iran.</p><h4>Does the lifting of sanctions represent a turning point in your investment strategy abroad?</h4><p>Our board reviewed our investment strategy—taking into consideration the post-sanction circumstances—and formulated a new plan that identified three target areas for investment, the first of which is financial institutions. Our investments will now focus more on the banking system, leasing companies, insurance and re-insurance firms, investment funds, and the like. Our second area for investment is global capital markets, as certain resources need high liquidity in order to be able to cash them for further FDIs. The third area is direct investment in high-tech industries, so we will concentrate on ICT and new sciences. In our portfolio, we have a large investment in ICT and mobile operations around the world. We are present in mobile operations in seven African countries and certain Asian countries. We have action plans in place to target these three investment areas in the coming years.</p><h4>What is the importance of maintaining a good relationship with the European market?</h4><p>One of IFIC's significant roles is to create a bridge between Iran and other countries with our investments, in order to pave the ground for knowledge and know-how transfer. This is one of the considerations we had in mind when we chose high-technology industries as a focus for our future investments. We feel more secure investing in European and other developed countries compared to less regulated countries. Despite the sanctions, IFIC's investments in Europe were almost intact. Our investments, capital gain, and dividends were all secure. After the lifting of sanctions we can transfer that money to new investment projects, and we are attracted to countries with good governance.</p><h4>What will be your position among leading global investment companies in the coming years?</h4><p>We have thus far made our investments by using the dividends and profits from our previous investments. However, currently we are in the process of creating an investment fund in Switzerland. This should give other investors enough confidence to also invest in this fund. At the same time, the fund prospectus clearly states it works with Iranian companies and finances them for trade. Trade financing is an important tool that Iranian companies are definitely in need of, which was the reason for creating this fund. It will help Iranian companies overcome the scarcity of resources they face at the moment. This fund should guarantee 6% profit annually at a time when interest rates in Europe are negative. With the lifting of sanctions, we have gained more freedom to operate more broadly and form partnerships with competent partners, which will hopefully lead to even better results in the future. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>According to your 10-year plan, what role should the private sector play in the development of the Iranian economy?</h4><p>After the signing of the JCPOA, all the countries showed their interest in reconnecting with Iran. At the same time, we were interested in connecting with the international economy. We learnt a great deal during the sanctions period, and low oil prices also convinced us of the necessity of changing our patterns toward a stronger private sector. In the foreseeable future, our economy will enter a new phase where all the development will be led by the private sector. The next 10 years will be very different from the previous 10, and we have many plans for venture capital projects across many sectors, such as agriculture and tourism.</p><h4>What is the importance of attracting foreign investment to achieve 5% GDP growth?</h4><p>Last year we had 5% growth only in the agriculture sector without any foreign investment. We also saw 4% growth in the oil and gas sector. But if we consider the unemployment rate in Iran, accounting for two and a half million to three million people, we have to reach more than 8% GDP growth this year to create enough jobs. In order to achieve this milestone, we have to absorb investment from abroad. Approximately 200 delegations have come to this chamber during the last few years. After visiting President of the European Parliament Martin Schulz in Brussels, he raised three points that are important to attract this investment, especially from Europe. First, he said Iran is not a consuming country and foreign companies have to invest in Iran by transferring technology making joint ventures. Secondly, Iran is not only a country with 80 million people; it is within a region of 400 million people and has great influence in those markets. Finally, he said all the agreements and MoUs that were signed earlier should be renewed and restarted in order to improve relations with Iran.</p><h4>How does the chamber cooperate with the government and parliament to promote trade?</h4><p>We have strong links with the public sector, the judiciary, and also parliament. We have to create procedures and transmit all the needs and difficulties of the private sector to the parliament and the government. We are a side of the government. Some members of the parliament come to the chamber and we discuss the private sector and the needs of the Iranian economy.</p><h4>What role can Iran play in the international market? </h4><p>When you look globally and focus on resources, population, history, and culture, Iran is a leader among all the countries in all sectors. Iran has had a deep influence on the history of humanity. Considering the power of our economy and our human resources, we have a leading position in the region as a transit hub from the north, south, east, and west corridors, with access to several neighboring countries. You will see the increasing influence of Iran in the near future, especially in energy and renewables. In tourism, mining, and minerals, we will also be a leader. We will be one of the safest countries in the near future and a source of production and distribution for international companies in the Middle East. Considering the geographical situation and access to oceans and seaports, Iran will be a hub for transporting goods to overseas markets. All this potential will be materialized if we develop our private sector. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess your visit to Iran and meeting with President Hassan Rouhani in April 2016?</h4><p>The purpose and strategic objective of the visit I undertook from April 23-25 to the Islamic Republic of Iran was aimed at elevating bilateral political, economic, and person-to-person relations between the two countries into a substantive strategic partnership that will benefit both countries and their peoples. To this end, my visit reaffirmed the South African government's unwavering support for the people and government of Iran as they enter the post-sanctions period. We agreed with President Rouhani that we need to translate the strong relations that exist between our countries into tangible projects, particularly in trade, investment, and economic sectors. Indeed, during that visit, we signed eight MoUs ranging from energy to investment to insurance that will serve as a catalyst to fast track economic and trade relations. We also agreed to set up a special high-level mechanism to realize this goal.</p><h4>Both sides have expressed their willingness to boost bilateral ties. What are the possible main areas of cooperation between South Africa and Iran?</h4><p>There are vast areas wherein we could potentially cooperate, but for the immediate future we have agreed to work together to create an institutional framework that will allow for the free movement of goods and services between our countries, particularly in financial services, mining, energy, and tourism. A number of business projects in various sectors are also in the pipeline. Since my visit, a number of departments, including trade and industry as well as the private sector, from both South Africa and Iran have begun negotiations in hopes of laying a solid foundation for trade. Some of those negotiations have reached their final stages, and companies from both sides are ready to conclude deals. All these are part of a long-term strategic plan to strengthen bilateral economic relations. We have also emphasized the need to cooperate at the multilateral level, especially on issues of mutual interest. South Africa and Iran share the view that there is a need to transform global institutions, to make them more equitable, just, people centered, and development oriented. Following the nuclear agreement, we expect Iran to play a leading role in the region, especially in contributing positively to finding lasting solutions to regional challenges. </p><h4>How will this new relationship between South Africa and Iran boost economic growth in both countries? </h4><p>The relationship between South Africa and Iran is not new. Iran was South Africa's top trading partner in the region before the imposition of unilateral sanctions. As countries that are almost at the same developmental stage, the economic relations that we seek to re-establish with Iran are based on equitable trade. Those relations will be based on state-to-state cooperation, business-to-business engagements, and people-to-people relations. During my visit, we identified a number of sectors where there are huge opportunities, including oil, gas, petrochemical products, mining services and technology, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, and heavy industry, as well the export of agricultural products such as citrus fruit and red meat to Iran by South Africa.</p><h4>What is the importance of Iran as a trade partner for African countries?</h4><p>Iran is a highly diversified and sophisticated energy giant with a great record in broad-based development. We are pleased that Iran is working on an Africa strategy to increase its profile and involvement on the continent and we look forward to a strong Africa-Iran development partnership emerging in the near future. Of course, we agree with Iranians that South Africa is the ideal strategic entry point for Iran to access the African market. South Africa is also of the view that Iran is an avenue for South Africa's export products into the Middle East. This is especially important given South Africa's economic diversification strategy, as we confront the challenges posed by the international economic climate. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your assessment on the historic relationship between Switzerland and Iran?</h4><p>Switzerland has longstanding, friendly relations with Iran based on dialog on all matters of common concern and mutual respect. The existing friendship treaty between our countries dates back to more than 140 years and is a telling sign of the quality of our ties. Even during difficult times, Switzerland was always present in Iran. Our policy of dialog, the culture of listening, respect, and searching for common ground has created a relation of continuity and trust between our countries. Switzerland's protecting power mandate for the US in Iran, which we have fulfilled since 1980, is equally based on this culture. In this same spirit, Switzerland has always supported a diplomatic solution regarding Iran's nuclear program, both in substance and by hosting negotiations. We are proud that the adoption of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) took place in Geneva and the general framework of the current agreement was concluded on April 2, 2015 in Lausanne. On a personal level, I had the honor and pleasure to experience and reaffirm this bond several times myself in meetings with representatives of the Islamic Republic of Iran. In February 2016, I was the first-ever Swiss President to visit Tehran, where I was welcomed with the famous Iranian hospitality and warmth by my counterpart, President Hassan Rouhani, as well as by the Supreme Leader, Seyyed Ali Khamenei.</p><h4>Both countries have expressed willingness to boost cooperation. What are the potential areas of cooperation between Switzerland and Iran in this new era for the country?</h4><p>Together with President Rouhani, we adopted a comprehensive road map covering 12 areas of cooperation. One important part of it deals with political consultations, including on regional security. We have also resumed our dialog on human rights issues and started consultations on legal and judicial matters, with a first round in Switzerland. Other areas include tourism, transportation, agriculture, and completing economic and financial dialog. In the field of science, research, and technology, I see high potential, as both of our countries have highly qualified people and host some renowned scientific institutions. Fostering direct cooperation between universities and scientific institutions proves to be a promising way forward. The activities since the conclusion of this cooperation program on February 27, 2016 have been impressive; we have welcomed several high-level delegations from different ministries and institutions in Switzerland, and many Swiss businesspeople and government representatives have visited Iran since then.</p><h4>Seven months after the signing of the JCPOA, big European banks remain reluctant to handle Iranian payments. How can Switzerland help Iran return to the international banking system?</h4><p>Switzerland welcomes the reintegration of Iran into the global financial system after the implementation of the JCPOA. As part of the roadmap to strengthen bilateral relations, it has thus established a financial dialog with Iran. Within the scope of this dialog, Switzerland supports Iran in its efforts to implement international standards, such as in the area of anti-money laundering and banking regulation, and engages on challenges remaining for payments, transactions, and trade financing in Iran.</p><h4>What is your opinion on the stabilizing role Iran can play in the Middle East and its bilateral relations with neighboring countries?</h4><p>Iran is a key player in the region. A rapprochement between Tehran and Riyadh would obviously help stabilize the region. In view of the good relations that Switzerland maintains with both countries, we are committed to supporting this process. Iran has already demonstrated its positive influence in the region by promoting the need for a trilateral humanitarian dialog format with Syria and Switzerland. So far, several rounds have been held with the objective of improving humanitarian assistance for all Syrians in need. This dialog is complementary to and reinforces ongoing dialogs by other humanitarian actors on the ground. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Fifteen years have passed since the painful terrorist attack in New York, a disaster whose human dimensions moved the entire world. On that day, no one imagined that this occurrence would lead to larger disasters, resulting in a devastating war in the Middle East and the spread of insecurity across the globe. This war has sown the seeds of borderless terrorism everywhere on earth. Today, the most pressing question as to why we are facing such a situation should be on the agenda of international forums. We need to find out which approaches, policies, and erroneous actions paved the way for the spread of insecurity throughout the world. And what would be the picture the world 15 years from now.</p><p>Security has become a global problem at a time when major powers are mainly focusing on advancing different methods of repression and military intervention under the pretext of creating a secure environment for their citizens. The genesis of borderless violent extremism and terrorism could be attributed to the security strategies developed by major powers in the past 15 years. The main lesson to learn from the analysis of this trend is that security in one region at the cost of insecurity in others would not only be impossible but it could also lead to more insecurity everywhere.</p><p>The terrorists even went as far as claiming to have established States in the Levant, Iraq, and Libya. More unfortunately, they hide their nefarious intents behind religious literature, thus turning a compassionate religion into an instrument of violence and terror by spreading extremist and Takfiri propaganda.<br>The century that began with terror and violence in New York should not continue with hostile competitions and expanding conflicts in the Middle East.</p><p>Today in fact, the discourse of hatred and violence in the Middle East and North Africa is spreading with an astonishing speed, and this region is stuck in a web of the most savage and destructive policies. Millions of Syrians are stranded in deserts and high seas, and hundreds of thousands of them are subjected to violent deaths. Iraqis of every ethnic group are concerned about their territorial integrity and the future of their homeland. The defenseless people of Yemen are subjected to daily aerial bombardment, and Afghanistan, following decades of occupation and atrocity, is yet to find comfort from suffering, violence, and terror. The oppressed Palestinians are still afflicted by a web of apartheid policies and atrocities set by the usurping Zionist regime.</p><p>Undoubtedly, if the region is to reverse the current dangerous trend into one towards development and stability, certain countries must stop bombing their neighbors, and abandon supporting Takfiri terrorist groups, and, while accepting responsibility, try to compensate for past mistakes. If the Saudi government is serious about its vision for development and regional security, it must cease and desist from divisive policies, spread of hate ideology and trampling upon the rights of neighbours, accept its responsibility for the protection of the lives and dignity of pilgrims, and construct its relations with the nations in the region on the basis of mutual respect and accountability.</p><p>The future of our region rests on dealing with fundamental challenges such as security crises, due to the inefficiency and the lack of legitimacy of governments. We will not be able to combat criminal and terrorist networks without genuine democracy and without a real participatory approach at the national and transnational levels.</p><p>Iran's principled approach calls for constructive partnership with our neighbors with a view to establishing an enduring order based on shared security and efforts aimed at enhancing the development of the countries in the region and mutually beneficial economic cooperation. To uproot violence in the region, there is no choice but to focus on promoting democracy, citizenship rights, and economic development.</p><p>Iran opposes any kind of sectarianism and any attempt to promote religious gaps. The Muslim people, be they Shias or Sunnis, have lived together for centuries in harmony and mutual respect, and will continue to do so. Attempts to turn religious dissimilarities into tense confrontations are rooted in vested interests of certain countries, which try to hide their quest for power covered in religious slogans. Iran considers it imperative to preserve the territorial integrity of states, keep national borders intact, enhance peoples' right to self-determination, and uphold the principle of refraining from the threat or use of force. We also reiterate the need to use diplomacy for conflict resolution.</p><p>Despite today's difficulties, I have hope in tomorrow. I have no doubt that we can prevail through prudence and wisdom. The experience acquired through dialogue between Iran and the group of 5+1 and the fruition of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) are indicative of the success that we could achieve through moderation, constructive interaction and the promotion of dialogue; a policy that brought a long, complicated, and unnecessary crisis to an end by adopting a win-win approach. This deal confirmed the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear program through devising confidence-building mechanisms, closing the so-called "possible military dimension" file and reinstating Iran's right to develop a peaceful nuclear program. This deal also put an end to unfounded concerns and led to the removal of the brutal sanctions against Iran.</p><p>Beyond the nuclear file, however, the JCPOA contains important lessons for resolving complicated international problems.  This deal is not only a political agreement; it also represents a creative approach and method for constructive interaction with a view to peacefully resolving crises and challenges. To learn lessons from the JCPOA and put them towards improving international relations, we should never forget that pressures, sanctions and illegal threats, which sought to fully dismantle Iran's enrichment program, were all defeated. And today, the UN Security Council and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have formally accepted Iran's peaceful nuclear program.</p><p>The US is fully aware that JCPOA constitutes a recognized multilateral agreement, and any failure on the part of the US in implementing it would constitute an international wrongful act and would be objected to by the international community. Any failure in implementing the JCPOA will further erode the credibility of the US in the world. The lack of compliance with the JCPOA on the part of the US in the past several months represents a flawed approach that should be rectified forthwith. Unfortunately, such illegal actions are not unprecedented: the latest case in point is the US Supreme Court ruling to seize billions of dollars of the Iranian people's assets. This experience demonstrated that the Zionist pressure groups could go as far as having US Congress pass indefensible legislations forcing the highest American judicial institution to violate pre-emptory norms of international law.</p><p>With God's help, the Iranian people's endurance and the increasing participation of Iran's international partners from different regions, only eight months after the removal of the cruel nuclear-related sanctions, the economy of Iran, as the most secure and most profitable investment destination in the region, is showing clear improvement. Iran's economic growth rate surpassed 4% in spring 2016, the inflation rate dropped to single digits, and Iran has come close to pre-sanction level of oil production and export. All in all, we are witnessing more development in the economic, scientific and technological fields in Iran.</p><p>Iran is one of the rare oil-producing countries that could offset the shocking impact of the sharp slide in oil price in 2014. We are intent on strengthening economic stability and consistency, thus encouraging more investment, through economic reforms and fiscal and financial discipline, while preserving our low-inflation achievement. The economic growth is to increase to around 5% by the end of 2016. Currently, based on all domestic and international prediction, Iran is enjoying one the highest growth rates among the oil-producing countries.</p><p>Despite all hardships, I deeply believe that moderation will prevail over extremism, peace will triumph over violence, enlightenment will overcome ignorance, and finally justice will rise above injustice. What is important is that belief, hope and efforts are towards realizing peace and justice and there is no doubt that the Almighty will assist all those who endeavor towards peace, justice and moderation. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the key successes of TCEB in boosting Thailand's MICE industry?<br></h4><p>We have been fortunate over the last three to four years to receive a large number of attendees for high-profile events here in Thailand, often attracting 50,000 visitors and above. One of the reasons for this is because we actively target corporate clients such as business leaders, executives, and board members from key multinational companies to persuade them to hold their meetings in Bangkok. It is not only about offering them first-class facilities; they also want to be on the ground and perhaps see how big the market is and what the potential for growth is. In particular, we target markets in southern China in line with the surge in visitors from there. From global economic forecasts, money markets grow quickly in this region and business naturally follows the money. We will also hold a number of large international conferences in Bangkok for niche sectors. In terms of exhibitions, as Thailand has great manufacturing capabilities, we are able to organize some of the largest and most respected exhibitions here. In the past few months alone, we have organized some major high-profile events for the packaging, gems, IT, and telecoms industries. At the same time, Thailand is renowned for its automotive and tourism-related exhibitions and these are held regularly here to the highest global standards, bringing in tens of thousands of international visitors.<br></p><h4>What is the importance of community-based tourism, and why is it such a priority for the government?<br></h4><p>We are situated in the middle of three of the biggest and oldest civilizations in the world: India, China, and the Khmer. These three civilizations, each over 1,000 years old, mixing together here has made our land one big melting pot over the past millennium, and gives us a unique culture and heritage to not only show the world but also to appreciate ourselves. Community-based tourism allows us to explore more about ourselves. For foreigners interested in exploring this rich heritage, the typical tourist packages fail to give them this experience. Packages are often fully prearranged, including accommodation, food, and other vendors, and there is little opportunity to actually explore. Community-based tourism takes a different approach; it allows visitors to really zoom in and experience the grassroots of the culture, mixing with locals, learning from each other, and sharing experiences. This is important for the country because it allows us to diversify our tourism mix; we can channel the record number of arrivals expected this year to different regions and experiences. More importantly, for the communities mentioned, it gives them a sustainable source of revenue and opens a whole new world of opportunities. This is where DASTA comes in.<br></p><h4>What have been the key achievements of DASTA in supporting community-based tourism in Thailand?<br></h4><p>Over the past decade, we have helped develop six regions across the country as community-based tourism destinations: Koh Chang, Pattaya, Sukhothai, Loei, Nan, and Suphan Buri. The goal of DASTA is not to change the community, it is to support regions if they wish to benefit from the boom in Thailand's tourism industry. After an area is designated directly by the cabinet, we create a master plan with the local community, a process that can often take many years to get right and make everyone happy. The relationship between the central government and local authorities is not always smooth at the beginning. Over time, we bring everyone together, including the local authorities, members of the community, and business people, and discuss ways to create opportunities for everyone. I can confidently say that in each of the areas we have developed, we are always welcomed in the end. Now we seek cabinet approval to also develop Chiang Saen in Chiang Rai province, and Cha-am and Hua Hin in Phetchaburi and Prachuap Khiri Khan provinces, respectively. Going forward, I see great opportunity for DASTA to expand its capability and serve each area of the country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>BCR has registered the highest growth among all financial institutions in Costa Rica, growing from CRC9.575 million in 2015 to CRC25.031 million in 2016, an increase of 161%. What strategy is the bank following to maintain this growth rate?<br></h4><p>One of the important strategic focuses of the bank and an issue that we have commented on publicly is that of improving efficiency. The bank is focused on the topic of expenditure containment, and we want to use this model to deal with the fiscal deficit in the country. Expenditure containment is a policy that BCR has implemented from the outset. The BCR has achieved a net quarterly profit higher than CRC12,000 million for the third consecutive quarter, reaching a cumulative net at the end of 1H2016 of CRC25.031 million, 161% more than a year ago. In turn, income before income taxes and mandatory contributions amounted to CRC40,863 million, 204% more than in 1H2015. An audit for all expenses for advertising, salary, fixed costs, overheads, and the business review also looked at whether the offices were profitable or not, and at the possibility of renewing brands. After the analysis, the high administration of the bank made a proposal calling for important reductions in the first and second years. Regarding administrative expenses, actions and decisions taken in 4Q2015, including voluntary labor mobility and the elimination of two layers of management, have led to a 9% reduction in staff costs in 1H2016, saving more than CRC4,400 million in expenses during that period. The change in the business model of BCR to one in which we promote the philosophy of maximum regional autonomy with maximum responsibility, measuring the results through the relative profit contribution of each office and region, has converted the bank into a mainly retail bank. We are focused on individuals and small businesses, and have implemented our new model successfully across the country in the first half of this year.<br></p><h4>BCR has a wide portfolio of services for individual and corporate clients. In which areas is the bank currently focusing most?<br></h4><p>Historically, it has been a corporate bank. Nevertheless, with the new administration and with the new General Manager, Mario Barrenechea, we are mainly focusing on the retail business which is leading to the development of different brands. There are also surprise brands that can more effectively promote the growth of retail banking. We are strengthening the whole managerial and corporate system that BCR has traditionally had with particularly robust companies, and we have improved the overall service level. We are making progress and growing. This year we did an interesting project regarding financial inclusiveness. BCR completed a pioneering launch with Kristal Banking, which offers financial services exclusively for women. This was key and a top priority plan for myself as a woman as well as for my female companions on the Board of Directors. There was polemic around it, as is the case with any pioneering topic, but ultimately it was an interesting process that enriched us. We continue to move forward with the brand, and it is continuously growing and becoming more inclusive. Nearly 50% of women in Costa Rica had never used banking services at the time we started the brand.<br></p><h4>Banking revenues increased by 48% in the first half of 2016. How do you foresee the second half of the year closing, and where do you see BCR within this outlook?<br></h4><p>We are continuing to grow as bank. It is necessary for the growth and the permanence of the public banking that exists to make possible some legislative changes that allow us to strengthen and compete on a wider scale. The major challenge in the next five years will be maintaining our growth levels. To remain on the same trajectory BCR has followed for 139 years we need political support and legislative changes that will eventually allow us to compete equally with the private banking sector without restriction. Public banking offers a few services that the private banking does not offer for the more vulnerable sectors of the country.<br></p><h4>In general what advantages and benefits does Costa Rica offer for investment, and how is BCR working to attract FDI?<br></h4><p>As a bank we offer services. The whole issue of external trade in the country has been doing good work in attracting foreign investment. The Ministry of Exterior Trade (CINDE) and PROCOMER have been doing an excellent job. Independent of the minister in charge, they have a consistent agenda and we get feedback from government institutions thanks to our good relations with them. We have been working together to attract investments to our bank, and obviously corporate banking is important to us. This specific situation requires a strengthening of retail banking to lower the cumulative risk of credit portfolios and to keep balance. We have concentrated credit in the corporate segment.<br></p><h4>What are some of your main priorities for 2017?<br></h4><p>We have five directions on which the Board of Directors has been working hard. We know that the BCR has to improve upon every day in the services that it offers, but digital banking topic is a great challenge and interesting topic for us. If we do not have the digital platform, then our future customer growth would be limited to only our existing important costumers. The millennials and many corporate banking customers are coming less often to the banks and use different modern services with efficient and highly competitive platforms. In that sense, this bank has an enormous challenge, and we have to focus on these tasks as a Board of Directors and get creative in re the limitations that today we have in agreement with the law, and advance without breaking the legal infringing on any laws. We are working at this, as it is part of our aim for growing next year. There exists a global consensus that Costa Rica will peacefully maintain economic stability in the coming years. Education has been fundamental to our country, and the current government is also determined to strengthen education plans from the schools up to the universities. The BCR has come from the hand in this way and give more support to public institutions than nearly any other bank. BCR has throughout its history been a pioneer in economic and social development throughout the entire country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-brand-new-look]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does Grupo Aval's rebranding relate to its future strategies?<br></h4><p>We are often seen as a solid and dependable financial group, but not necessarily as young or innovative. Thus, in the past four or five years, we decided to reach out to millennials—mostly through entertainment, but also through innovative products such as electronic wallets or smart-phone pay products. We were the first to offer a virtual wallet that accepts all the credit cards in the market, and also wristbands that give you access to and with which you can pay in concession stands during concerts, obviating the need to carry cash. We decided to rebrand our logo to one that conveys a lighter, younger, and more innovative image to complement these developments. We are also very interested in mobile banking because we firmly believe that this is the direction in which the financial world is moving. We want to be a part of that and to be the leaders in innovation in Colombia. So far, it seems to be working.<br></p><h4>How do you see the uncertainty of the peace negotiations affecting foreign investor negotiations and the economy overall?<br></h4><p>As was the case immediately after Brexit, we are seeing some uncertainty in the markets. If you saw what happened with the dollar-peso exchange rate and the stock exchange, sure there were some negative reactions, but to be honest with you, in the long term I am not particularly concerned. As opposed to Brexit, I am confident that people will soon realize that the end result of what happened in the referendum is that Colombia will end up negotiating a better deal supported by the vast majority of its population. And this deal will be better for investor confidence and for the country in the long run. If the referendum had passed by a similar margin—barely 60,000 votes—the government would have had real trouble in smoothly implementing the negotiated treaty because it would have been constantly reminded that only 50% of the voters supported the negotiation. I am also convinced that if we can get the political forces behind the Yes and No camps to act in unison, we will have a good chance of achieving much-needed structural fiscal reforms.<br></p><h4>What key issues are you looking to be dealt with in the fiscal reforms?</h4><p>After what was frankly a somewhat hostile tax reform in 2014, we are looking for a more business-friendly and integral fiscal reform this time around. It will need to reduce taxes on businesses and expand the tax-payer base. It might also end up taxing dividends—even though at the end of the day, a tax on dividends is also tax on corporations since dividends originate from corporate income. So we expect that once dividends are taxed, in addition to the new tax on corporations, the combined rate will be less than what it is today and obviously less than what the tax on corporations is slated to be in two years when it is scheduled to rise to around 48%. We also expect that the VAT will have to go up; there is no other way to increase fiscal revenues. One potential problem with convincing congress of the need to raise VAT is that the government has insisted that the reason behind the increase is to finance “post-conflict“ costs. Since the plebiscite was defeated it is going to be tough for the government to sell a new theory. However, the reality of it is that at the end of the day there is a deficit that needs to be plugged and that's just the iron rule of deficits. Also, the government needs additional fiscal revenues because it has promised that by 2018 or 2019, it will fall into compliance with the existing fiscal rule, and to do so they have to start contracting the deficit soon. Obviously, one of the reasons the deficit has grown is because of the demise of the oil industry which used to contribute with 20% of all fiscal revenues and has recently dwindled to almost nothing. I see no other way of fixing the deficit than by congress passing an integral fiscal reform that includes an increase in VAT. Reforms and particularly tax reforms are always tough, so the government needs to be very transparent. If we are to fix the country's finances, the government must make clear that we need everybody to contribute to the extent that they can. But if the entire burden is placed on the backs of businesses, as happened as a consequence of the 2014 fiscal reform, this will have a hugely negative impact on the business environment, not to mention scare away foreign businesses willing to invest in Colombia. However, this is a smart government, and I have to believe that the Minister of Finance is not going to make the same mistake again. The reality is that we need to make the government's two biggest initiatives independent of one another: fiscal reform, on one hand, and the peace process, on the other. Though we have mixed the two in the past, we cannot continue to do so. One thing is clear: oil is gone, and we have to take care of the of the country´s finances, peace deal or not.<br></p><h4>What are your goals or targets in 2017 for Grupo Aval?<br></h4><p>We are targeting consolidated growth of around 13%. We also expect better performances in Central America than Colombia because the economies there are different. In Colombia, we export oil and in Central America we import it, so low-cost oil is good for the latter. The other thing is that whenever the US economy rebounds this will have a major effect on Central America as the people there heavily rely on remittances from the US. In general acros all our markets we foresee better performances in the coming year than in 2016, with some growth and improved quality control of our assets and costs of risk. There are also additional opportunities in Colombia from the infrastructure sector with the 4G Infrastructure Plan, which has already become a reality. Our banks have already offered about USD2.5 billion in financing, which will start being disbursed next year. This is going to be a big contributor to Aval's growth because we participate as a group not only on the financing side of infrastructure but also on the equity side as constructors and concessionaires. The latter should give us good returns on our merchant bank, Corficolombiana. We will also keep implementing our strategy to get closer to a younger audience and to keep evolving in tune with how they want to do their banking. We are exploring various new sales channels to reach people through electronics and the internet. In a nutshell, we adapt our strategy to the times, relying just as heavily on the ethical, financial, marketing, and strategic premises that have brought us this far.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Long-term development can only be achieved through a modern and interconnected infrastructure network. What is the government's approach to tackling this issue?<br></h4><p>Infrastructure is an important asset for any country. There is no development or economic progress without the proper infrastructure to support it. In 2016, the government decided it wanted to build a network of state-of-the-art infrastructure for Tanzania to become a middle-income country by 2025. Our mission at the Ministry of Works, Transport and Communication (MoW) is to build this state-of-the-art infrastructure for town roads, ports, and aviation. To this end, in 2016 the government allocated TZS2.496 trillion to transport projects in the country. Some of this is going toward the building of a standard gauge railway from Dar es Salaam to Dodoma, Tabora, Isaka, and on to Mwanza, around 1,219km of track. We also want to connect from Isaka to Musoma so trains can go to Kigali in Rwanda, which involves another 361km of track. Further, we want to connect from Tabora going to Kigoma to transport goods on to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The railway network we are going to build will have a total of 2,506km of track. Phase one will be 1,219 km of track and phases two to four will follow over time.<br></p><h4>What other important infrastructure works are you prioritizing in 2016/2017?<br></h4><p>Other than the rail, we want to revive Air Tanzania because if you do not have proper air transport your economy will not grow fast enough. Some businesses and products require a quick transportation service. In 2016, the budget for reviving Air Tanzania is TZS700 billion. In 3Q2016, we are receiving two new aircraft, Bombardier Q400s, from Bombardier in Canada. The Bombardier Q400 carries around 76 passengers and these two new aircraft will be dedicated to Tanzania's internal market. In 3Q2016, we are also opening up a tender for two additional new aircraft. We want jet aircraft capable of carrying 130 passengers. Having brought new aircraft we need to concentrate on airport infrastructure first. This is the priority. Currently, we are building Dar es Salaam International Airport Terminal Three and are expanding the facilities in Mwanza. We have just finished building a new airport in Dodoma as the government is shifting there and we need to prepare the city to be our new capital. We are also building new airport terminal buildings in Kigoma and Tabora. This means we have a total of five airport projects happening under our 2016 budget. We are planning to build another three airports in Iringa, Sumbawanga, and Musoma, probably by May 2017. Every region of the country should then have a tarmac runway airport. We have allocated TZS200 billion to the construction of airports, TSZ100 billion of which was from development partners.<br></p><h4>What are the government's plans for new marine and port infrastructure projects?<br></h4><p>In terms of marine transport, this is important for northern Tanzania where we have Lake Victoria, Lake Tanganyika, and Lake Eyasi. We need to develop our marine sector. In 2016, we have put out a tender for a new ship to be built for use on Lake Victoria. We have invited overseas companies to tender for this work. The ship will be for 1,200 passengers plus 400 tons of cargo. We also want to repair all our existing vessels on both Lake Victoria and Lake Tanganyika. In terms of maritime port infrastructure, starting with the Port of Dar es Salaam, this is important to the economy of Tanzania and our neighboring countries. Rwanda, Burundi, Malawi, and Zambia all use the Port of Dar es Salaam because it is safe; it provides a service to five landlocked countries that depend on Tanzania's ports for sea access. We want to make Dar es Salaam Port a logistics hub for East African countries. Not only that, we also want to have proper connections and state of the art equipment to fulfill the requirements of a logistics hub for the region. For Tanzania, this port is the heart of our economy therefore in 2016 the government plans to spend USD250 million through the Port of Dar es Salaam for infrastructure works there. At the same time we are in negotiations with the World Bank for funding to further develop the port at Dar es Salaam. We expect to get a contribution of USD600 million from the World Bank. The first priority is to increase the depth of the port at Dar es Salaam and we also want to widen the port entrance. We want to do a lot of development work on berths one to seven and then develop a new berth 13 and 14 for container purposes. We have already put out a tender for developing a new berth number four at the Port of Mtwara, which is an important port for developing the southern part of Tanzania. Bagamoyo Port is an interesting asset. The government has been working closely with China and Oman to ensure that we modernize the port facility there.<br></p><h4>What is your strategy for supporting the development of telecoms infrastructure?<br></h4><p>Telecommunications is very important for any country. If you want to work effectively and efficiently you need a proper ICT system. The government of Tanzania has invested around USD200 million in building the national ICT backbone infrastructure. Every region and district of Tanzania has been connected to the national ICT backbone and Tanzania has 24,000km of fiber-optic cables, most of which was the result of PPPs, and 3G is accessible in many parts of the country. That technology can be used to alleviate the poverty problem in this country and is ultimately the only way we can minimize the gap between our urban and rural population. To this end we are investing in young entrepreneurs. For example, in 2014 we developed the Dar es Salaam incubator to foster entrepreneurship to ensure that these young innovators are part of the development of Tanzania.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[change-in-the-air]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does the JCPOA represent a turning point in Iran Air's operations?<br></h4><p>The sanctions on the Iranian aviation industry started 38 years ago, after the Islamic Revolution, but over the past seven years they were worse. During this time we could not purchase any aircraft nor refuel in European airports. When the JCPOA was signed, everybody was expecting that the civil aviation sanctions would be lifted and the US would permit the transfer of civil aircraft to Iran, Today, eight months after the implementation day, I cannot say this achievement has been done successfully. The JCPOA has partially relieved the pressure on the Iranian civil aviation industry, but there are still some remaining issues, such as difficulties in resuming banking payments. European and Asian airlines have restarted their flights to Iran, and we are making sure that they are provided with all the necessary facilities to operate in Iran. Unfortunately, there has not been the same response from other countries regarding Iran Air. Our history goes back 55 years, and we reached 14 destinations in Europe without receiving one drop of fuel abroad. In most countries the national carrier enjoys high prestige and represents the country internationally. Iran Air must not be an exception to this general axiom and should represent Iran in the international arena in its role as national carrier and in rendering world-quality services.<br></p><h4>What is the current status of the renovation of Iran Air's fleet after the agreements with Airbus and Boeing?<br></h4><p>The modernization of our fleet is an indispensable part of the airline's strategic plan to lower costs, to enhance safety and comfort, and to have a larger share in the competitive market. Accordingly, the agreements with Boeing and Airbus affirm our determination to the modernization of our fleet. The negotiations are still continuing, and the long-awaited export license for these two major aircraft manufacturers by US Organization of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) should be issued soon. The Airbus deal was signed eight months ago, though the purchase agreement is still ongoing. In addition, Iran Air was Boeing's first operator in the region, and now it has the willingness to be present in the Iranian market again. Moreover, we are negotiating with other manufacturers like ATR, Bombardier, and Embraer, but they are also awaiting the OFAC license.<br></p><h4>What position would Iran Air like to achieve in the international civil aviation industry? <br></h4><p>We have defined a 10-year plan. In the first three-year phase we expect to receive the aircraft we have ordered. We have missed one year already as we were supposed to receive seven or eight wide bodies in 2016, but we will receive only one or two. According to the schedule, the plan for 2017 is to receive 12-14 aircraft from Airbus. By substituting the old aircrafts with new ones, we will keep the present domestic and international network and increase frequency. As a result we will be able to compete with foreign airlines for European or Asian routes and in the future will define new destinations.<br></p><h4>How do you assess the potential of Iran to become a transit hub between Europe and Asia?<br></h4><p>One of the major issues in becoming a transit point is having the right infrastructure, and at present I do not think Iran is prepared to be a hub. There is a five-year plan to expand the five major airports of the country. The infrastructure needs first to be expanded for the transit of aircraft. At the moment, Iran can receive all types of aircraft with the exception of A380s. If we succeed in our infrastructure expansion plans, we have the possibility to be a point of transit between Europe and Asia, as Tehran is a natural to stopover point on that route. In contrast with countries in the Persian Gulf, stopping over in Iran would save at least two hours of flight time and this would reduce fuel and ticket costs. We must prepare the necessary equipment to bring passengers five or six hours from Europe and transfer them another seven or eight hours to the Far East. Overall, the optimization of operational routes can prove Iran to be a more cost-efficient hub to connect both continents. The potential is great but the infrastructure needs more development and efficiency to meet the demand.<br></p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead?<br></h4><p>I have been with Iran Air for 27 years, starting as an engineer in the technical department and passing from the commercial department as a representative in Germany, then moving up into management. I love this company and have been dealing with the sanctions during my entire career and carrying the responsibility of the safety of our staff and passengers. After many years working under such difficulties, I would be happy to see the logo of Iran Air on new aircraft. Iran Air has been a pioneer in the past, operating daily flights from Tehran to New York with Boeing 747SP. We have the experience and the potential to fly to Vancouver, Montreal, Singapore, and Sydney, with pilots that have over 32,000 flights and 40 years of experience and technicians of almost the same in this company. All of them deserve to see this change. Before leaving the company, I would like to be able to say that I have bought new aircraft for Iran Air. In this sense, I expect to see a more agile and responsive execution of the JCPOA commitments. Iran Air has learned from its experience of being a service-oriented company and we wish to be the first-choice for Iranians by virtue of our actions.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The company started operations in 1991. What opportunities in the market inspired you to start the business?<br></h4><p>The country has experienced periods of economic crisis, but as our business model is diversified across different segments it thrives during periods of crisis as individuals search for opportunities to generate additional income. There has traditionally been a limited entrepreneurial culture in Mexico and Latin America, and we believed this situation needed to change.<br></p><h4>What role has Omnilife played in developing entrepreneurship in Mexico?<br></h4><p>It has played an important role. Overall we have 7 million agents and 1.5 million distributors in Mexico alone. We focus our efforts on the base of the social pyramid, the lowest-income part of the population. We have training schools where we teach independent thinking in business, but also how to advance through study. Around 30% of the people who start working for Omnilife are illiterate, and 14% are indigenous individuals that do not speak Spanish. We improve their lives by teaching them basic reading and writing skills, and prepare them for other future studies they may pursue. Our main concern is the people. In fact, every distributor has my personal number and can contact me with any concerns they may have. This model has helped the organization to grow, as our distributors stay working with the company for the long term.<br></p><h4>What are the challenges for entrepreneurship in Mexico?<br></h4><p>The main challenge is to change the cultural paradigm. Mexican tradition does not teach individuals to visualize the future, despite the opportunities that are emerging for the country with each passing day. It is important for Mexican companies to start thinking in terms of long-term goals.<br></p><h4>Did you originally have a long-term plan when you established Omnilife?<br></h4><p>We definitely had a long-term plan, and we are now beginning to grow as I forecasted almost 25 years ago. We have managed to build and maintain a base for the company, and our goal is to reach 50 million agents. We first expanded our operations to Colombia where we were one of three Mexican companies present there. The mindset is usually to aim for markets in the US or Europe, but rarely to enter dynamic markets in South America. It is expensive to operate in European countries, and our businesses in Spain cost four times more to run in other locations in Latin America. The response is much slower and competition there is brutal.<br></p><h4>What is your strategy for Latin American markets in the coming years?<br></h4><p>Currently, the regulatory framework in Argentina is detrimental to our revenue margin, and we are restricted as companies are prohibited from channeling local earnings into import operations as profits cannot be taken from Argentina. We are hoping the new administration in that country will adopt a different outlook for foreign investors, and we hope we do not have to leave Argentina as we did in Venezuela due to political and economic instability. Brazil represents the market with the greatest potential in Latin America, producing $4 billion in annual revenue. We have invested for four years in learning how to operate there. Their regulations heavily benefit the country, but are less convenient for foreign investors. Therefore, we decided to manufacture within the country to reduce import costs. A plant will be opened within three years to cover all the needs of that market. We have grown by 42% in Brazil this year. Peru remains our number one market in Latin America and we are continuously growing. Colombia and Ecuador are consolidated as well, and we have learned to work under the new conditions established by President Correa in Ecuador. We are also growing considerably in Chile.<br></p><h4>Can you tell us about the new plants that the company is investing in?<br></h4><p>We are opening three new plants in Guadalajara, one for aromas, one for essences and another for the production of active ingredients to manufacture our final products. We will also produce a new skin care cosmetic line, with a clearer connection to Omnilife. In total, we will have four plants in Mexico. Around 300 new jobs will be created at these new plants. This figure will grow as we start producing for other companies. There are very few manufacturing companies for aromas in Latin America and we want to enter that market.<br></p><h4>Going back a few years, can you tell us what opportunities you saw by purchasing Chivas football club?<br></h4><p>The main reason for purchasing the club was to create a leading football club with the objective of modifying the cultural mindset in the country. Football players are the idols of the younger generation. Our aim is to foster a sense of teamwork among the Mexican population. The second reason was to purchase the second largest brand in the country, boasting 37 million fans in Mexico and the US. We wanted to expand the team and the brand, which we have accomplished so far, and we want to show that despite the large number of foreign players in the country, an all-Mexican team can become champions.<br></p><h4>How was the first half of 2015 for Omnilife and what are your expectations for 2016?<br></h4><p>It is a promising year. Our business in Mexico is growing by around 12-14% and Peru is growing 32%. Omnilife in the US is expected to grow by 28%, which will be a considerable accomplishment as it has always been a difficult market for us. We had originally focused our efforts on the Hispanic population, but we have been successful in expanding to the English-speaking population too.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the milestones that have characterized the company as a pioneer in the region?</h4><p>I believe the first milestone was the establishment of the company in the 1960s when Kuwait was initially developing its oil industry under the progressive leadership of HH Sheikh Abdullah Al-Salem Al-Sabah. At that time, however, most of the engineers or architects working in Kuwait were from abroad. The foundation of our company by a Kuwaiti national represented a major milestone. Although we grew consistently after this, the second milestone was the post-Gulf War period when numerous foreign employees were unable to return because of the sides their countries had taken during the war. Eventually, we had to start from scratch and rebuild the firm with whatever resources were available at that time. Our third milestone was when my father passed away and we were under pressure to continue seamlessly without him. In family-owned businesses, it is always a challenge to move from one generation to another and to hold on to the original business. The biggest challenge facing us is to update our business to keep up with emerging ideas and technologies and to introduce new ways of doing things, as many of our employees have been with us for a long time. Aside from expanding to new markets or diversifying our lines of business, we are currently recruiting recent graduates with innovative concepts who can change the work environment.</p><h4>What are the major projects you are currently involved in besides the new terminal at Kuwait International Airport?<br></h4><p>Whether we are talking about buildings or infrastructure, our projects typically have a long life cycle. Depending on the size of the project, the design phase can usually take two to four years while construction normally takes two to seven years. We are working on a number of different types of projects ranging from commercial units and offices to educational institutions and infrastructure. I always feel proud when we work on infrastructure projects that are vital to our country's economy. For example, we are involved in numerous road projects in Kuwait such as Cairo Street and the South Regional Road, also known as South Surra Road. This latter project will provide a direct connection to Jaber Hospital. These projects will eventually relieve pressure on Kuwait's congested road network. One of our most important projects is the new Mubarak Al-Kabeer port for which we partnered up with a British firm and Pace Architects to design the buildings. The potential economic consequences of this project are vast, as the majority of Kuwait ports run below capacity, which, in return, affect Kuwait's trade volumes. We are also working on the Kuwait Cancer Center as well as on numerous other hospitals for both the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Public Works. For example we recently completed the Jaber Hospital project and are looking to tender the Kuwait Police Hospital by the end of the year. In addition, we are currently involved in the expansion of the Scientific Center. Moreover, another project we are looking to become involved in is the design of irrigation networks for treated sewage water, which is important for landscaping and agriculture and prevents treated water from being dumped into the sea as this could cause an environmental problem in Kuwait Bay. Another sanitation project we are hoping to work on is a large treatment plant which was tendered through the Partnerships Technical Bureau (PTB). Outside of Kuwait, we have also started to take on projects in Sudan and Bahrain through the Kuwait Fund for Development. However, in all circumstances, wherever our operations expand to, we seek to provide a value-added service to local communities and to associate with local companies in order to share knowledge and transfer our experience.<br></p><h4>With which major partners are you currently collaborating?</h4><p>We worked with the Kuwait Direct Investment Promotion Authority (KDIPA) on a number of master plans for an 18sqm economic zone. KDIPA could be a major potential partner going forward if we can develop these plots and sell to direct investors. The great thing about KDIPA is that it turned from a foreign investment into a direct investment authority. Accordingly, these lands could also be developed by Kuwaiti companies, which is important because Kuwaiti firms are liquid but lack domestic investment opportunities due to the lack of land. Additionally, we see the Public Authority for Housing as a large potential client given that they have a relatively new minister who has experience in the private sector. However, we primarily work with the government, most importantly the Ministry of Public Works, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Defense, and companies such as KNPC, KOC, and KOTC. We also are pleased to have the opportunity to work with KFAS, which is a great organization that was established by the government to promote science. Increasingly we are gaining clients from the private sector as well. Although we have not established a lot of relationships with big real estate companies, we did work with Tamdeen Real Estate Company as a client for one project<br></p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>With the PTB having tendered their projects and consequently brought new capital into the market, I am really optimistic about the coming year. The private sector will have another avenue for investing their money in Kuwait instead of taking it outside of the country. In fact, Kuwait has defied the low oil price environment and I do not see any slowdown in construction over coming years. Moreover, once KDIPA starts developing free trade zones, trade volumes are likely to skyrocket. On the other side the Touristic Enterprises Company (TEC) will be developing over 50 locations in Kuwait which will have an unparalleled impact on Kuwait's recreational sector. Infrastructure will also continue to represent a large part of the construction sector, as it continuously needs to be upgraded in response to the growth in population.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has your business model contributed to your regional expansion and what have been your most significant milestones?</h4><p>Azadea Group has always had a clear vision of where it wants to be. When we started back in 1978 with a franchise concept, the idea to develop this franchise grew on us and we decided to further learn the retail business and make a name of our own in this industry. We noticed that building a franchise was much easier than producing fabrics or manufacturing new brands that people would not recognize, so we brought some of the most popular brands from Europe to the Middle East, and we have had very successful expansion across the region. Our business model is based on setting a savvy team in each of the markets where we wish to operate and looking for new endeavors that will take Azadea further, whether by opening a new store, entering a new market, or bringing a new franchise. Today we have more than 50 international brands, and around 80% of them are in the fashion industry, with the rest being in the entertainment and food and beverages sectors. After achieving a fruitful expansion in the MENA region, we are now looking for opportunities to extend our networks in Sub-Saharan African countries such as Angola, Kenya, and others. </p><h4>How do you market your franchises to be successful in any new market you wish to open?</h4><p>There is a process that must be followed in order to bring in an already established brand and make it successful elsewhere. It is also a process that is learned over time, and it is necessary to have the right infrastructure and financial capacity to apply it. We have a dedicated team to each brand, and they are the ones doing the due diligence when entering a new market; they travel to meet the supplier, they get in-field training to fully understand the concept, they listen to the small details concerning the brand such as coordination, merchandising, pricing, and the like. This is pretty much how we set up stores for our franchises and why we have been successful in expanding to new markets.</p><h4>How do you adapt brands to conquer a new market and satisfy the needs of a certain market?</h4><p>It depends on how adaptable the brand is. Sometimes we can influence suppliers and they help us do a share of the collection adaptable to the market where we'll sell. For example, in Kuwait we sell maxi skirts, which we cannot sell in Europe but sell very well in the Gulf area. We cannot do the same window display in Saudi Arabia that we can do in Dubai or Beirut; each market has a different culture and we respect the culture of each market.</p><h4>As a Lebanese company, how do you manage to open spaces in foreign markets?</h4><p>We see ourselves as a regional company, which is why we set up offices in all the countries where we work, since we do not want to be an imported concept but a local one. This office serves our Lebanon operations but we have local headquarters in most countries of operation such as Dubai, Qatar, Jordan, and so on. Having said that, most of our employees are Lebanese, since we want to keep the spirit of Lebanese entrepreneurship at Azadea, complimented by over 100 nationalities that work at Azadea. Today, out of the 13 countries where we have presence, Lebanon represents only 12% of our operations.</p><h4>Has the current situation in Lebanon affected your sales in the country?</h4><p>This is an unpredictable market, and we have learned to live with this unpredictability over the years. Destiny plays a major role in the Lebanese market, as things might not always go as planned, but this does not mean that it has to be forever adverse. We are confident in the quality and marketable nature of the brands we sell. The country's volatility has never stopped Azadea Group from planning ahead and today we plan to incorporate five more brands into our portfolio, reaching a total of 55 by the end of the year.</p><h4>Azadea Foundation has carried out some interesting CSR projects in Lebanon. Can you tell us more about them?</h4><p>Our biggest landmark project is the Sanayeh Garden, a fully renovated 22,000sqm garden that we took under our possession to revive and inject green life into the central area of Beirut. The garden receives around 10,000 visitors daily, and we have created three different children's playgrounds with standards as high as those in Central Park in New York. There is a large fountain at the heart of the garden with greenery and grass all around it. Our commitment to this project involves taking over maintenance services to keep it alive and make it a sustainable project for years to come. We handle everything to do with the greenery and water maintenance, the cleanliness, and the security of the garden.</p><h4>With the increasing use of e-commerce, how is Azadea Group adapting to these changes?</h4><p>The access to purchase online has shifted some of the industry's needs in terms of attracting people. We used to open 50-100sqm stores in the past and this made it possible to have a greater number of them, but we have moved to bigger stores with different options within them, and a very high standard of customer service to cope with the changes in the market. The gap between e-commerce and traditional stores is still huge, and we need to bring the best practices into our outlets in order to coordinate stocks and have better availability than e-commerce shops.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What Measures is the Ministry taking to reverse or minimize the effects of current industry challenges?</h4><p>One thing this administration has been able to do is ensure that it takes advantage of the synergies amongst the different ministries, departments, agencies, and parastatals. We are seeing ourselves as one government out there to attain the same objective of serving to ameliorate the challenges facing our manufacturing sector. In terms of fiscal and monetary policies, there are a lot of discussions going on. We are aligning our fiscal and monetary policies for proper impact to be felt, especially by the manufacturing sector. Efforts are also being made to tackle energy issues, credit access, and forex problems. Recently, the Central Bank of Nigeria announced the dedication of 60% of all available forex for the manufacturing sector in addition to the adoption of a flexible forex regime.</p><h4>What type of incentives does the Ministry of Industry, Trade &amp; Investment provide for international investors?</h4><p>Nigeria is open for business and our main focus is on improving the business climate by creating a friendly environment for doing business. It is in that regards that President Muhammadu Buhari approved the establishment of the Presidential Council on Ease of Doing Business, saddled with the responsibility of removing all the bottlenecks that impede smooth business operations in the country. We have also signed numerous investment promotion and protection agreements with several countries to fast track investment flow. There are also comprehensive packages of incentives and relief, which are sector specific. For instance, the sugar sector has incentives such as development of free feasibility studies, provision of improved seed cane, long-term land lease of up to 99 years, in addition to the provision allowing all investors to legally repatriate profits. We have several investor attractive incentives such as the Export Expansion Grant, (EEG) and pioneer status (tax holiday for pioneer companies ranging between three and five years), which are currently under review and have been some of the biggest incentives enjoyed by investors. The revised waivers and incentives scheme will be taken to the federal executive council for approval. In the area of access to land and acquisition, discussions are ongoing with various state governments to facilitate access to land.</p><h4>Many large international industrial companies are in the country, how can the Ministry ensure that those investments translate into maximum benefits for Nigeria?</h4><p>The Ministry is focused on the implementation of the Nigerian Industrial Revolution Plan (NIRP) and the Nigerian Enterprise Development Programme (NEDEP). These are policies aimed at boosting industrialization and support for the micro, small and medium enterprises and furthermore ensure that the benefits of all investments are fully tapped, especially the provision of jobs for our large young population and improved contribution to GDP. This provides a platform for the implementation of the industrial, trade, and investment policies of the government, on the foundations of macroeconomic stability and fundamental improvements in the enabling environment for doing business in Nigeria. We are currently finalizing the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment (MITI)'s diversification and growth plan to: create an enabling environment for industry, trade, and investment; implement the Nigerian Industrial Revolution Plan (NIRP); attract domestic and foreign investment; support MSMEs; and, facilitate market access and integration of Nigerian manufacturers and service providers into regional and global value chains through multilateral negotiations and FTAs.</p><h4>In Nigeria, there is still a significant informal economy. How is the ministry working to move these SMEs into the formal economy?</h4><p>Providing support for the MSMEs is a focal pillar in our ministry's growth and diversification plan. Nigeria is estimated to have about 37 million SMEs right now, of which 36 million are informal. That represents a huge amount of potential that has not been harnessed. We are working toward introducing some concessions to the MSMEs to reduce the informal/formal gap by reducing the cost of company incorporation and other regulatory certifications with some government agencies, e.g. NAFDAC, SON, and CAC. Several interventions have failed to yield the desired results in the past, due mainly to the blanket approach to issues from distinctive business categorizations. The new strategy is anchored on providing tailored interventions in terms of regulations, tax incentives, and waivers for SMEs so that there is differentiation between micro and small, and then small and medium, to facilitate further growth and sustainability. This will encourage the formalization of the informal, and stimulate the reduction of the formal-informal gap by 50% over the next three years. We are also talking with big companies to extend lines of credit to micro businesses with some guarantee by their business associations. This will provide an alternative funding opportunity and build up financial inclusion by encouraging these small businesses to open bank accounts.</p><h4>What role do you expect the Special and Industrial Economic Zones to play in promoting trade and industry in the country?</h4><p>The special economic zones will assist in overcoming the infrastructural and logistical disadvantages faced by manufacturing and industrial businesses in Nigeria, principally power and transportation. This will be achieved by promoting the clusters and value chain effects to be gained by locating similar export oriented manufacturing businesses within the same locality. They will also create a large number of jobs through backward integration and provision of industry related services, especially in light manufacturing in addition to improved specialization. On a related note, they are going to help our export portfolio with the much-needed forex inflow into the economy.</p><h4>Which industries hold the biggest potential for investment in the near future?</h4><p>Agriculture, solid minerals, industry, and technology have big potential in the future and could play a vital role in our diversification and growth efforts. Cement, for example, with the backward integration policy has moved Nigeria from being leading importer of cement to becoming not only self -sufficient, but also a net exporter. Other sectors in which we are looking to replicate such attainments are fertilizers and leather, considering our vast fertile landmass and abundant animal husbandry. In agriculture, we are looking at massive rice and wheat production and their possible export potential by working on the whole value chain. Nigeria is also rich in a number of commodities like the cashew nuts, shea butter, cocoa, tomato, and many other products that can be exported. We are now working toward building production capacities, quality, and competitiveness.</p><h4>What should be done to empower and unleash the potential of girls and women in Nigeria and in Africa? </h4><p>Education is Key here, and girls need to be educated. School enrolment represents the largest component in human capital investment. Education bestows on girls and women a disposition for lifelong socio-economic skills. It is essential therefore that both governments and the private sector encourage and institute scholarships specially dedicated to the promotion of girl child education. Women make up over 60% of SME ownerships and have the highest rate of loan repayment. It is however ironic that this demographic faces the most daunting of challenges in business in terms of access to land and finance. We need to create more opportunities that provide access to finance and markets for women. Businesses and industries should be encouraged to see the importance of employing women in the workplace and the advantages it brings to efficiency and business sustainability. We need to give women more opportunities and roles to play. We need to be challenged the more, and acknowledged for the good and exceptional work that we are doing. </p><h4>What are your expectations for 2017?</h4><p> I expect 2017 to be a fantastic year for Nigeria. This administration has worked hard toward laying a solid foundation in the three key focal areas of anti-corruption, security, and the economy. There were challenges with the 2016 budget, and in order to avert reoccurrence, work has already commenced on the 2017 budget with embedded mitigating factors deliberately factored in. Today, the population has an unalloyed confidence in the political leadership of the country being steered by President Muhammadu Buhari; they believe in the potential that Nigeria has, and that belief is very important and central for the success of any development plan. That is why 2017 is going to be a great and exceptional year.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Where do WIEF and its conferences make the most impact?</h4><p>Around 10 to 12 years ago, the Islamic world, in particular those under the umbrella of the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC), was neglecting issues relating to the economy and economic development. The OIC was mainly geopolitical, a UN restricted to Muslim countries. With that objective in mind, the WIEF was established on the sidelines of an OIC summit. We organized an annual economic symposium for several years until the initial issues became politicized. When the OIC came under the chairmanship of Malaysia, our prime minister decided to set up this economic cooperation under a separate organization—this was the beginning of WIEF, though still under the patronage of the OIC. A research organization was assigned the responsibility of organizing the launch and I was appointed chairman. We had our first meeting in Kuala Lumpur in 2006, where we addressed a broad range of topics with more than 400 high-level executives from all over the world. It was my vision from the beginning to have as the main objective improving the livelihood of the Muslim society at large. None of our activities, therefore, touch on issues related to religion or political ideology. The word spread that we were truly interested in talking about business, and thus we could bring a large number of Muslim and non-Muslim businessmen together. For politics or religion, there are already hundreds of other think tanks; we strictly discuss business, and that is our unique selling point. Today, we have an average attendance of 2,500 people at each conference. We recognize that many Muslim communities around the world live in disadvantaged positions and we want to empower these people. For example, Indonesia has around 56 million SMEs, contributing almost 90% of the GDP; with a bottom-up approach you can see how important these are for the global economy, especially in developing countries. </p><h4>How can we evolve the discussion forward between Muslim nations and what is the ultimate goal of the forum?</h4><p>The ultimate goal is to have all participating countries align agendas for the economic development of their respective nations and to enter the mainstream global economy. The conference has five main topics. The first is infrastructure, which is a primary enabler of economic development. Second is halal tourism, and we increasingly look at global destinations to build this tourism segment. Third is Islamic fashion, which is under rapid development, with global demand for modest fashion. Furthermore, we look into Islamic finance and creative industries. With this broad range of topics, we will find enough common ground.</p><h4>Do you think the process for making that happen should mirror the ideas of this forum?</h4><p>We need the willpower of the countries concerned to be all-inclusive; their business and political leaders should recognize the relevance of this global discussion. We want them to show their concern for the well-being of the people. Economic development should not recognize boundaries or have limitations—that is as political as we will go during this forum. Regardless of their religion, region, or country, anyone participating should accept this basic principle. Non-Muslim businesspeople join our events as well. The obvious objective is development at the highest level. Islamic should not just mean religious, but rather good corporate governance, green, and environmentally friendly. Employment should be fair as well, and this is one of the reasons we are pushing forward the agenda for Islamic finance. The western well-established financial system has suddenly collapsed and we want to move the financial industry to operate ethically again. In Islamic finance, there are still risks when you invest; however, the difference is that these risks are shared. It is not relevant whether this practice is just Islamic, it can include practices by the Norwegian government as well—it is perhaps even more Islamic than some Islamic countries in terms of its practices. Islamic finance has caught fire as never expected. In Malaysia, the majority of customers are non-Muslim Chinese people who understand their money is safe here. </p><h4>How do you think Muslim nations can work together to convey their ambitions to investors around the world?</h4><p><span></span>Islamic finance and banking are still relatively new because the western system has been established since the early beginnings of the banking industry. In 2013, we held the WIEF in London—the first time we did it in a non-Muslim country—on its invitation. A year later, the UK government launched a sukuk fund totaling GBP200 million, which was 10 times oversubscribed. This made it clear that the demand for honest and ethical lending systems, for safety and security, and for wealth sharing in the system is large in many places. Although we keep WIEF a low-key conference—we hardly advertise—in 10 years we have grown to become a global reference point. We want to spread the word about the opportunities that Islamic finance offers; the biggest contractors in the world can now turn to issuing sukuk to raise capital for their infrastructural projects. The challenge is that many prejudices and fears about Islam still exist. We have a cultural agenda as well, and on the sidelines of the forum we organize a Marketplace of Creative Arts, a place for young people to get involved in dance, music, fashion, and film. </p><h4>What are your ambitions for WIEF?<br></h4><p>We are not an institution that forms or passes resolutions. Rather, we provide our participants the opportunity to meet each other to engage in global business. We simply facilitate and are glad to see many young, new, and international people together. Our ambition is to grow, not in terms of size, but in the range of topics we discuss. We now have activities for the entrepreneurial development of women and a young fellows program. Under the WIEF umbrella, we have events in 20 cities every year. Businesses like to do their signing ceremonies at our forum and we greatly encourage this. The business conducted here is worth billons, and though it is not just about the numbers, it shows the relevance of this meeting. It is amazing to see how we are able to facilitate this and how WIEF has developed in the past 10 years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the reasons for pioneering the independent power and water producers (IWPP) model in the UAE?</h4><p>Abu Dhabi is the pioneer in the region to promote IWPP and other reforms in the water and electricity sector. We view IWPP as a commercial business in which everyone participates in tendering exercises and the one with the best price will be awarded the unit. It is good for business to have certain activities managed commercially, such that people are more conscious of the cost and management, the rationalization, and cost reduction in order to maximize profit. This has resulted in low-cost electricity generation and water production and timely completion of the production plant. The model has been successful in attracting private investment and expertise in the electricity and water sectors and in meeting power and water demands in a timely and efficient manner.</p><h4>Who will be the main beneficiary of new prices amidst the price war among generation companies?</h4><p>Competition, falling costs, and other factors have resulted in significantly lower generation prices from photovoltaic (PV) solar projects. The electricity price achieved for the third phase of Dubai solar project is indeed commendable. Such prices are more favorable than conventional methods, particularly gas-based, generation. More importantly, this diversity increases security for the customers at affordable prices. Any cost saving will be reflected in the unit cost that will be passed on to the customer. Right now, many customers—commercial, industrial, or residential—have different government subsidies, so whatever is gained will be passed onto the customer or the government itself. Where customers already pay full cost tariffs, the gain will be passed on to them. There is an annual price increase of about 5%, which is unlike three or four years ago, when the annual increase was much higher. The planning function within the Emirate has evolved significantly in recent years with more sophisticated energy.</p><h4>What are your thoughts on desalination, and how can the technology be improved?</h4><p>Traditionally, gas-fired power plants have been the mainstay of UAE generation, which was coupled with the traditional thermal desalination process. Desalination in all its forms is an expensive process with energy-intensive needs. However, we are able to reduce the energy required through the use of reverse osmosis together with energy recovery systems. The new Mirfa plant and two plants at Fujairah are applying this system, which provides efficiency advantages over standalone thermal desalination facilities. In addition, we are closely monitoring the Masdar pilot research project to identify emerging technologies with the potential to scale up accordingly in the future. The UAE and Abu Dhabi are committed to improving the security of supply through diversifying the overall energy mix within the country. There is now a significant focus on leveraging favorable market conditions for PV solar technology. Given the large swings of power demand between summer and winter and relatively flatter demand for water throughout the year, we have been planning and working to decouple water production from electricity generation. Reverse osmosis rather than conventional desalination will likely emerge as a more suitable technology.</p><h4>How are tariffs creating another steady and secure revenue source for the government?</h4><p>There was one increase in electricity and water tariffs on January 1, 2015 for all customer categories. We should also note that all government organizations now pay full-cost reflective tariffs as a result of the 2015 tariff reforms. The other customer category paying the cost-reflective tariffs is expat residential customers with high consumption. These tariff reforms are an effective way to encourage our customers to value energy sources and manage their consumption more wisely. To date the government has subsidized water and electricity, but the plan is to reform this subsidy regime over time. This is in line with our green and red campaign a few years ago, where the purpose was to give targets for customers to stay in the green and avoid the red as much as possible.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The forecast for Costa Rica's growth in 2016 is around 4.2%. What are the country's main economic drivers?</h4><p>Our estimation is for growth is 4.2% and it could be a little higher, as we have had five consecutive months around 5% growth, which is an encouraging sign. Most of the driving force has to do with tourism, which has grown very strongly, as well as investments in medical devices and exports in that field, which have been significant. Costa Rica has also received important investments in services, including those in back offices supporting businesses from here, which has also been a substantial difference compared to other years. In the agricultural sector, we just received good news regarding the banana segment, which has exceeded all expectations. If the weather continues as it has been this year, as opposed to the bad weather last year, we will go over all the statistics since 2007, which means that we could be at the height of the biggest banana exports that the country has had in many years. That is also on the rise, therefore I am quite optimistic that the performance will be either as it currently is or better.</p><h4>FDI in Costa Rica increased to USD2.8 billion in 2015. What is your outlook for 2016, and what are you doing to increase this figure?</h4><p>The investment numbers have been steadily climbing in Costa Rica at a rate of around 14% per year, and that has been the case for the last two or three years. This is important because it indicating that the strategy we are pursuing is successful; we are promoting seriously the investments even with the President as one of its actors. I travel and meet with many other leaders; we go to Silicon Valley, New York, Chicago, and cities in Europe where we meet with people, which provides the necessary energy that culminates in more reposed and strategically orientated work that our investment promotion industry, CINDE, develops, as well as the work that Procomer, our export promotion agency, develops. Word-of-mouth reference accounts for about 50% of all investments that we receive in Costa Rica, which have been here for a long time. It is an action they have repeated through the years because they are happy with the system, and so one of the things we do all the time is invite those interested in working in and investing in Costa Rica to come and talk with people who are already working here. This has been phenomenal because they hear from other businessmen and women what they are doing and what the conditions of the country are. </p><h4>Are there any particular countries or regions from which you are trying to increase foreign investment?<br></h4><p>We are looking at the whole world. Costa Rica is one of the most open economies in the world, with access through FTAs or relations to 2.5 billion people, which is a significant number. We do this on a general and a global basis because of the geographical closeness and because of our traditional linkages in the past, whereby most of our investments came from the US and Western Europe. However, we have seen other strategically important investments coming from China, Korea, and Australia. Our overall strategy remains broadly focused. </p><h4>What aspects of Costa Rica make it an attractive destination for investment?</h4><p>We have been investing in public education for over 150 years. Costa Rica had its first public girls' school 10 years before we became a republic, so this is an ongoing priority that we have kept strongly. We believe deeply in forming our citizens, and it shows. After so many years, we have developed a number of qualities in the workforce that are extraordinary. We are close to the timelines in the US and closer to Europe than India or China, and this facilitates business connections. The second thing is connectivity and we have dozens of air connections to Europe and the US every day, which is particularly important for certain industries. We currently have four direct flights from Madrid, Zurich, Paris and London. Another factor is that there is a business culture in Costa Rica that is easy to link with the practices of elsewhere, not only in terms of procedures, but also language proficiency in English or French. There is an accumulated experience that has also created an attractive incentive regime. This has been an ongoing process for over 30 years now, and we have been able to negotiate FTAs with over 12 nations or blocs of nations. The fact that we have access to these markets further adds to an already attractive situation. Then, there are other business aspects, such as Costa Rica's political stability. This is a country with a strong judiciary; we have one of the lowest crime rates in Latin America. This is a small country, but it is livable. The cost of living is higher than in other places because, among other reasons, of our social regimes, and social security in particular. Costa Rica is a country that many like because of its nature and the fact that we have almost 100% renewable energy. All of these are parts of a country persona that makes Costa Rica an attractive spot to invest in. </p><h4>What is being done on to address the fiscal deficit, and what is the significance of the reform in the accession of Costa Rica to the Pacific Alliance and the OECD?</h4><p>We defined since the political campaign that this would be the core issue of our administration. The fiscal deficit went from 2% to 6% in less than a decade, and 15 years later we are defining a small reform that would increase VAT by 2%. We have divided into nine bills the different reforms for income and expenditures, four of which have already been approved and two are about to be voted on by the legislative assembly. We have not yet discussed the two big income projects, which are the transformation of the sales tax and income tax, which at 13% is ridiculous compared to the services that Costa Rica seeks. We want high-standard services but do not want to pay for them—good democracies are not cheap. This negatively affects our accession to the Pacific Alliance and the OECD because if we do not have the financial sustainability that Costa Rica requires, we cannot make the most of the advantages an FTA has to offer, nor can we compensate for the negative effects that these agreements can have upon certain sectors of the economy, particularly agriculture. Our unemployment rate is around 9%, and if we are not careful this could escalate. I would not want to imagine Costa Rica collapsing because the fiscal deficit accompanied by a high external debt put us in an impossible situation. We need that reform to be successful.</p><h4>How is the accession to the OECD progressing, and do you see this happening by the end of your mandate?</h4><p>I hope so, as I have seen it progressing well thus far. In a general sense, the organization is happy, advances have been significant, and there are areas in which Costa Rica is far beyond what would be expected from a country of our size with an economy as relatively vulnerable as ours. In clean energies, for example, we exceed OECD.</p><h4>Public infrastructure is one of the key elements holding back Costa Rica's competitiveness.  How are PPPs contributing to the development of the sector?</h4><p>We are starting the PPP process. The experience has been short and in some cases unpleasant.  Concessions that the government has made have been negative because the opacity and lack of transparency in airport and road projects generated many doubts regarding the convenience of advancing further. PPPs remain the way forward into the future.</p><h4>2015 ended with a poverty rate of 23%. What have been the most successful initiatives, and what else is being done to reduce this figure?<br></h4><p>The most important initiative is “Puente al Desarrollo," which looks at taking 57,800 families out of extreme poverty. At the moment, we have around 28,000 families incorporated into social processes after guaranteeing they are the ones that truly require government support. We are on the second stage of recruiting the remaining 28,000 families. This exercise addresses social inclusion by incorporating these families into formation processes, employment, technical training, and overall improvements in living conditions.</p><h4>What are your priorities in the region?</h4><p>Central America and the Caribbean is a natural area for us to relate to well. I like to think of the immediate region as almost an extension of our local markets, as it is an area in which we compete particularly favorably. Obviously, the US and Europe are significant markets; over 50% of what we import and export comes from and goes to the US. We are probably the largest partner of the EU in Central America, which is significant in terms of our exports as well. We are also active with Latin America beyond the greater Caribbean area. Our relations with Chile and Peru are significant, and the likelihood of an agreement between Costa Rica and the Pacific Alliance is still there, though this is a decision that will have to be made after we solve the most significant economic problem we have today, which is the deficit. Again, we are interested in pursuing trade relations with Asia. We have an FTA with China, which is significant. We are interested and have a longstanding relationship with Japan, but the closer circles of investment are priorities because of the importance they have in our overall matrix.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>MotoGP started racing on Sepang International Circuit in 1999, even before the first Formula One race. How has the Malaysian leg of MotoGP changed over 17 years?</h4><p>As with any international event, the Malaysian Grand Prix is constantly evolving and improving. With better safety, improved fan facilities, and an incredible and growing fan presence, the MotoGP race at Sepang is one of the most exciting on the calendar and we are proud of our status as one of the largest and best motorsport events in Asia.</p><h4>The Sepang track was designed by Hermann Tilke and has maintained the same configuration since opening in 1999. Do you think it can evolve with the times and the changes that MotoGP has seen?</h4><p>Sepang is a modern track and has been a global frontrunner since it was conceived, designed, and opened. The layout creates incredible wheel-to-wheel action and gives fans great views of their on-track heroes, with the Main Grandstand complex especially proving one of the most spectacular and iconic on the MotoGP calendar. Counting on ever-improving safety additions as well as new asphalt in 2016 and some new cambers, the evolution of Sepang makes sure it maintains its status as one of Asia, and the world's, most prestigious motor racing venues.</p><h4>Because of the intense heat and high humidity, the Malaysian race is considered a challenging and exciting one. What makes the Sepang race spectacular?</h4><p>The physical challenge of riding in the Malaysian heat is one of the things that makes winning the Malaysian Grand Prix such a prestigious award. The layout of the track—especially the final hairpin—also lends itself perfectly to wheel-to-wheel racing and the venue has staged some of the most iconic moments in two-wheeled sport. In addition, the Malaysian weather and threat of rain is another added ingredient that makes Sepang so special, as it can be another exciting addition to the MotoGP weekend.</p><h4>Formula One has helped to put Malaysia and Petronas on the global map. How do you think MotoGP has contributed to Malaysia's reputation in the world?</h4><p>MotoGP has always had fantastic participation from Asia and has a long history of racing on the continent. It was a natural step for the world's biggest motorcycling world championship to make Sepang International Circuit a permanent home for MotoGP in Malaysia, with Malaysian involvement in the championship going back a long time—from previous sponsorship from Petronas in the 250 World Championship to the DRIVE M7 SIC racing team on the Moto3 grid in 2016. In addition, 2016 saw the country's first GP win, as Khairul Idham Pawi took his first victory in the Gran Premio de la República Argentina in Moto3.</p><h4>What are your expectations for this year's race?</h4><p>I expect another spectacular showdown to showcase the best of the MotoGP grid and the best of the Sepang International Circuit. With another incredible season of racing in the MotoGP in 2016, the stage is set for the world's greatest to once again take to the Malaysian asphalt for another classic encounter. With Marc Márquez leading the way from key rivals Valentino Rossi, Jorge Lorenzo, and Dani Pedrosa, the battle at the front is as tight as ever and will again light up the Malaysian venue as the season finale approaches and the championship goes down to the wire.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have trade relations between the UK and Colombia grown since BRITCHAM's establishment in 1981, and what role has the chamber played in that development?</h4><p>We are celebrating our 35th anniversary. The chamber was created by a group of British companies that established their business operations in Colombia. It was initially supported by the ambassador, and now we are celebrating the benefits of our bilateral relationship in different sectors, with the most important being oil and gas and mining. With time there have been many other sectors that have grown between Colombia and the UK, such as infrastructure, automobiles, machinery, and equipment for heavy industry, spirits, liquor, and pharmaceuticals. In terms of Colombian exports to the UK, we have expanded our trade volumes for petrol, coal, nickel, and one of the most important exports of late has been palm oil, which has already seen a lot of growth and potential for exporting to countries beyond the UK. That is one of the most interesting new products that we have been developing for the last 12-14 years. We see the UK as an important supporter and ally for Colombia, as it is one of the most important of the three largest foreign investors in our country. The UK government watches Latam as a potential region to invest and Colombia as one of the most stable economies. We find that we have an interesting future as commercial partners.</p><h4>What are some of the sectors that are particularly attractive to British investors?</h4><p>One of the most important sectors now is definitely infrastructure, due to the government's Fourth Generation Infrastructure plan. There are many companies interested in learning more about the opportunities to invest. One such company is Holdtrade, which is developing an important rail project from La Dorada to the Santa Marta port.</p><h4>What are some of the advantages in terms of attracting investors that Colombia has over other countries in the region?</h4><p>When people make the decision to invest it is because we have economic stability, which is one of the most important issues for foreign investors. At the moment, we are carrying out the peace process, which has already succeeded in attracting worldwide media to our country. We hope the government with the next structural tax reforms will help companies to be able to define a strategy for investing here. We have a privileged location; therefore, Colombia is investing in ports to increase its competitiveness for goods and prices to internal transportation, distribution, and logistics. We do not have a political problem at the moment as do countries like Brazil, Venezuela, or potentially even Argentina. By comparison, Colombia has been providing a source of stability and relatively important growth for investors. Our people are of course another asset, and international surveys regularly show Colombia to be one of the happiest countries in the world, making it easier to attract personnel from abroad.</p><h4>How do you foresee the uncertainty surrounding Brexit affecting trade and investment between the two countries?</h4><p>The potential effect of Brexit is an interesting subject of analysis for economists around the world. The vote is over and we have to work and start thinking about the consequences and turn them into advantages. Colombia is a close ally of the UK, and we protect our allies. We are suggesting that the government sit with the UK government. We have the EU trade agreement, which was negotiated for so many years that it is part of what we can maintain with the UK in a bilateral agreement, so the negative effects on Colombian exports should be minimal. We have always had the visa procedure, so we are accustomed to it. The sterling pound has always been a strong currency and will likely remain so. We try to promote the benefits of an interesting trade relationship between the two countries, with more trade visits. Our top commercial partner remains, of course, the US, but we ask our entrepreneurs to come with us to the UK and be trained in industries like agribusiness and textiles, where there is a potential interest. This is part of what we will try to achieve in terms of bilateral trade; however, we will also have to strengthen our commercial and cultural ties. Politically, we are already on course thanks to the planned state visit of President Santos to the UK in November, and we expect this to have that an interesting effect on our trade relations and economic performance. We feel that after their democratic decision we just have to make the best out of it, but they have to be active, fast, and intelligent, as there are many companies around the world supporting businesses with the UK. Their plans should not be underestimated; they will come up with something superbly interesting that could perhaps lead to stabilization in other economies in a similar situation, Catalonia being one obvious example.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[joint-steps]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Considering Oman's push toward economic diversification, what is the scope of the recent technical cooperation agreement signed between the World Bank and Oman?</h4><p>The World Bank has had a decades-long partnership with the Sultanate of Oman, providing technical assistance across several sectors and on important reforms. The agreement we recently signed with Oman focuses on supporting the implementation of the new development plan. Some of the areas for which the World Bank is advising the Omani government relate to the core development challenges facing the Gulf region, such as job creation and economic diversification. To address these challenges, the region must focus on reforms that give more room for private sector initiatives, improve education and skills, reform the non-targeted subsidy schemes, and improve labor market regulations. The bank is working with the Omani government to identify key impediments to private-sector growth and to improve the investment climate. We are advising on policy recommendations to enhance competitiveness, diversify the economy, and generate employment. The bank is also supporting improvements to the education system to ensure Omani students are equipped with 21st-century skills and enhancing officials' policy formulation and implementation capacity. In the Gulf, often times, public spending is not reflected in the outcomes; therefore, with the assistance of the bank, Oman's Ministries of Finance, Education, and Health are completing two public expenditure reviews in education and health to assess expenditures, the efficiency of inputs, and the extent of outcomes achieved. The World Bank is also supporting the Central Bank of Oman to develop a national payments system strategy to modernize the payment system in Oman. As it takes strides toward the future, Oman is also keen to bring its traditional industries forward. Omanis have requested the bank to link the government's investment program in the fisheries sector to their vision of private-sector led growth, while maintaining sustainable management of this natural resource. We are proud to work with the Omani government to ensure that our engagements transfer knowledge, develop institutions, and enhance capacity.</p><h4>SMEs are seen as vital instruments in achieving sustainable diversification for GCC countries. How would you assess the Omani banking sector's support for SME growth and what further measures can the country take in this regard?</h4><p>We know that two factors drive diversification and job growth: the ability of firms to start and their ability to grow. The Omani government has set up several programs to support financing for micro and small enterprises; however, SMEs still report “access to finance" as one of their top constraints. This limitation affects medium-sized firms more than small or large firms. Distrust by commercial banks and scarce equity financing create a “missing middle" of capital for medium and growing enterprises. Banks are less likely to finance medium-sized firms than small and large enterprises and, when they are financed, it is at higher interest rates and with higher collateral requirements. Legal and institutional reforms, as well as regulations, are still required to enhance access to finance for SMEs. Oman's credit infrastructure should be strengthened, which includes improving the credit information system and introducing a secured transaction law, as well as a modern collateral registry for movable assets. We need to make sure public sector programs that support SME financing are designed effectively and efficiently and that their results are continuously evaluated. Another measure Oman should consider is to encourage banking competition. While Oman's banking sector is less concentrated than other countries in the GCC, the top-five banks still account for 80% of total market share.</p><h4>What were some of the advancements made in Oman that assisted the country in its 11-point jump in the World Bank's most recent Logistics Performance Index?</h4><p>Oman has made major improvements to its trade logistics. With Oman's strategic location, it has the potential to become an important international sea transport route and a logistics gateway to the region. In terms of ease of trading across borders, it is a top performer in the region. In doing business 2016, it came second only to Jordan when compared to its neighbors, and Omani firms do not perceive customs and trade regulations as a major constraint. The Omani government has worked diligently on easing the processes related to customs and trade, which is reflected in its ranking. In 2016, the government established an online one-stop shop, “Bayan," for clearing customs. The Bayan declaration processing e-Service enables importers or exporters to declare and clear the goods with Customs, while the Bayan Manifest processing e-Service enables the online submission and registration of manifest for shipping agents and freight forwarders/consolidators. In 2015, Oman passed a major reform whereby it reduced the time for border compliance for both exporting and importing by transferring cargo operations from Sultan Qaboos Port to Sohar Port, which resulted in an improvement in seven ranking spots on Trading across Borders between the doing business in 2015 and 2016 reports.</p><h4>What joint steps being taken to expedite the execution of the articles of cooperation between Oman's Ministry of Finance and the World Bank, as well as steps to develop public financial systems in Oman? <br></h4><p>The Ministry of Finance is keen on connecting Omani entities to access World Bank advisory services. World Bank assistance always focuses on knowledge transfer and strengthening capacity across its engagements. Our support to Oman is focused on improving governance and institutional capacity in the country. The World Bank's ability to convene powers and facilitate dialogue among stakeholders on various economic and sector policy issues is well regarded. The World Bank has an excellent relationship with the Omani government and our programs with Oman have been wide-ranging. World Bank engagements range from support to the core economic entities in Oman, the Ministry of Finance, the Supreme Council for Planning, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, and the Central Bank, including coordination among those entities as well as Ministries of Transport, Agriculture and Fisheries, Social Development, and Education. Our collaboration with the Ministry of Finance in the area of public financial management is progressing very well. I had excellent discussions with HE the Minister on these reforms during my last visit to Oman in April 2016 and during the World Bank/IMF meetings in Washington DC this past October. There is a clear vision and ownership for the reforms that HE the Minister and his team is championing and we are glad to be an effective partner to the Ministry in supporting these envisaged reforms.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[It’s a Deal]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[its-a-deal]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe your client base in Kuwait?</h4><p>In Kuwait, we represent most of the country's financial institutions, working with eight out of 10 banks and also some foreign banks. Secondly, we work on infrastructure deals. Kuwait is involved in many large-scale PPP deals, and we work on many of those. In some of those we represent the state of Kuwait and in others we represent the consortia or the lenders. For example, we are representing two or three consortia on the Al-Zour Water &amp; Power project. The Kuwait Solid Waste Management Project is another big infrastructure project where we represent two consortia. In addition, we are still representing the government on the Abdaliyah Solar Energy project and another consortium in another PPP project for schools. When representing the government, we are working to protect the government in terms of documentation on concession contracts and so forth. When representing a consortium, on the other hand, we are doing a lot of JV agreements between the companies, reviewing and submitting bids. And if we are on the lender's side, we represent the lender's package and interests. At this time, we have 22 lawyers at our Kuwait firm and a total of 360 lawyers in the region, so we can also always call on our lawyers from other offices in the region like Dubai for assistance when and where needed. We are first in the market here in Kuwait, for starters. But we do also have 16 offices region-wide, with five offices in the UAE; we are in all the GCC states, we have two offices in Saudi Arabia in Riyadh and Jeddah, we are in Iraq and Jordan, and now we also have a 15-man team in Cairo. No other regional firm can compete with us. We are specialists in each country's law, and we are also very diverse, with one-third of our lawyers across the region being Westerners, a third from the Levant, and the remaining third being local law firms that specialize in that country's law and litigation. We have a very good mix that covers everything and various languages as well. We further have a large finance team to draft finance documentation, a large corporate team, as well as a large litigation team for the deals that encounter problems. We are very well placed and probably first or second in terms of size for the type of services we offer.</p><h4>What are the projects you will be focusing on in the year ahead?</h4><p>The PPP deals are still going ahead. There has been a change in the regime of the Kuwait Authority for Partnership Programs (KAPP), which superseded PTB as the regulatory body. Overall, we expect to close two PPP deals over the next year. One will be financing the KNPC and the Clean Fuels Project, and we will do a third tranche as well with foreign lenders. I expect the next two tranches to close this year, which is important for the Clean Fuels Project to go forward. We will still continue with KDIPA and I expect it to issue another five to eight licenses over the next year for foreign companies doing business here. This is great because it is going to be bringing in new technologies and hiring Kuwaitis, so that will be promising for the country. We also still have some M&amp;A deals and the regular finance work that pops up as well. So it is still a busy year, especially compared to other parts of the Gulf where there has been a big slowdown. In Kuwait, the authorities are still spending a lot on infrastructure projects, which keeps us all busy and the economy ticking.</p><h4>What do you think are some of the most important recent legal reforms that have benefited Kuwaiti businesses?</h4><p>In the last five years, we have seen so much new legislation and so many new regulatory bodies. The CMA has been around for three or four years, and it issued new by-laws in November 2015, 1,700 pages worth of them, some old, some reinstated. That has been very helpful in terms of getting more investors into the country. KDIPA's foreign investment laws have been very helpful in particular for the country. We have a new telecoms regulatory body to regulate the telecoms sector and the internet companies. Our company's law was overhauled a couple of years ago, and we can do a lot of things that we could not do before under the older companies law regime in terms of share allocation, management, and so forth. PTB has a new PPP law and by-laws are in place that are more lender friendly and a lot more of our deals will be considered bankable. Of course, it will take time for some ministries to come up to speed on the new legislation, but I would go so far as to say that the legislation that has come out in Kuwait is better than anywhere else in the Gulf right now. The rest of the region is behind us on PPP laws by two or three years, except perhaps Saudi Arabia in respect to the CMA. The new CMA laws make it a lot easier for the banks to collateralize assets. Previously, it took years to foreclose on assets. That has not been tested yet but I think it will be very helpful. With a lot of these deals it is a question of making sure lenders are comfortable with the risk they are taking and, if they put up collateral, they will be able to take it in the event of a default.</p><h4>What is your specific outlook for 2017?</h4><p>Because of low oil prices, it will be a challenging environment. That being said, Kuwait is in a better financial position than a lot of the other GCC countries. Kuwait has decent reserves. It will still have an effect but not as bad as in other states. Kuwait will slow down a bit, but infrastructure projects will continue. It is a tough neighborhood, of course, but security-wise we are okay and in relatively good shape. The one good thing about the drop in oil prices is that rents and real estate have gone down, which makes it easier to attract talent. The cost of living was getting extremely expensive here, and that has changed in the last 12 months due to low oil prices. So we expect a decent year and are generally optimistic.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How ICE evolved since it was establishes in 1949?</h4><p>ICE was created due to a dissent that existed in the electrical supply in Costa Rica, which was in the hands of the private foreign sector with poor coverage throughout country. The electricity was concentrated in the high-level zones of population, which also suffer from poor quality coverage. The level of electrical coverage in 1949 was 14% with a total installed capacity of no more than 30 MW. In these 68 years, the level of coverage has grown to 99.4%, and in the installed capacity is now approaching 3,500 MW. The same constitutive law established as fundamental and necessary to use natural renewable resources, especially hydroelectricity. ICE devoted itself to studying the entire hydroelectric potential in the country, conducting analyses that eventually led to the creation of several stations. In the 1970s, we did an analysis to diversify the counterfoil of production of electricity in which geothermal was analyzed along with wind power, solar energy, and biomass. At ICE, we take charge of the studies though planning, design, and when possible even the construction and operation of electrical generation, as well as through transmission and distribution. The ICE is the sole organization responsible for satisfying the electrical demand of the country. We have been operating the Miravalles geothermal field for many years, and now we are developing the geothermal fields near the Rincón de la Vieja Volcano at Pailas and Borinquen, each of which has a capacity of 55 MW. In 1963, ICE also became a telecommunications company. ICE installed public telephones in each of the settlements of the country's many remote areas, which by providing the possibility of direct communication was an important step in the development of Costa Rica. We now support approximately 60% of the cell phone market.</p><h4>ICE works in many areas including telecoms, infrastructure projects, and the electricity sector. In which area is ICE currently concentrating most?</h4><p>We have a planning outlook of 25 years; electricity demand in recent years has not grown as it had previously. We had growth at one time of around 5.5%; however, because of economic reasons this figure is now closer to 1.2-2%, as the country is still suffering from the effects of the 2008 recession. We are currently in the last phase of the Reventazon hydroelectric plant project, which will add 305 MW of electricity to the country's energy matrix. We inaugurated the plant on September 16, 2016. After that point, we will continue working with geothermal, beginning the construction of Pailas II, and finishing a new 50 MW privately owned hydroelectric plant, as well as pursuing several private developments where ICE buys its energy. There are two wind power plants of 20 MW. Looking ahead, our vision is to begin construction of Diquis hydroelectric plant, which would boast a 650 MW capacity.</p><h4>In recent months, ICE has been undertaking huge investments to expand 3G and 4G coverage in 33 new regions. What have been some of the main highlights of this project?</h4><p>There are two things that are most important for us, namely wireless coverage and internet access. We are in a constant process of optimization and introducing new improvements to our coverage. We have been making advances in fiber optics, and we still have room to expand further in what we call the “last mile," which is the section in which we still have a lot of copper. If we are looking at growing our provision of 3G and 4G services, the best is still yet to come with direct fiber-optic connectivity. In this sense, we can begin the processes of developing applications, as there are intelligent cities, intelligent homes, and a wide availability of services, which many of the developed countries such as such as Korea and China, as well as European nations, have been implementing.</p><h4>Costa Rica will soon achieve its goal of 100% renewably sourced electricity generation, mainly from hydro energy. How did this project come together and how do you foresee Costa Rica achieving this goal?</h4><p>Everything depends on the plan of development that we have in place, which is adequately balanced, and the hydrological and meteorological conditions at play in Costa Rica. A year of constant generation using 100% renewable sources could be achieved; however, the cost would be high. A balance between risk and benefit should reflect a bit of thermal generation, but in the vast majority of countries throughout the world, thermal energy plays a role of low importance. In 2015, thermal generation was 1.06%, while 4% of our energy supply in 2016 will come from thermal generation, due primarily to the dry weather. In the second quarter, we expect to generate 0% thermal generation, which means that a thermal generation of less than 2% is a possible scenario.</p><h4>Costa Rica and the ICE are greatly characterized by environmental responsibility. What are your main initiatives in this regard?</h4><p>We have always been associated with environmental and CSR initiatives. When we develop a project, we also generate employment opportunities for the people of the region; our priority is always the people of the region. We have several key measures in terms of the study of environmental impact. We seek to compensate the communities with social works, such as schools, sidewalks, sport centers, and so on. All of our plants are certified, and we are advancing with ISO 9001, ISO 14001, and ISO 18001. We have contributed in important ways for many years, declaring zones of reservation, as is the case with Reventazon. There is a conservation area in the Arenal Zone in which we have taken an active part, and we have excellent relations with the National Park System. In our geothermal projects, all of the steam and water extracted from the soil is then injected back into it, which guarantees that there are no types of environmental pollution. We have systems that are set out at the start of a plant's operation in which we establish different environmental parameters, and we monitor these throughout plant's operation to detect any changes. This approach has, thus far, been very successful.</p><h4>What are some of the long-term goals for ICE?</h4><p>We are looking to support the counterfoil of renewable energy, moving it closer to 100% and satisfying demand with high-quality supply. We also hope to continue with the programs that we have in the place for growing the market and rightly secure them. In addition to this, our goal is to support the cost of electricity according to the agreements that we establish with the government of the republic, with president, and all citizens. The cost that we ensured in July 2014 will hold for 18 months. After that period had elapsed, we extended for 18 additional months during 2016, and we hope to be able to support it during 2017 as well. This in total would represent the possibility of 42 months in which the cost of the electricity is not going to overcome the limit that we established, but rather it would likely fall. The reduction that we recorded at the end of July was around 14%.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You have argued on the “six secrets of transformational leadership," reflecting on your experience in Malaysia since 2009. Could you elaborate on these, and how would you translate these into practice for the Tanzanian case?</h4><p>First let us agree that it is not my job to translate this into practice in Tanzania. In 2012, I took it upon myself to share the 6 Secrets with President Kikwete, and that gentlemen took ownership of transforming their practices. The Kikwete administration had already decided to play the Game of The Impossible (Secret #1) even before we showed up. Tanzanian Development Vision (TDV) 2025 was created to transform the economy to middle income status by 2025. It is a highly ambitious goal in view of their current milieu. In making the TDV2025 declaration, they also determined their True North (Secret #2), which was GNI, just like Malaysia. Per the WB Atlas method, GNI should exceed USD1,036 per capita to qualify as lower-middle income.<br>The Discipline of Action (Secret #3) was perhaps lacking in the beginning because civil servants were used to long periods of inactivity because of a mix of reasons bureaucratic or resource driven. President Kikwete created the Big Results Now (BRN) system and established the President's Delivery Bureau (PDB) to assist the civil service to generate and maintain momentum by utilizing the convening power of the Presidency to get this moving. In the BRN system, ownership of monitoring and problem solving was assigned to several lead ministers who were held accountable through their public pledges to deliver, and also by the internal governance system. This thereby demonstrated Situational Leadership (Secret #4). Most significantly, and particular in the African context where distrust between the public and private sector is endemic, the Kikwete Administration conducted cabinet workshops that enabled the entire cabinet to jointly identify key focus areas; and following that, they conducted labs to enable the entire stakeholder base (government, private sector, development partners, etc.) to jointly create detailed implementation plans to hit the targets set for the aforementioned focus sectors. This was a great demonstration of the Winning Coalition (Secret #5) coming together to solve a national problem. Secret #6, acknowledging Murphy's Law and preparing oneself to attract divine intervention to enable progress is manifested in the establishment of the implementation framework where progress is constantly monitored so contingency plans can be prepared, external parties, e.g. PEMANDU, development partners, the International Review Panel, are all engaged to provide the “view from the outside" to assist Tanzanian decision making. I would say the Tanzanian administration under President Kikwete had done a good job reflecting the 6 Secrets in how they set their program up. And I fully expect the current President John Magufuli to further put his personal stamp on the system.</p><h4>You have an operation in Tanzania, emulating the work and success of PEMANDU in Malaysia. What are the key common factors and differences between the implementation of a transformation agenda between Tanzania and Malaysia?</h4><p>The TDV2025 program is entirely owned by the Tanzanian government, and we have seconded a team of Malaysians to work with them, at their request, to supplement their human capital base. Perhaps this is the first difference between the Malaysian and Tanzanian situation: we have assembled a team from diverse backgrounds from the private and public sectors, and they have been doing this since the GTP began in 2009. The Tanzanians have not had a chance to build that depth. The other difference between our programs is the area of program funding (and the resultant structures to support it). Tanzania is quite dependent on the largesse of foreign development partners with its overseas development aid (ODA). Its systems and structures are geared very much toward this model; Malaysia is quite free from this constraint. Malaysia managed to mobilize private capital for infrastructure development, and we also have systems in place and extensive/expensive experience here. In Tanzania, the ability and readiness of the public and private sectors to work together in the national interest is not really there in any meaningful fashion. However, there is a growing willingness to embark on PPP initiatives to enable government funds to be freed up for social sectors. Malaysia will also help Tanzania to develop this crucial expertise. With that said, I believe Malaysia and Tanzania have much more in common than we have differences. In my numerous interactions, I found its senior leaders and civil servants to be well educated and credible—they have perhaps lacked the resources to fully demonstrate their abilities. Their top leadership from President Kikwete then, and to President Magufuli now, are highly focused on delivery; and that is a key commonality with Prime Minister Najib.</p><h4>Could you tell us more about your cooperation with the Tanzanian government and the World Bank on your projects here?</h4><p>Since 2012 we have supported the government of Tanzania, using our BFR methodology, to translate its Tanzanian Development Vision 2025 from high level-vision statements into granular, implementable programs. Our cooperation is a government-to-government program initiated by former President Kikwete after he observed Malaysia's National Transformation Program (NTP) in action during his visit to Kuala Lumpur in September 2011. The Malaysian government agreed to provide the human resources over a period of five years to assist in the development of their own systems and human capital. However, the funds to compensate the government of Malaysia for the expenses incurred were provided to the government of Tanzania by the UK's Department for International Development (DFID), USAID, the World Bank, and the Swedish government. PEMANDU does not work directly with any of these agencies. We support the government of Tanzania solely. The interests of these various agencies may be reflected in some aspects of TDV2025, but we view those as Tanzanian priorities, and not of the World Bank or any other development partner. Ownership of programs must also be, and be seen to be, vested in the local government to the civil servants will develop their capabilities as they execute their solutions.</p><h4>In your opinion, what are the key strengths of the Tanzanian economy, and how what needs to be done to unlock the full potential?</h4><p>In my personal opinion, Tanzania's latent wealth may be one of the highest around. It is incredibly rich in mineral resources, including now newly proven natural gas fields. It has not hitherto benefited from domestic value addition of these mineral resources, but that is something that is bound to change. The country is strategically located as a logistics hub because of its many seaports, which are able to serve their landlocked neighbors. Their tourism resources are hugely underexploited due to poor connectivity and lack of proper marketing. Did you know that Mount Kilimanjaro is in Tanzania? Did you know that the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania in many times larger than Kenya's Masai-Mara, but only has a fraction of Kenya's hotel rooms and air connections? Did you know that Tanzania produced a surplus of maize, for example, but hasn't been able to fully monetize it due to the lack of downstream agricultural infrastructure? Tanzania has large swathes of arable land and a large labor force that has not been fully tapped. When concrete and determined actions are taken by the government to address these deficiencies, the economy will take off.</p><h4>How do you envision Tanzanian-Malaysia relations evolving over time? Where do you see room for increased economic activity between the two nations?</h4><p>You will notice that the examples I shared of Tanzania's potential wealth—minerals, agriculture, tourism, and so on—were all the same sectors that provided the initial kick for Malaysia's own economic development. Our stories have the same beginning. It should follow that the next chapters will also be similar if we share our transitional experiences and they pick them up. Therefore, I foresee Malaysia and Tanzania continuing to leverage on each other in a win-win partnership through their journey from a low income, commodities-based economy to a middle-income, manufacturing-based economy. The key to unlocking this potential will be for Tanzania to be able to clearly communicate its focus and priorities to assist the business community to assess risk vs. potential in a transparent manner.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us about the origins of the EEC project?</h4><p>Our eastern seaboard has been a major discussion point for our country since the 1980s, when we discovered natural gas in the Gulf of Thailand. Over the years, Thailand has developed the eastern seaboard quite successfully with the petrochemical, automobile, and electronics industries. Our new government has developed a long-term vision to see how we can export this successful case and integrate new industries in the region because the opening of the AEC means that trade will expand across ASEAN. Thailand is a natural, geographic hub, especially on the mainland surrounding the CLMV countries. The EEC will act as an industrial belt, with access to Myanmar on the west and connecting Thailand to Phnom Penh and then on to the east side of Vietnam, which is a major part of our economic growth strategy. There are many industries already established and we want to introduce extensions, incentives, and value-add services of many types. The government has announced the new S curve of five industries that will look to the future development of our country, and will be central to our work on the EEC. These include robotics, medical, aviation, biofuels, and, crucially, digital.</p><h4>How many of these plans relate to the government's push to upgrade infrastructure and build connectivity within Thailand and the region?</h4><p>The government's infrastructure plans are absolutely crucial to this development, as the EEC's main selling point is indeed its unrivaled access to major airports, sea ports, and trade routes. According to the government's plan, we will now have a high-speed train from Bangkok to Rayong, a key location within the EEC, and currently one of Thailand's main industrial hubs. In Rayong, there is a deep-sea port for heavy industry; however, with the EEC, we will develop another seaport from the navy in Sattahip. We also have U-Tapao airport, which can currently accommodate 800,000 passengers annually. This summer, however, a new terminal will open that will boost its capacity to 3 million and this is just the beginning. It has already assigned a professional consulting firm to design two runways, a new terminal, and maintenance, repair, and overhaul facilities for aircraft. Together with the Sattahip commercial port, this will cater to tourists as well as industry, as it is close to Pattaya and we are developing a ferry service that will allow people to travel across the Gulf of Thailand in one hour instead of five to six hours by road. These developments will enhance the EEC on top of the connectivity. In addition, there will be a motorway extension. We will have a web network within the EEC to increase logistics efficiency and also connect to the outside area. This is a major investment and a major driver behind the EEC project. Specifically, we estimate that the government and private sectors will pump roughly THB1.5 trillion over the next five years into the development.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>This year is fast paced because the government wants the project to be initiated by 2017. We have to engage many ministries so currently we separate the jobs. The first is industry; we have to specify in detail the areas in the industrial zone, including urbanization. The Ministry of Industry and the Industrial Estate will look into the details together with city planners. The second job is on connectivity. In this case, we have the transportation planning agencies, which are under the Ministry of Transportation. We need the private sector in the area to join them. Right now, we are also engaging the tourism sector, as the EEC is focused not only on industry, but tourism as well. All in all, we expect the infrastructure and investments in the area to be completed within five years. However, the EEC is a step-by-step process and with all the sector-wide developments pushing ahead, we expect to see positive results as we go.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess the role of Sharif University in the development of the education system in Iran?</h4><p>Sharif University was founded 50 years ago and has become the leading technical university in Iran and among the best in the Middle East. The latest QS rankings have placed Sharif first in the country for the fourth consecutive year. Sharif graduates have gone on to become outstanding scientists, engineers, and, indeed, leaders worldwide. Our alumni have a presence in over 100 countries worldwide, and Sharif's global character has been shaped through its alumni and body of academic staff, who are pulled from all corners of the globe. We enjoy a unique position in the Iranian higher education system, and that is because our renowned quality of education and research makes us the top destination for undergraduates as well as those who wish to pursue postgraduate study. Of those admitted to Sharif last year, 97 were ranked in the top 100 and 600 were ranked in the top 1,000 in the national university entrance exam of 500,000 participants in physical sciences. Furthermore, Sharif contributes considerably to the country's higher education through its doctoral graduates, who are the prime candidates for faculty positions at top universities across the country. Of the 2,000 PhD graduates, more than 75% are currently faculty members of other universities in Iran.</p><h4>How is Sharif University enhancing its presence in international academia and cooperating with foreign educational and research centers?</h4><p>Internationalization is a high priority on our agenda, and we have thus actively promoted and encouraged international research and educational exchange. For example, Sharif is a member of the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) and has been an active participant in some of the most important experiments, such as the finding of the Higgs' Boson, or God particle. We have a number of joint research projects with L'École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Aalto University, University of Trieste, University of Arizona, UC Davis, and Koç University, to name a few. In addition, Sharif has enjoyed both long-standing joint-degree programs like the one with the University of Grenoble, and short-term demand-driven ones like a joint executive degree program with the University of Calgary, Canada. We have a number of educational and research exchange programs whereby students and faculty members alike gain international experience and carry out research components, spending sabbaticals abroad. As part of this exchange, we also host international students and faculty in our departments and laboratories. In line with the university's internationalization strategy, we have recently allocated a number of scholarships for full-time international students from the Middle East and Central. In the post JCPOA era, Sharif has witnessed a surge of interest from international bodies for setting up collaborations with the university. Academic, and indeed business delegations visiting Iran have made Sharif their first port of call thanks to our body of alumni, who are well-respected academics and industry leaders worldwide.</p><h4>Is 2016 a turning point for Sharif University's history in the education system?</h4><p>The year 2016 is the 50th Anniversary of Sharif University of Technology. The past 50 years have left a deep-rooted legacy in excellence in higher education in our country and the world at large. In order to continue on this path of excellence, we must constantly fine-tune our educational and research programs and retain and hire world-class faculty. In this context, this academic year 2016-2017 we are starting the implementation of the five-year strategic plan. The main objectives of the plan are: promoting interdisciplinary education and research; giving students more choices and say in their curriculum and research activities; enhancing the quality of campus life; contributing to the wealth generation in the country through commercialization of knowledge; helping our staff and students to establish knowledge-based start-up companies; and forming strategic partnerships with top universities and research centers across the world.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does the Ministry of Science and Technology play in promoting innovation and start-ups across Thailand?</h4><p>Thailand has realized it needs to be strategic. We have to provide an ecosystem that is conducive to investment and develop Thailand as the gateway for manufacturing and trading with the region and beyond. Given that we have a number of competitive advantage factors, including our rich agricultural output, substantial human resources—a 70-million strong population—and strategic location, we are well positioned to make use of the growing opportunities in the region. Moving forward, innovation across all industries is vital for our growth, including manufacturing, start-ups, tourism, water management, and so on. In this sense, government policy and instruments are important in leading and facilitating innovation. For example, in the start-up movement, which is still relatively new in Thailand, the government will assist as much as possible this year and in 2017 before the private sector comes in. In April, we held the Start-up Thailand 2016 event, from which we realized we have potential scattered across our economy and the role of the government is to set up an ecosystem to help them launch and grow from an early age. We also work closely with the Ministry of Finance to introduce a number of fresh tax incentives for start-ups, and are in the process of establishing a start-up grant fund to fill in the gaps until the private sector moves in.</p><h4>What are the ministry's goals in terms of national spending on R&amp;D?</h4><p>Our current R&amp;D expenditure for 2015 is 0.48% of GDP; however, in 2016 we would like to almost double this to 0.8%, which is a significant jump. Personally, I will try to push this figure to 1% because statistically, most developed economies go beyond 1%. After 1%, this process becomes much easier and smoother; it has the momentum to also boost a country that borrows or copies others' technology into a country that protects its intellectual property. Having said that, we also recognize that we need to get the private sector to contribute 70% of the 1%; this is our policy, and we put in a great deal of effort to encourage and facilitate our private sector to invest. This can be done through taxation, where we have a scheme in which we provide 300% tax incentive for those companies who invest in research—anything that falls into the category of research, development, or innovation, and across all sectors. In the past, it was only R&amp;D but now we have expanded to include innovation as well. The target for the private sector is 70%, and we work with BOI, whose strategies and privilege offer the largest benefits to companies who do research and innovation.</p><h4>How would you categorize Thailand's international outlook from the ministry's perspective?</h4><p>The outlook is extremely bright. The countries that we met and discussed with did not talk about a trading partnership but about establishing a strategic partnership, which is important to us. We do not just deal with trading; we talk about how we can cooperate in the long run to ensure good mobility between the countries and healthy partnership in sectorial trade and industries. We look to boost our international cooperation, particularly in the fields of transportation infrastructure and digital connectivity as they are in line with the priorities of this government. However, each country has its specific characteristics and strategic interests for us. For example, in Russia, we focus primarily on collaborating on the space program or using nuclear for peace such as for medical and industrial goods. The Chinese, on the other hand, are keen to help us develop our start-ups and open labs, as well as issues such as food security. In every country that we visit, through collaboration in research and innovation, we can help our partner countries to expand to CLMV markets, and given the growth potentials in the region, this presents a huge opportunity to them.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In January 2016, the government increased the Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism's budget in recognition of its importance as a key economic sector in Tanzania. What are your priorities for using these funds?</h4><p>The Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism is responsible for forestry, wildlife, tourism, and national heritage so our investments will clearly go into these areas as a direct or indirect contribution to the economy. In the forestry sector, we will invest more in tree planting in new extension areas, the protection of existing forestry resources for water catchments, and the creation of new nature reserves to ensure total conservation of areas with exceptional flora and fauna. We have eight nature reserves in Tanzania. In the wildlife sector, our main investments will go into anti-poaching efforts. We will also invest in improving infrastructure, especially access into our national parks, because wildlife is our main tourist attraction. We are opening up the western region of the country; where we have chimpanzees in Gombe Stream National Park and in the Mahale Mountains bordering Lake Tanganyika. We also have Katavi National Park, which is a pristine park in western Tanzania. We are also opening up the southern tourism circuit. We are extending the airport in Iringa so that it can take larger aircraft and we are planning to invest in the road between Iringa and the Ruaha National Park. We intend to open up the Udzungwa Mountains National Park where a new primate species to be discovered recently.</p><h4>What is the new administration's position on coordinating with international institutions to help reduce and prevent poaching?</h4><p>Our policy has three levels. The first is coordinating with the international community, because if there is no demand for ivory in the world poaching will cease. We are working with the international community to get everyone on board with the idea that only elephants should wear ivory and that every person wearing a piece of ivory represents the death of an elephant that was killed for that piece of jewelry. At the regional level, we are cooperating with our neighbors that also have elephants and coordinating with them so that we can apprehend poachers together. If poachers flee Tanzania they can be apprehended in Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Zambia, or Mozambique. At the domestic level we are making a lot of changes. Firstly, we need modernize our techniques for detecting poachers. We have a monitoring system in place now so that we can respond to instances of poaching immediately. Secondly, we are arresting not only the people who shoot the elephants, but also the ones who cut off the tusks, transport the ivory, sell to the middlemen in the big cities, and those who export it to countries like Vietnam. We cannot do this alone; therefore, the new government has formed an inter-agency taskforce to deal with poaching, terrorism, drugs, money laundering, and other vices. This taskforce works with the Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism to deal with poaching. With this change in our approach we have apprehended and jailed most of the big players who were running this business. We have recently apprehended poachers from Guinea, Ghana, Kenya, and Uganda who were working in Tanzania. </p><h4>What is your opinion on applying VAT to tourism services in Tanzania, particularly as Kenya, your main tourism competitor, has removed it due to the negative impact it had on the industry?</h4><p>In 2007, Tanzania pushed strongly to develop the tourism industry and we enacted our Tourism Act in 2009. One of the first actions we took under that legislation was to allow tourism services companies to operate in a tax-free environment to help them grow. We envisaged that they would need this assistance for around five to six years. In 2015, we realized that the time had come for the tourism sector to pay its share of tax like all other sectors. By that time, tourism had grown to 17% of GDP and Tanzania was earning 25% of its foreign currency from tourism. We cannot have a small farmer paying taxes and huge business with a turnover of millions not paying their share. The second point is that Tanzania is moving away from its dependency on donor support and we have to be able to stand on our own feet. The country's dependency on donor support is around 18% now, down from about 54% when I was first a minister in 2006. We will not be able to stand on our own feet if a significant part of the economy does not pay tax. Moreover, foreign donor country support is provided through taxpayers money in those countries and we cannot expect their tax dollars to support foreigners who are not even paying their own taxes. This is part of the rationale for our decision. The scenario in Kenya is different. In 2012, the number of tourists visiting Kenya was about 2 million, but it fell to 1.3 million in 2015. On the other hand, Tanzania is probably the most peaceful place in Africa, so you cannot compare the two countries' strategies. Kenya is our good friend and neighbor, but it has its own policies.</p><h4>How do you see tourism flows evolving in Tanzania?</h4><p>The biggest shift will be to diversify our tourism product from Serengeti National Park, Ngorongoro, and trekking Kilimanjaro to include going to the beach afterwards. We have the best beaches on the East African coast; for example, on Pemba Island. We are talking to investors to create land for tourism near Dar es Salaam and another project to build a big marina in the South of Kilwa. One of the biggest problems we have had so far in trying to grow tourism in the west and south of the country is that people usually have to travel to these areas by small 12 to 15-seater aircraft and the airfares are high. However, from October 2016 with the arrival of new aircrafts of Air Tanzania you will be able to travel on regular flights to Kigoma, where there is a chimpanzee park at Gombe, which is pristine. Then, on to Dar es Salaam for USD150 instead of having to pay USD1,600 for chartered flights. We are also planning to improve the airport in Iringa to establish a tourism base for this region. The new aircraft being acquired will help us to do this.</p><h4>How are you responding to the threat of the climate change to make the tourism sector sustainable in the long term?</h4><p>There have been a lot of changes and when you base your economy on nature and the ecosystem you have to take this into account seriously. In the past, we used to think about wildlife and national parks as ecosystems we should leave to take their own course. Now you cannot, you have to respond to the new challenges. You have to be very dynamic and study and measure things very accurately, you cannot just sit back and push paper. You will lose all the wildlife within 20 to 30 years if you take a laissez-faire approach. Therefore, we are doing quite a bit of modification to the basic conservation principles because we have to respond to the monster that is climate change.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your vision for annual economic growth during the next five-year plan and how were the target sectors of this plan identified?</h4><p>We aim to maintain a 2.5-3.5% GDP growth rate across the different sectors. However, the diminishing returns from the oil sector will definitely have an impact, and that has to be offset by two things: producing more oil and more gas so we can generate more revenue, and by having other, non-oil sectors grow. In this five-year plan, we have concentrated on five non-oil sectors: manufacturing and industry, minerals, tourism, logistics, and fisheries. For example, with manufacturing, we are expanding our industrial zones. We are expanding Samail, Sohar, Nizwa, and Sur, and we are servicing more land. There are tenders to expand Samail and Sohar already, and we are also expanding a new industrial zone. In the minerals sector, most of the work is focused on changing the law.</p><h4>What role would you like to see public-private partnerships play in enhancing private-sector development in Oman?</h4><p>Outside of the five sectors mentioned, there will be PPPs or BOOT projects in a few sectors, especially the health sector. We will start to see projects that are designed, financed, and built by companies either on long-term lease terms to the government or through a process of transferring to the government over time. We are also working on refining the law pertaining to sewage, and there will be privately-owned sewage plants just like privately-owned power plants, but the networks will still be government owned. We have already started testing this transfer through Bee'ah, which is a state-owned company that has agreements with private companies and is transferring the work of waste collection to privately-owned companies. This is regulated by a new law that will allow for a larger private sector role and competition in the waste management sector. </p><h4>What drivers were behind more than 10% increase in FDI inflows, and how does Oman assert itself in the international arena as a destination for foreign investment?</h4><p>We have been generally shy about borrowing and, over the years, we have not gone out aggressively looking to borrow or for direct investment. Now we have more of a need to excite foreign investors and encourage lending. Foreign capital comes outside of borrowing too. The Gulf is seeing a good FDO inflow in real estate from Europe, while, from India, we are seeing construction and mechanical engineering. The Chinese have tapped into a new market totally, which are in clusters like Duqm. In addition, since 1970, the government was the only entity that did industrial parks. In 2016, we saw a local Omani company take a 250sqm piece of land and create an industrial zone, which was the Sindan project in South Batinah, and then after that there was a big USD10 billion investment by the Chinese in Duqm for an industrial park. </p><h4>To what extent is Oman looking into expanding its footprint abroad?</h4><p>In 2016, we have so far been in Africa three times in different capacities. We participated in a meeting in Kenya, then we took about 200 people from around 100 businesses to Ethiopia. Now we are exporting many commodities like packed food and oils and we are also sending petrochemicals to Ethiopia. We then went to Tanzania with a delegation of about 80 businesspeople. We feel Africa will grow tremendously and we feel that we could be a major supplier of petrochemicals and packed food to them. We could also supply fiber optics, cables, and specialized building materials, as well as soft services like IT and advertisement, including website design, development, and content management. As Oman Air opens up new destinations both in Africa and Iran, we will see more direct interaction. There have been numerous trade missions in 2016. They are not just to expand our exports, but to directly deal with the people of those countries so we can import, export, and re-export to them.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How successful have Mexico's recent structural reforms been in stimulating economic growth?</h4><p>The structural reforms have been far reaching, not just in energy and telecoms but also in labor and education as well as anti-trust laws and reforms, which is more within the mandate of Banxico. All reforms have led to positive results, although it might not be that obvious in all cases, especially considering the effect of adverse external scenarios and factors. The economic growth that was expected and hoped for has not necessarily materialized to the extent we hoped. But of course, it is hard to estimate and measure what the effects would have been without those reforms. The reforms have been productive and positive. The other side of the coin in terms of increased production is lower prices, and we have seen some substantial decrease in prices, at least in telecoms, electricity, and gasoline. Important progress has been made in that sense.</p><h4>Should investors be worried about the recent decline in the value of the peso?</h4><p>The behavior of the peso is a result of Mexico having a flexible exchange rate system in which the peso can adjust to how the international environment performs. At the same time you want strong fundamentals to also serve as an anchor. When you anchor a ship, it can still move, without drifting aimlessly. That is a good way to look at the peso now. Unfortunately we are facing an adverse international scenario. In 2015, we saw low growth globally, with low commodity prices and incomplete recovery in the US economy, along with additional measures by the Fed in the way of normalizing its unconventional monetary policy. Add to that various other geopolitical issues like Brexit and the US presidential election, and those issues create jitters in markets, which affect the exchange rate. To a large extent, however, there is confidence in the strength of the macro framework in Mexico. We recently received an important vote of confidence from the IMF that granted an extension in flexible credit lines. The IMF has a flexible credit line with which it helps countries prevent a crisis rather than resolving one. It basically extends the credit line for well-performing countries. This shows the country is evaluated highly and that it supports our policy framework. It also means the IMF puts money behind its words, in this case to the tune of $88 billion, which is a substantial amount. That is an important vote of confidence. As time passes and as some of these unknowns are clarified with progress in terms of implementing structural reforms, and as the US grows more robustly, this will play in Mexico's favor.</p><h4>Why is the Sistema de Pagos Interbancarios en Dólares (SPID) being implemented and how is it beneficial for the economy?</h4><p>In Mexico in different sectors we have important production chains that have developed, and often they have to make payments among themselves in dollars. We know these transactions take place, and often these payments take a long time, sometimes days or even weeks. Sometimes they are also subjected to issues relating to the regulatory environment in the US. Mexico has one of the best large- and small-scale payment systems in pesos, which is an important platform. You can make retail payments from one account to another account in a matter of seconds. That was facilitated by the fact that participating banks have accounts in Mexico and the Central Bank can give intraday credit and so on. Now, we cannot give intraday credit in dollars, because we are not the issuer of dollars, but we can complete the transaction in minutes in some cases, or in a few hours at the latest, but certainly during the day. That diminishes the transaction costs of many businesses in Mexico and this is something built on existing infrastructure. We basically adjusted the peso system for dollar transactions, with the obvious limitation that we are not the issuer of the currency. There are strict regulations concerning who can open a dollar account; individuals cannot open a dollar account, for example. The only thing we promote is the ability to make payments in a more efficient way between dollar accounts that already exist.</p>]]></richbody0content>

In Salalah, we have business involved in the mining and exporting of gypsum, ready-mix, meaning the production of concrete products and paving blocks, and the sale of aggregates and sand to third parties. Supporting these two business and our Muscat operations is our logistics business, which undertakes all transportation and logistics internally and for third parties. Our business is roughly 75% export orientated and 25% local. In addition, we have two associates (investments). The first is Majan, which produces and exports around 4 million tons of limestone per annum, which also supplies our investment in Carmeuse Majan with raw material, which is then converted into lime for the export market. We export roughly 45-50% of all exports from the Port of Salalah.</p><h4>What are the holding's production capabilities?</h4><p>For marble, we produce and sell about 42,000sqm of polished and cut product per month. We do about 1.2 million tons of aggregates and sand on an annual basis. In the ready-mix business, we produce roughly 250,000 cubic meters of concrete on an annual basis plus blocks, curbstones, and aggregate and sand. We produce about 2.4 million tons and 4.2 million tons of gypsum and limestone, respectively, on an annual basis. At Carmeuse Majan we have one kiln commissioned producing about 150,000 tons of lime per year.</p><h4>How has your transport network expanded beyond serving your own subsidiaries?</h4><p>We have taken the next step in this regard and brought on a logistics graduate to turn our captive transport business into a logistics and warehousing hub business. We now provide transport to all of our subsidiaries and for our clients between Salalah and Muscat in both directions. We are considering a warehousing facility in Muscat to centralize our activity. We are looking at this on a regional basis, but our initial focus is on Oman. In terms of export markets, a big market for us is India. It is close and has huge urbanization and infrastructure projects, which provide good demand for our gypsum and limestone. We also export to Vietnam, Thailand, Australia, and the east coast of Africa, including Mozambique, South Africa, and Tanzania.</p><h4>Do you see room for growth in the mining sector, and what measures do regulators need to adopt to increase overall production and competitiveness?</h4><p>I divide the Omani market into two mining sectors: bulks and metals. It is all about economies of scale and, when the two are divided into different projects, the latter comprises a relatively small percentage. This means in metal projects when building a mining operation, it is going to be based on a number of smaller satellite mining operations that focus on a centralized processing facility. That brings a lot of risks in itself and I am not that positive on the outlook for the metals with scrap constituting a significant proportion of annual supply and demand fundamentals. For example, steel scrap comprises about 50%, copper is about 45%, and PGMs are about 40%. I do not see massive price movements in these commodities with global GDP growth at current levels and most economies are out of synchronization. Cumulative global growth needs to be above 4% to stimulated additional demand to strength metal prices from current levels. As for the steel industry, it is associated with urbanization and infrastructure projects. It's our opinion that Oman should focus on the bulks, like gypsum and limestone. These are world-class assets in Oman and the government needs to get aggressively behind this to make it easier for the big players to do their job, to grow, and to create new markets. That also means more infrastructure from an export capacity perspective because constrained logistics will erode the premium benefits from the quality of the assets. Consolidation to get economies of scale should be the main driver in Oman and support for the big players who have the technical expertise, financial capacity, and the existing operations to expand.</p><h4>What are some principal impediments to growth in the mining sector in terms of attracting investment or bureaucratic issues?</h4><p>The government has been historically slow in granting licenses and fixing certain problems; however, a new CEO has been appointed to run the Public Authority of Mining and he is in the process of addressing all of these historical issues. Current and future mining operations and potential investors require certainty in sustaining and developing new and existing mining operations. It should be noted that investors look at the global opportunities and are not just looking at Oman. Ease of access, legal tenure, and stable investment environments with low risk (relative to the mining sector) will be their focus and will attract investment. Any volatility in these key areas will see investors looking at alternative investment opportunities.</p><h4>Kunooz Holding plans to hold an IPO in the near future. What is the current strategy behind your IPO?</h4><p>The government has encouraged family businesses to hold IPOs in Oman. The market is relatively small and this gives the public the opportunity to invest in high growth areas. It is a distribution of the mineral wealth into the local economy. We need to continue to expand our assets and take advantage of the expansions and contractions in the markets of India on an annual basis. We are currently in discussions with a sovereign wealth fund to take a portion of our equity pre-IPO. The IPO date is going to be dependent on the market and perception of the market in the next couple of years. I think we will have the IPO at some point in 2017.</p><h4>What is your vision for the next 12 months for Kunooz Holding?</h4><p>We are still in the process of converting a family business into a professional organization, so for us the focus will be internally on setting goals and achieving our budgets. We will be focusing on our markets and our customers, creating better long term relationships, and we are working making our assets sweat. Attracting talent into our businesses to make us globally competitive. Our aspirations are not just local, global.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The main goal of the NTDC is to create a world-class tourism sector in Nigeria. What is the strategy for realizing that goal?</h4><p>This is the perfect time for tourism in Nigeria, because corporate governance is at an all-time high, with trust and confidence instilled in Nigerians and foreigners, thanks to President Buhari and his government. When you reduce corruption, there is a cumulative reductive impact on criminality. We are very pleased with this war against corruption, which gives credibility to our national narrative that is both compelling and rich in its cultural diversity and the nation building efforts of the new government. The old image of a corrupt Nigeria is now happily a thing of the past. This is also reflected in domestic tourism as well as foreign tourism investments, because investor confidence is enhanced. Furthermore, having been democratically elected, our President's stance against corruption and his personal integrity have given a boost to the nation's economy, investor confidence, and tourism awareness that would not have been achieved otherwise within a year. This is the fourth consecutively democratically elected government we have had in Nigeria. This is critical, as it sends a powerful signal of stability to foreign investors and bodes well for the tourism sector. Our banking industry is progressive and dynamic; services are improving all the time. They have liquidity, a good capital base, and are stable. We are one of the largest and fastest growing economies in Africa, and we are also the most populous country in Africa. One in every seven black people in the world is a Nigerian. Our population is our greatest asset. Therefore, we have many good things going for us. Nigeria has a very young population, which constitutes about 65%, therefore our future couldn't possibly be anything but bright. Tourism is a private-sector activity, and one of the most important aspects of our strategy is to partner with the private sector. We have to work together to develop the tourism value chain, which affects and touches every sector in the country. Tourism involves everything from power to transport, manufacturing, agriculture, retail, and SME growth. We want to develop the tourism sector through PPP and turn tourism into an asset. We should see tourism sites as real estate investments. Opportunities for investment in tourism exist all around the country. For example, Mambilla Plateau in Taraba State is breathtakingly picturesque; it only needs investments in terms of infrastructural support like road access and hotels.</p><h4>What incentives do you offer foreign investors looking to invest in the Nigerian tourism sector?</h4><p>We offer many incentives such as a 120% tax holiday for the first five years for investors who want to come into the country and for the next five years there is a 50% discount. We will also offer repatriation solutions, and President Buhari is focused on resolving the issue of repatriation of investment proceeds for foreign investors as well as diversifying the economy. We expect the Central Bank will stabilize the situation and solve this glitch. Foreigners no longer require an expatriate quota to work; we will have expatriate work permits, which will make it easier for foreigners to come and work here. What is really in play here is an ongoing process of liberalization and enhancement of the tourism sector for Nigerian investors and foreigners alike.</p><h4>How much does tourism contribute to the Nigerian economy and how do you think it will evolve?</h4><p>Globally, tourism contributes 10% to GDP. In Gambia, tourism contributes as high as 17.7%, Kenya 11%, South Africa 9.8%, Mexico 14.8%, and Cuba recently shot up to 11.2% in anticipation of the embargo lift. In Nigeria, the sector's contribution is just below 5%; however, the Buhari government is determined, with its multifaceted push for corporate governance and the fight against corruption, to create an enhanced and enabling environment for businesses to thrive. In this light, we expect to attract long-term investments and to push the levels of tourism to contribute more and more to the economy. We have a population of 180 million; if just 20 million people spent a per capita income of USD2,000 on domestic travelling and tourism in Nigeria, we would have a tourism market worth USD4 billion. We want to work closely with the private sector and do PPP projects. We also want to work very closely with our state governments and all the traditional rulers, Emirs in the North, the Obas in the West, and the Obis in the East, who are the custodians of cultural heritage. All of our local communities are tourism stakeholders and, working together, we can develop our rich tourism potential, generate employment, reduce crime, reduce internal migration to cities, and create greater integration throughout the country, as well as the cultural benefits; tourism isn't just about leisure. It is crucial for the economy and boosting the standard of living across Nigeria.</p><h4>What are the biggest tourism success stories in Nigeria?</h4><p>Nollywood is one of our biggest success stories. Our musicians are internationally renowned. Religious tourism is developed as well. The cultural tourism sector is huge and medical tourism is growing fast, too. In the North, we have Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital for medical tourism. In Lagos State, we have Reddington Hospital with which we have an MoU for medical tourism, while in Ondo State we have the state-of-the-art Gani Fawehinmi Diagnostic and a Trauma Center and a few others in Lagos. In the East we have a highly professional hospital in Enugu called Memphys Medical. We have two world heritage sites in Adamawa State, including the Sukur UNESCO stone compilation in the North, and in the South we have the Osun Osogbo Groove. Business tourism and the business sector in general is also highly developed in Nigeria, with some of the world's largest companies and brands having offices here, including the world's biggest banks, which have been here for decades. Property investment is also excellent right now in Nigeria. We are also English speakers here, and Commonwealth members. So Nigeria has a lot going for it, in addition to its huge tourism potential.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has your business advanced since you localized your operations here?</h4><p>We started our business in Malaysia in 2012, and before that we managed our projects here from Singapore. To date, we have invested more than MYR150 million, mainly in our stock and equipment. The construction sector, both in the public and private domain, is growing rapidly, and we believe that this momentum will continue. We have been growing on a compound annual rate of about 30% since our establishment, and anticipate this figure for the next few years. Looking at the healthy growth rate of the Malaysian construction industry, there are plenty of rooms to grow for the next decade. Business has grown significantly since our establishment, and we seek new premises for our headquarters and warehousing. The government-backed first metro line, MRT 1, is currently under construction, and the second and third line will follow. The MRT projects are among our main reasons to establish ourselves in Malaysia. The strong and clear outline of the government to develop the country, such as the Economic Transformation Program (ETP) is also the positive indicator for us. Doka is an Austrian company, and the embassy has been instrumental in providing support to open our office here.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about your involvement with landscape defining high-rise construction projects in Malaysia?</h4><p>At this moment, about 60% of our projects are on buildings, which include high rises and 40% are in civil engineering. The latter contain projects like dams, bridges, metro lines, and elevated platforms for public transport, which are generally developed with the government. We are one of the leaders in supplying formwork and safety system for high-rise constructions in the market because of our vast experiences, advanced technology, and construction management support. To date, we have been involved in more than 50 high rise constructions in the country, with notable examples as are PETRONAS Tower 3 (267m), the W Hotel (235m), the ILHAM Tower (274m), the Platinum Park — NAZA Tower (216m), and the recently constructed St. Regis Hotel (205m). Our latest and most prestigious project is Merdeka PNB118, the new signature tower in Kuala Lumpur. It will be approximately 630 m high, thus becoming the tallest tower in Southeast Asia and among the top five tallest towers in the world. On top of that, we have secured also the second highest tower in the country, the TRX Signature Tower. With these two projects, we are proving ourselves to be the specialists in providing innovative formwork system solutions for complex high-rises.</p><h4>What are your defining strengths why  the consortium of Samsung and UEM decided to contract Doka for the Merdeka PNB118  project? </h4><p>We were involved in the tender process from the beginning and were the first to submit our proposals. We showed our commitment to constructing it faster, with highest safety standard and quality. Contractors are practical and pragmatic in the way they look at a proposal and the value they will receive. Our bidding was the highest, but we were chosen nonetheless for our know-how and innovation solutions. Out of the top 10 tallest buildings in the world, six have been constructed with Doka system formwork. The Burj Khalifa (830m) in Dubai is one of our landmark projects, which was delivered on time and with great accuracy. For the Merdeka PNB11 project, we have brought in our latest innovation, Doka Intelligent Formwork using Doka Concremote.. This technology can measure concrete strength development and transmit this data to the relevant stakeholders, like consultant engineers., project managers, and the site supervisor. This ensures the high quality construction of the construction structure, and thus enhancing the lifespan of the asset. As a latecomer to the Malaysian market, we perceived two strategies to penetrate the market; either competing on pricing or to deliver the best quality. We chose to implement the second strategy and we surprised people how well our modern technology works. Soon, developers and contractors realized that it is instrumental to use and invest in advance technology in all stages of the construction process to build state of art architecture of high-rise buildings. Often, we understand better than contractors how the building will look like and what the challenges will be. This is underlying our business principle as “the formwork experts."</p><h4>How would you assess the regulatory framework for contractors and developers?</h4><p>Safety is always a challenge in countries such as Malaysia, where there is plenty of cheap foreign labor employed. They might not understand the safety training and a great deal of companies need to bring it up to the required standards. The authorities are enforcing stricter regulations, which is a good sign. Enforcement remains another challenge, but we see things getting better, stronger, and faster. With regard to safety, there is also an increasingly vocal society. Nowadays, access to information is broader, and accidents are reported quicker. This has led to pressure on the government to increase safety standards. Singapore has strong enforcement of its regulation because of the strong enforcement and high penalties. It makes companies invest more on safety; it is better to spend on safety and have a safe project than to save your money there and then get fined. Doka is renowned for its high standards and according to studies; every EUR1 million invested on safety will result of average EUR2.2 return-on prevention.</p><h4>What are your ambitions for the years ahead? </h4><p>The last four years have been good for our company and we have a strong financial position. Looking forward, we want to further extend our influence on the market with our technology, know-how and setting new quality standards. We believe this is good for all stakeholders involved; developers, contractors, suppliers, and the society at large. With our technology, the construction industry can work faster, safer, and with higher quality.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Lebanese parliament recently approved financial legislation in compliance with global financial standards. How will these laws enhance the regulatory framework for the banking sector?</h4><p>Before the approval of the recent international financial compliance laws, Lebanon was facing the danger of significant sanctions and being blacklisted, which threatened to paralyze the banking sector. These financial compliance laws covering trans-border cash movements, cooperation to fight tax evasion, and measures intended to cut off resources used for terrorism, proved Lebanon's commitment to standards set by the international financial system. The banking sector is considered a pillar of Lebanon's economy and, thus, compliance is a major issue and its implementation is essential to the survival of the sector. By complying with these extraterritorial regulations, Lebanese banks are protecting the country's interests, and securing the continuous work of local financial institutions with the global financial system. Still, it is important to stress that abiding by these laws does not eliminate banking secrecy, it just increases the exceptions as these laws partially lift the secrecy and allow authority to get information about account holders suspected of money laundering or terrorism.</p><h4>How would you assess the regulatory framework for the potential oil and gas sector, and what incentives is the country offering for future tenders?</h4><p>With the anticipation of oil and gas exploration, the Lebanese parliament enacted new oil and gas laws to establish an effective regulatory framework that includes various regulatory bodies. The Law on Petroleum Resources at Sea (Law No. 132/2010) presented many advantages to potential foreign and local entities wishing to participate in the exploration and the production of oil and gas. This law enacts the government to grant local entities a 10-year exploration period, in addition to a 30-year production period during which the government is granted an amount equal to 4% of the gas produced and 5-12% of the oil produced. In addition, the government and the exploring entity divide the revenues per their agreement. The conditions set by this regulatory framework are quite encouraging for any potential participants and will certainly have a positive impact in the future development of the sector. Furthermore, the Lebanese government is relying on arbitration clauses, that ensure foreign entities a fair trial should a conflict arise. On the other hand, the Law on Petroleum Resources at Sea has faced many obstacles in the implementation phase. The first problem was the inexistence of a defined exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in Lebanon, which after its settlement accrued many problems with neighboring countries due to borders delimitation. Another issue has been raised by the division of the areas containing oil and gas into blocs, the purpose of which was to decide the number of blocs to be explored in the first phase, but governmental approval has not been put in place yet. And so, even though the process of oil and gas exploration and production in Lebanon was expected to be implemented in a shorter period, the process has been long delayed and still has yet to see the light.</p><h4>Which economic sectors hold the biggest potential for growth in the upcoming years?</h4><p>The IT, oil, and pharmaceutical sectors are showing promising growth. Startups within the IT sector are becoming increasingly popular, with more than a dozen startups assisted to get their platforms running during 2016 alone. The recent discovery of oil in Lebanon, the existence of new technologies to foster the sector, and the new legislation implemented look to promote fair dealing between businesses that want to exploit Lebanese petroleum resources, so this sector looks promising too. Also, in recent years there has been increasing regional demand for pharmaceuticals. Exports to Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Iraq have all increased, likely due to rapid population growth in those countries and high levels of chronic illnesses. Lebanon has made the most of this situation by serving as a platform for distribution of pharmaceuticals, even reaching markets such as France. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did Hilton Hotels start operations in Lebanon and how has the company expanded over time?</h4><p>Hilton Worldwide is one of the most recognizable hotel chains in the world comprising more than 4,660 managed, franchised, owned, and leased hotels and timeshare properties with nearly 765,000 rooms in 102 countries and territories. We have long been present in the region and opened our fist hotel in Lebanon in 2012, the Al Habtoor Grand in Beirut.</p><h4>What factors make Lebanon an attractive destination for tourism?</h4><p>Lebanon has a great deal to offer visitors including history and culture: the food, the nightlife, the beaches, the attractions, the rich history and historical sites, the mild climate, and many other factors. These have made Lebanon one of the most visited countries for tourism in the Middle East. Beirut has plenty to offer in terms of variety of dining places, entertainment, mountains, coastal sceneries, and cultural events. Beirut has always been a city that generated an artistic flair, and the city always features artistic activities. Lebanon is also a hub for major events and conferences. The biggest bulk of business comes from the pharmaceutical companies, many of which are based in Lebanon and host several conferences throughout the year. In addition, Lebanon has long had a tradition as being known as a medical tourism destination due to the good quality and competitive prices of its medical services. </p><h4>What is the potential for Lebanon to become a hub for business tourism, and how can Hilton contribute to that?</h4><p>The business segment represents a significant share of the total tourism industry in Lebanon and companies continue to send their employees to work in Lebanon. Multinationals have kept their presence in the market. Hilton is a hotel engine of 4,600 hotels around the globe, and we operate many services in the Lebanese market that influence large companies to come and stay with us, for example, we have the largest conference room in Lebanon with a capacity of 2,000 people. Our presence here is key to drive businesses that are associated with Hilton or using Hilton all over the world. </p><h4>In light of the recent fall in occupancy rates, what has been Hilton's strategy to counter this problem?</h4><p>Hilton pays rigorous attention to managing its business channels; our HHonors loyalty program has more than 50 million members and contributes to maintaining our numbers and guests in the country. Also, the Hilton name is well established and carries a great deal of brand loyalty and trust. Our strategy is based on capturing the maximum number of corporate travelers and pushing for MICE tourists to keep coming into the country.</p><h4>What are some aspects of your current renovation plan?</h4><p>We always strive to provide our guests with the ultimate comfort and exceptional travel experiences, whether they visit us for business or for leisure. The overall plan includes the complete renovation of both Hilton Beirut Habtoor Grand and Hilton Beirut Metropolitan Palace; we have started with the refurbishment of public facilities, such as the ballrooms and the lobbies. The rest of the renovation plan will be thoroughly executed throughout the coming years, while maintaining utmost guest satisfaction and service.  </p><h4>What would you like Hilton to achieve under your lead in the following two years?</h4><p>We are geared to continue being the number one hotel in Lebanon. All of our plans and focus is leading toward that ultimate goal, and today we have probably the best position in the local market. If you look at travel advisory websites, we are ahead of our competition and we plan to keep it that way. Our key elements here are team members, quality service, and making people feel at home. Hilton has sought to maintain the quality services people identify us with, and we want to continue growing and improving our services and upgrading our hotels in order to meet the expectations of our clients. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the major contributions of the university to the country?</h4><p>The Lebanese University is the only public university in Lebanon, the largest in terms of student population, and has graduated the highest number of professionals in the country. We have more than 230,000 graduates who have built the foundations of this country and include those who innovate and create in Lebanon: the leaders of this nation. We also have fundamental specialization recognized by the law and by the Ministry of Higher Education; most of our specializations are also taken to other universities in order to grant them with official acknowledgment of their programs. Our degrees and certificates set the tone for local education and we take great pride in that. The university is the clearest reflection of Lebanese society, with students coming from all and every socioeconomic background, religion, town and community across the country. We are an Arabic- and French-speaking university, which adds up to wider diversification, since our students are exposed to two different visions of the world. However, in the past 20 years, the university has become increasingly oriented toward English-taught courses to expose our students to the global business language and contribute to their professional development. All these variables combine to make the university a leading educational center in a multifaceted country.</p><h4>Being the only public higher education institution in Lebanon, how do you maintain a leading position among universities?</h4><p>The strength is in the numbers. Currently, we have more than 72,000 students, who constitute 40% of the overall higher education student population in the country. We count 5,000 instructors and teachers and 49 branches throughout Lebanon. We also have mechanisms that guarantee a brain gain for Lebanese University, such as contracts with students who were granted scholarships that stipulate them to return and contribute their knowledge to the development of the university and the country. We also partner with Lebanese embassies across the world to reconnect the diaspora alumni with their alma mater.</p><h4>What challenges do you face in maintaining your leadership?</h4><p>The main challenge comes from our budget capacities. Being a public institution, we are subjected to budget allocations from the state and this limits our investment capacities. We have several projects in the faculties of medicine and engineering that need loose funding, which we cannot always guarantee; therefore, our students offer their know-how in a social service scheme to the private sector. We also encourage research and need funding for that, so we try to fill those gaps by getting funds from private institutions. We have 600 leading researchers, most of them funded by the Lebanese University, but they also require additional funding from third-party guarantors.</p><h4>Which countries do you have relationships with and what do these international links represent?</h4><p>Our main partnerships are with France, although we also have agreements with Russia, China, Iran, and North and South America. We are constantly expanding our partner relations from East to West to offer our students more options to study abroad. We have signed a fair amount of MoUs with different universities across the globe to send Lebanese University students there and to house foreign students in our university. Last year, we sent 120 top students to different universities in order to pursue their PhDs in different specializations.</p><h4>The Lebanese University celebrated its 65th anniversary this year. What did this event represent?</h4><p>We celebrated it on April 17, and it implied the diffusion of what the future will look like for Lebanese University from now on. We reinforced our commitment to protecting Lebanese society by constituting a security net on the pedagogical teaching sector, whereby we will continue to provide the country with leading lecturers, teachers, and instructors. Our diplomas have a high value in the Middle East, and many of our teachers go to other countries to teach and do residencies there. We have embraced the responsibility to teach for all of Lebanon and we will continue in that direction. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the new projects being carried out at both of your campuses?</h4><p>Providing our students with an environment that stimulates ideas and innovation is important to us, and in line with our current strategic plan. As a result, we are completing a major facility for engineering labs and have started construction on a new library at our Byblos campus with a USD25 million investment. We recently acquired the surrounding land to our Byblos campus with an investment of USD50 million, raising the total size to 300,000sqm. At our Beirut campus, we plan to refurbish our Gezairi Building to house the headquarters of the School of Architecture and Design and also plan to build a new facility for our School of Arts and Sciences. </p><h4>How is LAU applying technology and innovation to its programs?</h4><p>Embracing technology to improve education and innovation are our core values. In this spirit, LAU was the first university in Lebanon to be wireless, and we have made all our classrooms smart. Now, our staff and students can access the internet at any time, using any Wi-Fi enabled device. We understand that it is no longer possible to have a proper education without technology; therefore, we try to keep up to date in every possible way. Plus, we provide training to our faculty and staff to make sure they know how to use the technology.</p><h4>Lebanon is facing a brain drain problem. How is this affecting the country?</h4><p>Moving abroad has been part of the Lebanese psyche for a long time. Many of our graduates have left the country and succeeded abroad in a varied number of areas. That said, it is important for our leaders to create more and better jobs for our graduates so that they can continue to contribute to the transformation of the nation. Lebanese people abroad have created an idea of a nation that somehow does not really exist, and yet that keeps them connected to their motherland. We need to build a better society so Lebanese people here or elsewhere identify with it. Between USD7-8 billion enters Lebanon every year in the form of remittances from places as varied as the US, Canada, the Gulf, and Latin America. Lebanese expatriates represent the country in their respective destinations and that alone is a great contribution.</p><h4>Can you talk about your international links and exchange programs?</h4><p>International links are one of our most important assets. As an American university with a New York charter and headquarters there, we are truly international, with faculty, staff, and students from all over the world. We understand the value and importance of international connections. As such, we link our institution in order to provide opportunities for our faculty and our students to go abroad. The idea is simple: we have no other choice but to establish linkages with other institutions to give our students the opportunity to have a foreign experience, or we will relinquish and our students will carry the burden.</p><h4>What are your plans for 2016?</h4><p>Our goal for the year is to ensure our plans are executed in order to maintain our excellence and continue to be the leading university in Lebanon. We have a capital pool of USD333 million that we need to allocate in the following five years. We have a committee composed of five panels looking at a new strategic plan. The first panel assessed our intellectual capital and how we can use it to continue to improve the university. The second panel was about pedagogy and how teaching has changed dramatically and how we can embrace these changes. The third panel was on tuition and the sources of revenue the university can use in order to alleviate the pressure of tuition. The fourth panel focused on innovation, which is crucial for our students to continue growing intellectually. The final panel explored shared governance and how the different components of the university can participate in the decision making process. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>2016 marks AUB's 150th anniversary. How has the university's strategy changed over time, and what are your new endeavors for the years to come?</h4><p>We try to improve at all levels and want to improve our services to students and build new infrastructure. The university has grown and we are preparing a new strategic plan as well as a campus master plan that will be implemented over the coming years. The most important goal in the strategic plan is to move AUB from being a teaching-centered research institution toward being a premier research institution in the region. AUB has reinstated tenure this year by a decision of the Board of Trustees. When tenure is implemented, hopefully in a year or so, the university will be able to attract and retain qualified faculty who are excellent researchers and at the same time great educators. In the last 15 years, AUB has grown considerably, from about 5,000 students to more than 8,600 students, including graduate and undergraduate students. Because of this, we need more space on campus to accommodate students, faculty, and staff. </p><h4>With the current boom in the knowledge-based economy, how does AUB prepare its students to embrace entrepreneurial activities?</h4><p>We graduate around 1,500 undergraduate and 500 graduate students annually who go out to work in around 100 countries around the world. Most of them open their own businesses and go out on their own; they become CEOs, managers, and entrepreneurs. Creating leaders is embedded in our university's psyche; we foster critical thinkers and free-minded people. Our style of education, which is based on the American model, allows graduates of AUB to excel and to launch their own businesses and become entrepreneurs. Regarding the projects that AUB currently supports, we embarked on an important project that involves the launching of an innovation park to create and accelerate new ideas and invest in certain projects that have the component of innovation. We expect this project to be fully operational in the next couple of years.</p><h4>How do you reconnect with your alumni abroad to encourage them to give back to the university?</h4><p>Our alumni are an indispensable source for AUB. We have around 55,000 alumni spread around the world; therefore, we stay in regular contact with them to invite them to give back to the university and to the country in general. Some contribute to scholarship programs, mentoring programs, or to the networking events we organize. The alumni have been extremely generous in their support of AUB at all levels and they are truly the lung through which AUB breathes. </p><h4>What are some of the projects that AUB is involved in in terms of community development and equal opportunities for students?</h4><p>This is important and one of the strategic goals of our new administration is to promote civic engagement and community service works. We have a Center for Civic Engagement and Community Service (CCECS) that reaches out to students to contribute to the community. Our students are often involved in community development programs that widen their minds and move them to help others, which is one of AUB's ultimate missions. We also have scholarship programs that support needy but academically qualified students from Lebanon and from the region. Under these programs, students are required to be civically engaged and to participate in the service of the community so as to enhance their leadership skills. They do that with the help of CCECS. Such programs include the USP/USAID scholarship program, the Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI), and the MasterCard Foundation. We recently started another program (or phase II) of MasterCard Foundation for supporting underprivileged students, particularly from sub-Saharan Africa. The number of students supported by the scholarship programs will soon reach about 500. Recently we also got involved through CCECS with some international agencies contributing to relieve the effects of the Syrian refugee crisis by building schools or sending our faculty members to teach at schools built by NGOs. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main activities that UNESCO will pursue in Lebanon?</h4><p>UNESCO and Lebanon have a long and rich history of partnership, now in its 54th year. Over this time, our partnership has gone from strength to strength, drawing on shared values that have profound roots in the society and history of Lebanon. The wealth of cultural heritage in Lebanon is an open door to the cultural diversity of the Mediterranean, and a strategic asset for intercultural dialogue and mutual understanding. UNESCO is committed to making the most of it for future generations, building on the rich history of Lebanon and its connection with Mediterranean cities. I had the pleasure of nominating Maha El-Khalil Chalabi as UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador for her commitment to the protection of the city of Tyre, a gateway to the history of humanity. We also rely on the support of the UNESCO International Center for Human Sciences in Byblos to advance cooperation in social sciences and promote a culture of peace. Our Beirut office is the Regional Bureau for Education in the Arab States, currently serving 19 Arab nations, and at the same time functioning as a multi-sectoral cluster office for Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Iraq, and the Palestinian Territories. </p><h4>How have the current events surrounding Lebanon impacted UNESCO's scope of action in the country? </h4><p>We have renewed our deep commitment to Lebanon and the Arab region in challenging times. As a result of the Syrian crisis, UNESCO has been working with UN agencies and partners to support the Lebanese government in its successive Lebanon Crisis Response Plans, particularly through the Ministry of Education and Higher Education's (MEHE) Reaching All Children with Education (RACE) strategy, which aims to provide quality education opportunities to all children and youth in Lebanon who have been affected by the Syrian crisis, ensuring the mainstreaming of forcibly displaced people into the national education system. Lebanon is coping with more than a million Syrian refugees, with immense pressure on host communities and institutions, and I wish to commend the government for its unfailing commitment to bolstering the resilience of all women and men in the face of an unprecedented crisis. This is a lesson of courage and dignity for all. I see this same spirit in Lebanon's commitment to the new global 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. UNESCO's role will continue to be clear—to support and accompany the government and society of Lebanon in all its efforts to realize its goals to strengthen the foundations for poverty eradication for inclusive sustainable development and lasting peace across the region. </p><h4>How is UNESCO partnering with the Lebanese government to incorporate and integrate Syrian refugee children into Lebanese educational centers?</h4><p>UNESCO works arm-in-arm with the government in this respect, contributing in particular with the MEHE through technical, financial, and operational support to the implementation of the national RACE strategy and its updated version that envisages a more strategic approach to the education sector response on the premise of a stabilization and development agenda that will guide the work of the ministry for the next five years. UNESCO worked with the ministry to design a national non-formal education policy framework to allow school-aged children who missed out on several years of education to catch up with their schooling and reintegrate into the formal system through certified programs in early childhood education, basic literacy and numeracy, and accelerated learning. We also closely work with the government to develop an accelerated learning program for youth, which will allow students who finished their Grade 9 and obtained their brevet or equivalent but who have been out of school for some time to transition into formal secondary education. The message of UNESCO's Constitution drafted 71 years ago has never been so relevant. The defenses of peace must be built in the minds of women and men, starting with young minds, beginning on the benches of school. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the current state of the education system in Lebanon and what are the ministry's ongoing plans to improve it?</h4><p>We have identified a couple of key objectives that we plan to develop in the following years. First, we will embark on the upgrading of the ministry's curriculum and on improving the facilities of public schools across the country. Most importantly, the ministry needs to work on a law that governs the relationship between the private schools and the ministry in order to set standards that support the evaluation of these schools. The education system includes many schools that are doing great, both in the private and public sectors; however, their success depends mainly on their administration, facilities, and the availability of funds, and here is where we find sharp variations between them. Our education system has many strengths, such as the trilingual education our students receive that helps them gain proficiency in Arabic, French, and English. But we also have many deficiencies, such as not catering more to students with disabilities. This is why the current curriculum needs to be updated, new technologies need to be included and made more interactive, and more extra curricular activities that engage our students in different skill-developing tasks need to be developed.</p><h4>What have been the main actions of the ministry with regards to the need to school thousands of Syrian refugee children and how can other key players get involved? </h4><p>The ministry has taken all the necessary measures on this matter and the program has been running for more than two years now. We started the Reaching All Children with Education (RACE) program, and now it has been upgraded to RACE II, which is a plan to accommodate every child in the territory and give them access to education. Unfortunately, this plan depends on the funding from donors and, so far, we have not been able to raise the necessary funds in any given year to increase the enrolment rates. We have now reached over 200,000 Syrian children in the schooling system in Lebanon, but there are still 250,000 children out of school. By the end of this year, if there is commitment and funding by donors and the international community, we will be able to allocate 100,000 more. We need to call on the international community not to abandon these children. The London conference of international donors has been idle in delivering the promised assistance, and this has caused a shortage in the availability of funds. We are exerting every effort to change this situation and to accommodate every child we can into the schooling system, but we need more contributions to achieve our targets.</p><h4>How are the ministry's policies contributing to fostering entrepreneurial mindsets among Lebanese students?</h4><p>So far, the ministry is not concentrating on such programs, which is one of its weaknesses. Hopefully, part of the plan for RACE II is to upgrade the curriculum and include such activities to embrace entrepreneurialism as an inherent part of the national educational system. Consequently, policies need to be put in place that will contribute to these activities, and we must start looking for students that are talented. We need to develop those talents with entrepreneurial youths that think outside of the box via teaching-oriented methods, but we need a radical transformation in our curricula before we can excel in this.</p><h4>What instruments is the ministry using to reverse the brain drain Lebanon faces and turn it into brain gain?</h4><p>This requires a different movement not under the ministry alone, since we need to ensure the creation of more and better jobs. Also, the political situation in Lebanon needs to improve to encourage scholars to come back and improve higher education, thus contributing to academia. More job opportunities will attract all the brains into Lebanon but this is precisely where the country has been systematically lacking, and this is not a task for the ministry to undertake by itself. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your assessment of the legislation on pharmaceutical commercialization in Lebanon?</h4><p>The legislation in the pharmaceutical sector has developed in a rather positive way due to the close cooperation between all stakeholders in the public and private sectors. The LPIA has taken an active role in the process of laying out the necessary laws, decrees, and ministerial decisions to structure a regulatory framework that works according to the sector's needs. Today, we have a regulatory framework that is well advanced in comparison to neighboring countries. Moreover, the pharmaceutical sector in Lebanon is probably the best-regulated sector after the banking sector. However, the major problem comes from the modernization and application of the regulations, which is where we need bigger efforts today.</p><h4>How has LPIA contributed to the development of R&amp;D in the Lebanese pharmaceutical industry?</h4><p>R&amp;D is practically nonexistent in the pharmaceutical industry in Lebanon. The small spheres where it is actually present are at the level of a few manufacturing sites and the development of some generics manufactured under license from multinationals or locally packaged to be sent abroad in an economy of scale model. Even though LPIA has no direct contribution to this development process, we encourage the regulatory measures to facilitate such developments and remove the various barriers to entry put in place by neighboring countries against Lebanese pharmaceuticals.</p><h4>How is the sector working with local start-ups and SMEs to innovate in the industry?</h4><p>The profession of importing and distributing pharmaceuticals is being challenged in two opposite directions: one being demanding but rather conservative that addresses the good storage and distribution practices in an advanced and complex way; and the other, even more demanding and forward looking, calls on all players to be creative and prepare themselves to face the challenges of bio-pharmaceuticals and patient-oriented therapies. There are start-ups already developing niche services in the industry, although they still represent a minor role when looking at the whole picture of the health sector.</p><h4>Are there many opportunities for the commercialization of generics in Lebanon?</h4><p>In 2014, generics constituted 34% of the market in units and 27% in value. This is a great percentage given that the prices of generics are lower than the prices of originators. The awareness campaign initiated by the Ministry of Public Health with the application of the provisions of the law allowing a pharmacist to substitute, in specific cases, the medicine prescribed by the doctor and the introduction of the unified prescription has had a positive effect in this respect. Nevertheless, the eagerness of most multinationals to reduce the prices of their originators after their patent rights expire does not facilitate the penetration of generics, leaving them with relatively low market shares.</p><h4>What opportunities are there for Lebanon to become more self-sufficient in terms of pharmaceuticals?</h4><p>Lebanon is a small market that faces problems getting its locally produced medicines into neighboring countries and low levels of investment to develop a local pharmaceutical industry. That being said, the Ministry of Health has established a policy to coordinate with big multinationals to create a good balance between high-quality products and fair and affordable prices. The timeline to get prices down is also being kept under control so that all stakeholders will reach a fair understanding on how to balance the benefit-cost of having such early access to medicines.</p><h4>What are your projects to take the work of LPIA even further?</h4><p>Our objective is to keep cooperation at its highest professional level between private stakeholders—multinationals, local manufacturers, pharmacies, hospitals, and doctors—and the public sector, represented by the Ministry of Health and public institutions. We want to have the regulatory framework moving ahead with modernization and efficacy. On a practical level, we have four immediate projects that are being finalized: the execution of good storage and distribution practices, the signature of the newly updated Code of Promotional Practice, the introduction of a national barcode system on all medicines, and the destruction of pharmaceutical waste through an environmentally accepted method. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have technological applications made the difference in your projects?</h4><p>We have visionary people leading the company and this adds to Sakr Real Estate's innovative approach to developments. We create concepts rather than mere changes and we incorporate the best technologies worldwide. This is something we developed in the Admir project, which will be in the intersection of three different municipalities, as it will expand over time to have a wellness center and a commercial hub. This type of project follows up on our strategy to develop smart living spaces in Lebanon. </p><h4>How did the partnership with Remax start, and what are your expectations from this new chapter in Sakr's history?</h4><p>We signed the partnership with Remax in December 2015 when we decided to cover the sales part of our business ourselves, sort of a one-stop-shop. We wanted a well-reputed international company that people in Lebanon could easily recognize. This is how we moved on to approach the owner of the Remax franchise in Lebanon to acquire 90% of the shares of the brand in the country in a two-sided strategy where we would benefit from a big name in real estate commercialization, and it would benefit from maintain 10% the shares of Remax while seeing its company grow as Sakr expands its scope of action in the local market. Remax is the number one real estate broker in the world, and this fills Sakr with an unprecedented opportunity to bumper its real estate sales force. We have entered a new era where Remax will further strengthen our position in the local market. </p><h4>Once Remax is fully integrated to Sakr's operations, how will this transform your approach to the market?</h4><p>The partnership will entail sales of franchises and licensing, as we do not do transactions or operations, and this will be carried by Remax. We established two particular subsidiaries to cater for Sakr's needs—Remax Properties for transactions on apartments, villas, and any other building project we undertake, and Remax Land to manage land spaces. These two subsidiaries come to complement the other six outlets the brand has in Lebanon and will go in line with the noted plan to open several outlets across the territory. What we will look into now is how to match the traditional Lebanese way of selling property with Remax's way, since they are different concepts with unique models. What I plan to do from now on is to promote the Remax model for potential agents, where they can get higher commission for at least 40% of the property price, while they only get 10-15% in the traditional agencies. </p><h4>How will this relationship take Sakr to the next level, and where do you see the partnership going in the next couple of years with new projects that Sakr will have?</h4><p>Adding Remax into our operations has multiple-sided effects. Firstly, we will have an autonomous sales force with independence in governance and administration. This will enforce sales since Remax will go in our own direction and it is also the largest brand in the world. Secondly, the Remax model has to do with a clear network of the business that gives us access to anywhere in the world with agents still getting their commissions despite allocating properties in third markets. This is an extremely dynamic model not available in other international real estate brokers. We do not want to deviate too much from the original business model of Remax since it has proven successful and unique in many ways; we want to build up on this model to create something beyond this success. Finally, once this business model takes a hold on Sakr's operations, I am sure we will move on to other markets to have coverage through our joint venture. Currently, our aim is to prove ourselves in the Lebanese market and once we are successful at home, we will go abroad and take our business model to the next level. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the Waterfront City project evolved and what is its current status?</h4><p>Waterfront City is a mixed-use integrated development that offers a welcoming and clean residential neighborhood, multi-experience retail offerings with a strong emphasis on the F&amp;B sector, a state-of-the-art business park, and a complementary high-end hospitality offer, all tied in by a pleasant walkable and green public realm. It is virtually the heart of a city that offers an unmatched location on the Mediterranean with a vibrant enjoyable lifestyle, overlooking one of the largest marina on the eastern shores of the Mediterranean. Due to the relatively large size of the project, among other constraints that are inherent to the local market, we have been developing Waterfront City in stages with strict adherence to the highest international standards applied to all the different components of the project. Our project has been well received locally and in the region in general, especially Lebanese living locally and in the MENA region and aspiring to have a home to come back to. To put this into perspective, the numbers speak for themselves, as in the first active phases of the project we have sold 505 units, representing 75% of the total units on offer, of which 80% were sold to local Lebanese and 20% were sold to Lebanese living abroad.<br>Moving on, we started construction of the second residential phase of the project, of which we have received strong demand as well. In addition, we will be starting the first phase of our Business Park development toward the last quarter of 2016.</p><h4>How is this concentration of business, residential, and commercial spaces at Waterfront City increasing the appeal of the project?</h4><p>It is the synergy between the different elements of this project that comes into play to define its uniqueness in the region. Waterfront City is not developing and selling residential units in the clear sense of the word; rather we are employing Majid Al Futtaim's experience and know-how in mixed-use development to offer a distinctive lifestyle to our residents, visitors, and all those who are connected with Waterfront City directly or indirectly, that is unique, fun, and carries with it great memorable moments for everyone every day.</p><h4>The Lebanese diaspora and the other markets where you operate represent a pool of potential buyers for this project. Have you structured any particular strategy to attract them?</h4><p>Lebanese expatriates definitely represent potential clients of ours, and we have been hard at work ensuring our project's visibility to them wherever they are. In this context, we have been active in promoting Waterfront City project in all major real estate conferences and exhibitions, on the local and regional level. We organized road shows, and have also tapped into Majid Al Futtaim's extensive market reach into the MENA and GCC regions. In addition, we have been quite accommodating in our products mix to offer products that are adaptable to the needs of such target market buyers. </p><h4>Do you have other projects in the pipeline?</h4><p>At Waterfront City, and in completing the offer, we have progressed in the design of the Majid Al Futtaim second mall in Lebanon, which will be similar in size to the Beirut City Center, and have well advanced on the level of the required approval process. In addition to all the major brands, the mall will host a Carrefour hypermarket, VOX multiplex theaters, and a Magic Planet, with a total investment in excess of USD500 million. The mall will also be accompanied by a four-star business hotel that carries with it an investment of USD250 million, in addition to further residential development of the same magnitude. We are looking into the development of a third mall, but this option is still on the drawing board. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the link between Stevin Rock and RAK Rock?</h4><p>Stevin Rock was founded in 1975 as a 100% owned subsidiary of Dutch Company Volker Stevin until being acquired by our new parent company, Dragomar, S.P.A., in 1990. That year saw us form a joint venture to support the building of the Ras Laffan Port in Qatar, for which we supplied five million tons of material. In May 1996, the government of RAK purchased Stevin. Until then, RAK Rock and Stevin Rock were two separate companies that competed for projects. RAK Rock remained loyal to its code, which was to supply raw material feed to the cement plants, even though both Stevin Rock and RAK Rock are owned by the government. In October 2007 we discussed the unification of the management of our companies, although the companies remained technically distinct for various strategic business reasons.</p><h4>What are Stevin Rock's landmark projects?</h4><p>We were involved in all the megaprojects in Dubai, such as Palm Jumeirah, Palm Jebel Ali, the World Islands, Burj Khalifa, Dubai Metro, Dubai Mall, Dubai International Airport expansion, JBR projects, Dubai Festival City, and Jebel Ali Container Terminal, amongst others. At the moment we are involved in projects such as the Upper Zakkum project, SARB, Das Island by ADNOC, Small Boat Harbour, and the new LNG terminal project in Bahrain.</p><h4>What are the main export markets?</h4><p>After the economic downturn in 2009, we decided to diversify our markets and looked at India for a product niche there. When India produces steel in the steel plants, they need flux injected into the furnace, and one of the ingredients to make steel is raw limestone, and that limestone has to be of superb quality in terms of the balance of minerals within it. A Japanese group was looking at building a nickel plant in Madagascar with a Canadian firm. We met and negotiated with them, won the job, and we've been sole suppliers to that nickel plant for the past four years. Around 25% of our production went to markets outside the UAE market. In 2015, we were invited by the Qatari government to discuss the supply for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. We signed a QAR1 billion contract, which would make us the largest raw material supplier to Qatar over the next five years, and we would supply around 40 million tons over five years. Along with that, we expanded our capacity, building a new crushing plant for AED150 million, and expanded our harbour for AED30 million. We are now ready to commission our new plant in August 2016, and that will be to supply and support the Qatari market first and foremost. There's also Expo 2020 coming up, and we are already supplying all the ready-mix plants in Dubai that are working on construction projects related to the event. After India and Africa, we decided to expand into Europe. In Ukraine, we talked with a steel plant to discuss supplying limestone, because its supply line had been cut and now we are its sole supplier of limestone. We are also the lead supplier to Bahrain and Kuwait. We supply the cement for a GCC-funded, USD5 billion housing project, and in Kuwait we're supplying limestone to a cement factory there. Our new target is London, and we want to supply materials that are cheaper than the UK's own domestically produced materials. We are building a new deepwater berth for the purpose, which will help us halve the sea transportation cost to London.</p><h4>How much importance do you attach to environmental standards and eco-friendliness?</h4><p>In our industry we have to practice the latest and best standards and look for the latest technologies all the time. Therefore, environmental control measures have accounted for around 10% of our capital expenditure over the last five years, during which time we have implemented and maintained an environmental management system that meets all of the requirements of ISO 14001:2004. We work in close cooperation with Ras Al Khaimah Environment Protection and Industrial Development Authority, including introducing across all our sites advanced dust extraction systems that prevent environmental pollution. We have also totally enclosed all primary, secondary, and tertiary crushers, as well as screens, conveyers, and product bins. As well as further improvements in encapsulation, 2016 will see the development of the fogging cannon spray system principle and the trial and subsequent use of wetting, foaming, and crustation additives in dust suppression water.</p><h4>How would you assess the role of quarries in RAK's economic development?</h4><p>RAK does not have oil resources; the mountains have been a rich source of raw materials to various industries such as cement, construction, and steel industries in the UAE, Gulf region, and Asia. We have the capacity to produce and sell more than 70 million tons per year of high-grade limestone, gabbro rock, concrete, and asphalt aggregates for the construction and manufacturing markets in the UAE, Gulf region, and Asia.</p><h4>What are your prospects for the year ahead?</h4><p>We started our new expansion plans forecasting the demand of aggregates in the GCC and other Asian regions. We are expecting to add a new production line, called crusher 22, producing 12 million tons per annum at the Khor Khuwair quarry. We are also expanding crusher 11, producing an additional 1.5 million tons per annum at Al Ghail quarry. There will also be crusher improvements and expansions targeting the production of an additional 1 million tons per annum at Kadra quarry. We have very good prospects for the next three years with continual improvements in operations to be sought.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some milestones for DHL in Lebanon in the past year?</h4><p>The most important milestone is the increased frequency of DHL flights into Lebanon, which has gone from three to five flights per week. DHL now flies a Boeing 757 freighter into Beirut from Tuesday to Saturday. This provides us with further control of our operational platform and our customers with later cut-off times and better transit times. The recent increase in DHL flights has not only improved our core Time Definite service offering, or what is commonly referred to as our “courier" service, but it has also improved Economy Select service levels. Economy Select is a service designed for shipments over 150kg that do not require a next day or second day transit time. Whether a customer is sending a document, a spare part, or a two-ton order of electrical components, they are all transported on our own network, fully DHL owned and managed.</p><h4>The closure of the Syrian border has created opportunities for businesses in Lebanon. What have been the benefits for DHL in particular?</h4><p>The closure of the border in Syria is the result of a tragic conflict and any “opportunity" is overshadowed by this tragedy. We have seen some increased activity from the Syrian business people who have relocated to Lebanon and the increase in shipments transiting the airport but we hope these customers will soon be able to return home. In the meantime, we will do our best to provide solutions that ensure business continuity for them.</p><h4>What have been the major benefits from the Beirut Free Zone for DHL?</h4><p>Our free zone operation in Lebanon serves customers who want to bring their goods into the country by sea to be re-exported or distributed throughout the region by air. Due to the prevailing situation in the region we have not seen many customers setting up their distribution networks out of Lebanon. Our free zone operation is underutilized but we still see great potential in Lebanon's role as a redistribution center. Over time, I am sure this part of our business will grow and become more profitable. </p><h4>How feasible is the idea that Lebanon can become a regional logistics hub?</h4><p>We have always said that Lebanon has the know-how, the human resources, and the geographical location. We now have better infrastructure as a result of the extensive investment in the Port of Beirut, and a new state-of-the-art cargo terminal has been created at the airport. However, for Lebanon to develop into a regional distribution center, the business community has to be confident in the sustainability of such a proposition.</p><h4>How is DHL approaching e-commerce start-ups, and how are you working with these new entrepreneurs?</h4><p>We have been involved in e-commerce for many years. This sector and the companies involved are exciting, dynamic and present great export opportunities. Recently the fashion and design industry have been quite active, and a number of Lebanese businesses have jumped onto the global stage thanks to e-commerce. As the most international company in the world, DHL is ideally positioned to deliver its customers' products anywhere on the planet. We have developed systems that seamlessly integrate into our customers on line platforms to ensure that shipments get delivered on time and that the information flow is timely and efficient.</p><h4>What projects do you have in line for the coming year?</h4><p>We will continue to develop flight operations and find ways to add value for our customers wherever possible. There will be continued focus on e-commerce; especially on the design sector, which continues to go from success to success, and we will continue to look for ways to improve wherever and whenever we possibly can. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>2016 marks the 10th anniversary of Al-Akhbar. How has your work transformed the media landscape in Lebanon?</h4><p>We made the decision from day one that Al-Akhbar would be a non-traditional newspaper. This has been reflected in our attitude and opinion about all the events in Lebanon and around the world. The late Jospeh Smaha, our founding Editor-in-Chief, declared from the beginning that we oppose the imperialist forces that are trying to spread their hegemony all over the world. This non-traditionalist decision extended itself to the layout of the newspaper, where we used a new format that had not been seen in the market before: a front page with large photographs and a minimal word count on a smaller paper size compared to other political newspapers in the region. Our website also reflects the newspaper's approach as it is easy to navigate, there are dominant white spaces, and the simplicity in the color is evident. Such design and attitude has inspired other newspapers and media outlets to adopt new, non-traditional designs as well. </p><h4>Al-Akhbar has a highly independent approach toward news in the region. How does this characteristic contribute to attracting wider and more diverse audiences?</h4><p>By being highly transparent and independent, people trust us. Readers are intelligent and are able to differentiate between independent, anti-corruption news sources and monotonic ones. The fact that we have also adopted a progressive approach toward social issues, human rights, and values add to the credibility that we enjoy in the media industry. We reflect Al-Akhbar's core values and those of the people of these countries.<br>How is Al-Akhbar coping with the global trend for the digitalization of media?<br>We constantly review and analyze new trends. For example, web surfers are referred more now by social media posts rather than visiting the webpage URL, so we tackle this market with focal strategies to have presence in social media and develop long-term plans for these platforms. Today we have about 1.8 million Facebook followers. We are currently updating our website through an aggressive media approach that was released in August, as well as mobile apps to be released before the end of the year. We are also working on a monetizing strategy for our website.</p><h4>Al-Akhbar is one of the most popular newspapers in the Arab world. What steps have you taken to grow in markets different from Lebanon?</h4><p>More than 60% of our website visits are from outside Lebanon. This exhibits the valuable trust of our readers. Unfortunately, the political realities in the Arab world do not tolerate a highly independent newspaper such as ours and thus we do not publish locally in other countries. However, we appeal to our readers in the Arab world through our truly wide network of local writers and freelancers who are embedded in their local communities and reflect their attitudes, needs and tastes in their articles.</p><h4>Do you have any new features to implement in the upcoming years?</h4><p>Part of our 10th anniversary is to include supplements in our printed edition and progressively release these new features throughout 2016. We are widening our commercial supplements scope as well, an area that we will further explore in the years ahead. Digitally, we will have a major overhaul of the website with new services and a completely new technology platform. We will also release our own mobile apps before the end of the year. On a more colorful note, we just published a successful supplement to Game of Thrones, and due to its great success, we will continue to offer exclusive supplements in coming issues. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the current state of the ministry's plan to have full fiber-optic coverage by 2020?</h4><p>The FTTX project is running on schedule. According to the plan, the first year was dedicated to enhancing DSL services in remote areas in preparation for these areas to have fiber-to-the-cabinet (FTTC) services, as well as providing some pilot “heavy users" with fiber-to-the-building. The pilot phase of the FTTC is being implemented according to schedule and we will now start the fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) pilot in dense areas where the need for high broadband has been expressed. For the 4G (LTE-A), mobile service implementation is to be finalized by end of September 2016, with a full coverage to be launched before the end of the year. In order to accelerate the accessibility to high-speed internet before the full deployment of fiber, I am considering launching special packages using 4G technology as an interim solution that will be used as a last mile connectivity in areas where fiber will take the longest time to be completed. We will finance these developments using revenues collected from our various services such as mobile telephony through both mobile operations, as well as from fixed phone and DSL, which provides the necessary funding for these investments. Implementation will be done in phases, specifically for FTTX, whereby the funds will be allocated on a pay-as-you-implement mode, which will be spread over four to five years. Also, each additional service will provide additional revenues, which in turn will fund the next phase of the project. The 2020 Vision creates new dynamics both on the social and economic front.</p><h4>You have been an advocate of the expansion of 4G connectivity throughout Lebanon. How will internet users benefit from this expansion? </h4><p>There are plans to make 4G available in all areas of the country before the end of 2016 and cover major cities by the end of September of 2016. I have asked all 4G suppliers to commit to our requested timeframes and the rollout is working according to plan. I have personally followed up this project and regularly meet with the concerned teams to receive updates and solve the difficulties that crop up. On the other hand, pricing is currently being studied in order to accompany our plans and fit our 2020 Vision. The users will therefore benefit from a faster and wider coverage of high speed internet with more affordable pricing. </p><h4>A project to privatize the main two mobile carriers has been in the air for several years. Is this plan achievable in the mid term, and what would be the key benefits of this?</h4><p>In 2002, we issued Law 431, which, among other things, stated the creation of Liban Telecom, a semi-private company that would take over all the fixed telecoms infrastructure and start a third mobile operator. Law 431 has been signed and approved but unfortunately only partially applied, since it still needs some amendments to update its legal frame and implementation decrees. With the current vacancy at the head of the country, this is impossible to achieve. I have shown my inclination for the application of this law and am working hard for its full implementation. Once Law 431 will be fully implemented, competition would be further enhanced and will improve the creativity of the operators while delivering higher quality of service in compliance with international standards. The customers will, therefore, benefit from better service at reduced prices allowing them to better focus on the development of their own activities. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the key developments at ABK over the past year?</h4><p>There are two key developments that stand out. Last year, we had identified our target, Piraeus Bank Egypt, and started negotiating. The acquisition of the bank took place in November 2015 after about six months of negotiations, a record time for such a transaction given all the processes and regulatory approval requirements. We have traditionally been a local bank with only a marginal presence in the UAE, but due to our operational expansion to Egypt, we have technically doubled our branches and staff and become more of a regional bank. On the operating side, we are continuing the solid trend of the past couple of years. For the first half of 2016, we achieved top-line revenue of KWD44 million, slightly ahead of last year. To be fair, this growth was a bit below our expectations, but remains faster than the market. The low oil prices have reduced business activities and, consequently, led to a decreased demand for loans and investments. This has obviously impacted the banking sector, but we have been able to maintain some limited but reasonable growth. The other big change was the launch of our new strategy, where we aim to differentiate ourselves through “simplification." The truth is that nobody likes to go to a bank and do a transaction as it has become a headache, and there is a vast range of new requirements. In this regard, it is important that banks have a clear vision and strategy, which need to be articulated and communicated in simple terms so that people can understand it, live it, and own it; that has been one of our Bank's key strengths, which is a clear set of core values, vision, and strategy. Our vision is “reimagining a simpler bank," and everything we do is about making life simpler for our customers; and our core values are “transparency, integrity, simplicity, and excellence." These are key concepts that everyone here can understand and, more importantly, live by. It is that single-minded focus that probably explains the relative success that we've had. Aside from that, we have shifted our focus more toward the top line (i.e. the longer term), rather than the bottom line (i.e. this or next quarter). The top-line revenue growth is critical for the long term and, over time, we believe that the bottom line will eventually and automatically follow. In the short term, however, the bottom line may be distorted by the impact of the one-offs, such as precautionary provisions, but over time such distortions will normalize and correct themselves.</p><h4>Is ABK looking to expand operations to other GCC countries aside from the UAE?</h4><p>We were the first Kuwaiti bank to have a presence in the UAE, starting in the late 1960s. However, we never really focused on the business there, but rather on serving our Kuwaiti customers in the Emirates. However, our activities in the UAE have doubled over the past two years, despite the difficult environment that Dubai and Abu Dhabi have been facing. Overall, the GCC is a calmer and less turbulent business environment, which is why GCC growth is lower than the growth that you would expect in places like Egypt and Turkey, which have higher risk and therefore also higher growth potential. But it is not the political or economic risk that prevents us from entering new markets, but rather our recent large acquisition of Piraeus Bank. It is important to walk before you run, and we are not aiming to enter new markets in the next few years, unless of course an opportunity we cannot refuse comes knocking on our door! Now that we have a presence in three key countries in the Arab world, our aim is to grow organically in Kuwait, the UAE, and Egypt. In terms of revenue and profitability, Egypt and the UAE make up 10-15% of our net income, and ideally that share could reach 25% rather quickly. That is where the focus should be, taking advantage of what we have rather than adding more things.</p><h4>To what extent is ABK involved in financing current large-scale infrastructure projects?</h4><p>We are excited but are somewhat frustrated that those projects are not coming as fast as we hoped. We have built a corporate finance and project finance team within ABK from scratch, with people who have the ability to structure complex, non-recourse types of loans and facilities for the financing of these types of projects. We have helped on a couple of bids and the submission dates were deferred, but this is a huge potential for banks. Some of the transactions could be financed through bonds, while others would be better financed through syndicated loans and so on. Each has a different aspect, but we are fully prepared with a formidable team in place and are looking at every opportunity be it in the education, housing, health, water, waste management, and power sectors. The last three sectors mentioned above are sectors of particular interest, but we look at every single one of those development projects. On some projects, we make a conscious decision that we do not want to get involved, either because the margins are too low for the risk we take, or because we believe that the proposed financing structure is not tight enough. However, we still decide to participate in many of the projects that we look at, but we generally would want to participate as a lead arranger in most of the cases. We have the technical capabilities, credit appetite, liquidity, and capital.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>The first half of the year was generally difficult for the banking sector due to the depressed oil prices, as this translated into slower business investments and demand for loans. My expectation is that this will continue over the next several quarters, although we still hope next year would be better. However, all the indications so far seem to indicate that things will continue to be relatively difficult through 2017. But everything is relative: when Europeans say it is difficult, then it means a drop in GDP, and in China when people say things are difficult then instead of growing at 10%+ they are growing under 7%. Here when we say things are difficult, we still mean that the growth rate will be positive, albeit fairly anemic. That is my view, and when the situation is difficult, it requires the bank to be more proactive and take more provisions, which inevitably will impact the bottom line. This year will not be a great year for banks, and I hope that next year will be better; but realistically, I do not count on a full recovery next year.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did the idea of Circular 331 come about and when did you decide to build momentum on the knowledge economy?</h4><p>The concept started in 2013 when we noticed that something was going on in the Lebanese startup ecosystem; however, the industry was still somehow in the shadows. We began talks with major players in the industry to measure the potential this could have in the years ahead, and by August 2013, Dr. Riad T. Salameh himself drafted a circular about the knowledge economy. When Circular 331 saw the light, the concept was new to the banking sector and to most people in Lebanon, so it took some time to grasp and take off as a valid project. Circular 331 allowed commercial and investment banks in Lebanon to invest up to 3% of their capital in knowledge economy startups with a 75% guarantee on its investments coming from Banque du Liban. This created an initial platform of USD400 million available for the ecosystem, which is a great number for a country the size of Lebanon, and has been pushed even further to reach an amount of USD500 million today. This circular has created major momentum for startups in Lebanon; everyone is talking about the ecosystem; the private sector is becoming increasingly interested in them; and, more importantly, we have created a culture of entrepreneurship in the country. Through the disbursement of funds for the ecosystem, Circular 331 has released the potential of the knowledge economy in Lebanon to turn it into a pillar for the country's economy. It has also served as a platform for Lebanese talents to go abroad and shed the attention from international investors to this industry. </p><h4>Some players in the ecosystem talk about a gap in funding between seed-stage and advanced startups. As the regulator of funds, how is Banque du Liban working to cover this gap? </h4><p>When the disbursement of resources started there were only two funds catering only for mid-stage startups with more potential for successful exits. Up to a certain extent, this was the result of the hesitation raised by banks when funding early-stage startups for the doubts surrounding their development. Once we came across the need to further incentivize seed fund, we pushed for the creation of more funds at this stage, and we currently have two specific seed-stage funds operating in the ecosystem. There are many professional people out there who have landed innovative ideas and need funds to kick off their startups, so we tried to diversify the scope of venture capitals and funds at every step of the way to create a comprehensive scheme for funding. We solved the gap problem by creating two funds at the seed stage, two at the intermediate stage, and two at the growth stage. </p><h4>Banque du Liban has identified the knowledge economy as one of the three flagship sectors for Lebanon's development in the near future. How will this sector impact the Lebanese economy?</h4><p>We think that if the whole scheme is deployed as planed, it will constitute 1% of the GDP within three to five years. Our target is to create 20,000 jobs in the ICT sector by 2025, especially in the key sectors that the UK Tech Hub has identified for the upcoming years, namely retail, fintech, and healthcare. We have maintained a conservative approach about the potential of the sector, but if things improve in Lebanon in the short-term, the number could jump even further. During these complicated times in the country, Banque du Liban has come out with subsidies, stimuli, and initiatives that have all proven successful and have maintained this ship on float. The initiatives spurred in the knowledge economy will be no different and this sector will indeed become a beacon of progress for Lebanon in the years come. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Diageo's program to prepare its human talent and mobilize it around the world?</h4><p>Diageo has a project called Early Career Program, whereby fresh graduates join the Diageo Academy for three years and undergo on-the-job training by rotating across different departments. Once they graduate, we encourage them to apply for a job within Diageo in an area where they can perform and grow; they grow to become managers and Diageo future leaders, and even enter our mobility program to fulfill their aspirations to go outside of Lebanon. We help them find a job in another country. In that sense, Lebanon has become a pool of talent for Diageo, globally fostering and growing talent fluent in three languages and always prone to global exposure. This will be one of my main tasks as head of Diageo, to develop young talent that will shape the company and the country in the years to come.</p><h4>What does Lebanon represent for your global operations, and how does the country help with Diageo's development in the MENA region?</h4><p>We have a fully fledged team based in Lebanon with members distributed across commercial and functional areas, further reconfirming Lebanon's position as a priority market for Diageo and ensuring the right focus is given to customers, consumers, brands, and the wider industry. Lebanon is a unique and dynamic market, in particular with its nightlife and celebration culture. The nightlife environment is a major brand building and growth driver and that makes Lebanon for Diageo very much equal in nature to large markets such as the US and Europe and gets the same level of attention. What makes Lebanon outstanding is the fact the people love and appreciate life and love to celebrate and that is the core of our business and purpose regardless of the challenges the security or economy present. This is also a key pillar of Diageo's establishment in the market, which is enough reason for us to further engage and build local communities that thrive. We want to give back to the country that has shown its commitment to us from day one. From here we cover around 10 countries in the Levant and North African regions.</p><h4>What are some of Diageo's flagship CSR projects in Lebanon?</h4><p>“In Good Spirit" is our latest local platform developed to engage communities, consumers, customers, government, and many other stakeholders toward promoting a responsible handling of alcohol covering consumption, service, and sales. This includes consumer awareness, customer venues protocol, and capability building to ensure our products are consumed responsibly and served responsibly. We also recently launched a Diageo "Join the Pact to Never Drink and Drive" program within In Good Spirit, seeking consumers and partygoers to sign a pledge. We have also done a great deal on the environment front, planting 1 million pine seedlings in the Shouf area and engaging NGOs and more than 60 municipalities to collect and plant these seedlings in various geographical areas to support the national reforestation initiative. We have also been active in the empowerment and capability building streams, launching Diageo Lebanon “Plan W," a global female empowerment program that aims to train and build up women's business and entrepreneurial capabilities to improve their employability and offer them opportunities to grow and become leaders. </p><h4>Lebanon has always been identified for its good nightlife and outgoing nature. What makes it so appealing?</h4><p>Lebanese people by nature are outgoing, love celebrations, and have all the freedom to do that. Its people are highly educated with mixed backgrounds and Lebanon is home to investors with entrepreneurial acumen and the energy to establish innovative restaurants, bars, and clubs. When talking about nightlife in the Middle East, Lebanon always comes up. There is a high return on investment and a high number of people coming in from neighboring markets that makes nightlife in Lebanon a world-class sector with a promising future. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some major contributions by ALI to the sector in 2015?</h4><p>We have worked with different industries to help them meet international standards and comply with regulations. This is not a primary issue for Lebanese industrialists as they have proven to be completely committed to the best standards. We export goods, particularly in the food industry, to the most demanding markets, including the US and Europe, and we work in line with their requirements. Another issue was the port reorganization by the Ministry of Finance. This has disrupted the flow of incoming goods to some extent; however, we have been able to minimize the damage for concerned industrialists. We have also helped the government play a major role in compensating those export companies affected by the border closure due to the Syrian war. Furthermore, we are cooperating with the government and the central bank on a program to enhance exports through more facilities for working capital for exporters. ALI has also played a significant role in promoting Lebanese industry through visits and delegations abroad. We have a solid base of skilled professionals as well as a network of connections via our diaspora. Lebanon can be a hub for international companies, and we want the international business community to realize that.</p><h4>What has been the involvement of ALI in the subsidy program to alleviate Lebanese industrial exporters?</h4><p>We have extensive involvement in this decision, and it has largely alleviated some of the extra costs that hampered our exports globally. We have been telling the relevant government officials that cumulatively our exports have gone down by USD1 billion over the last three years. If the government worked on recapturing this loss by reinvesting even USD50 million, this would allow the Lebanese economy to recover the USD1 billion lost. Lebanon has been carrying the burden of negative external effects that have taken their toll on our economy and ALI is doing everything in its power to contribute to solving these issues.</p><h4>How will the four industrial cities planned by the Ministry of Industry transform the industrial landscape in the country?</h4><p>Industrial land is scarce and expensive in Lebanon, so the fact that we have access to industrial cities is by itself a relief and an encouragement for all those who want to set up manufacturing facilities. Most companies also have to set up their own logistics network and this project will allow them to access cheaper land with full services in one single place. We have seen plenty of interest in the project from international organizations that assist Lebanon, and this is a good opportunity to attract some international anchor companies to set up subsidiaries here in key industries to spread the word on the opportunities present for other industries to be based here. For example, if the automotive industry comes here, it will bring with it related manufacturing companies, so this is an exponential investment. This will create clusters where one company will bring its peers to Lebanon, and we are truly excited about this new project.</p><h4>With all the exciting projects going on here, what do you see for the future of industry in Lebanon?</h4><p>The Lebanese industry has so far contributed 10-12% of GDP and has created no less than 130,000 jobs. This has been done mostly due to the private sector working on its own despite all the odds. If we give the industrial sector more tools, the possibilities of what we can do are countless. We are excited about realizing our potential, including in terms of more exports as we have a diversified portfolio of high-quality, well-designed products to sell to the world. We are also keen on Lebanon becoming a base for the industrial production of high-tech and value-added products with the current development of the knowledge economy. We look forward to international cooperation between Lebanese industrialists and international groups for the benefit of the whole region. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Since being established in 1941, the CCSS has worked to reduce child mortality and increase life expectancy. How has the organization evolved in the way that it carries out its mission?</h4><p>CCSS is a unique institution in Costa Rica because it was established not only by law but also by the constitution. This is important because in the beginning the main focus was on extending social protection such as healthcare access to more people, especially workers in the formal sector. In these 75 years, we have increasingly covered more kinds of workers, including informal workers and independent workers. The primary source of funding comes from the workers, the employers, and the state, which is markedly different from other systems where funding comes from tax payments or out of pocket ; our social security system is an adaptation of the Bismarck model. The CCSS was originally a healthcare system for people affected by disease; however, we now integrate services such as health promotion and prevention, immunizations, and a holistic approach to healthcare, from primary healthcare through tertiary care. It provides comprehensive care: Costa Ricans can receive immunizations to prevent diseases as well as top of the line cancer treatment, cardiac disease management and organ transplants. Our package is implicit, not explicit, meaning that we are charged with serving all those in need of healthcare services. We make no distinction between the individuals of different income groups; everyone living in Costa Rica has the same opportunity to benefit from quality comprehensive healthcare services. This kind of universal healthcare coverage make Costa Rica stand out as quite different from other countries, and we are proud of this. This approach reduces child and maternal mortality rates, and our life expectancy is around 81 years, with much of the population living well beyond 80 years. As with other countries with a growing elderly population, we are in the midst of an epidemiologic transition, where the population still suffers from acute infectious diseases but is also being afflicted by chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular ailments. The management of these diseases is more expensive, so one of the challenges that we are currently addressing is the strengthening of a system that would follow individuals throughout their life cycle—through health promotion, disease prevention, opportune care, and management of disease, rehabilitation, and palliative care in end-of-life conditions.</p><h4>What are some of your current projects and initiatives?</h4><p>Patients in this day and age are technologically savvy and require easy access to information about their own health processes and health in general. Applying cutting-edge technological advances to health also allows us to optimize resources, provide the healthcare teams with opportunities to collaborate with their peers in distant locations, and to share patient information that will result in more efficient care and better health outcomes. The medical records are being digitalized in their entirety, beginning at primary care and continuing through the highly specialized hospitals in the nation's capital. This effort requires a technological platform that will support this initiative in every healthcare establishment in the country, so clinics, hospitals, and administrative offices are being fully equipped for this purpose. Of 1040 national Basic Teams for Integral Health Care (EBAIS), 94% have implemented the agenda module, 83% have loaded the family records module, and 81% have uploaded all heath charts into the EDUS system. 73% of the hospitals are utilizing the surgical module in their surgical departments. Another key initiative is the project entitled “Fortification of Health Care Services" to improve the health of the population in the entire healthcare system by strengthening primary care. After careful analysis of key indicators, a region of the country was selected to become the originator of innovations that are centered in the patient, and improve the experience and outcomes in every scenario, from home, school, and community, through primary care and regional, national, and specialized hospitals. Multidisciplinary teams conformed by healthcare professionals from each of these scenarios are the ones responsible for crafting and implementing this paradigm shift in the way healthcare is designed and provided in this country.</p><h4>What strategy is CCSS following to solve the issue of patient waiting lists?</h4><p>Like other systems that offer universal healthcare, waiting lists are a challenge that we are addressing with creative, patient-centered initiatives, designed and driven from the hospitals themselves. We are working with different kinds of strategies to increase the optimization of our capacity and resources, including alternative schedules, specialized ambulatory surgery campaigns, and optimization of surgical suite utilization among others. Influenza vaccine administration is another example of opportune patient-centered care. Costa Rica's comprehensive immunization schedule includes 15 different vaccines for children and adults. Special at-risk populations like children younger than two years of age, the elderly, and those suffering with other pre-existing conditions like asthma or diabetes, were prioritized when the vaccines were administered.</p><h4>How do you assess the Costa Rican healthcare sector overall?</h4><p>Our healthcare system is strong, both in the private and the public sectors. Most private-sector players are providing specific services, such as consultation. Most high-end interventions are only offered by the public sector. The principal message I would like to convey is that operating a social security system in Costa Rica takes time and commitment on the part of politicians, the private and public sectors, the workforce, and the general population. We need to move toward a consensus as a society, not just to build and strengthen the system, but also to build the sustainability of said system. The CCSS is an integral and essential part of this effort to provide healthcare services that produce the best health outcomes for all inhabitants of this country, with special emphasis on vulnerable populations.</p><h4>What are your priorities for 2017?</h4><p>The priorities for 2017 have been established in the institution's strategic plan 2015-2018, which has been developed across three strategic axes: healthcare services, institutional management, and financing. Each axis has strategic themes that include health, pensions, infrastructure, information technology and communication, evaluation and accountability, human resource management, and financing, among others. Priorities for 2017 include implementation and evaluation of the project for the Integral Development of Strategic Functions of Human Resources, Project for the Organizational Restructure of Central Administration, and the Fortification of Health Care Services project. Infrastructure projects include remodeling emergency services and building new hospitals where population changes have exceeded current capacity. Innovative technology will also be a pivotal component of prioritization in 2017, not only for health services but also for education, including telemedicine and apps for patient use. The CCSS is being positioned to evolve significantly over the next several years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the LCEC transformed the energy efficiency landscape over the last 11 years?</h4><p>Lebanon is part of the regional center for renewable energy and energy efficiency, so we compare our achievements here with the achievements of other countries in the region. Lebanon has made huge progress in this regard. In 2009, the government set an objective to reach 12% renewable energy by 2020. Today, we have installed more than 30MW of solar photovoltaic panels in the country and rank among the top 10 countries in the world in terms of solar water heater installations. Lebanon was also the first Arab country to adopt a national energy efficiency action plan, and we are currently ahead of the curve in comparison with our neighbors. Lebanon also boasts one of the best financing schemes for sustainable projects in the world through NEEREA, a project launched by Banque du Liban that has allocated over USD450 million in projects and offers loans with a zero interest rate over a period of 14 years.</p><h4>How would you assess the level of awareness in Lebanon for energy conservation?</h4><p>Lebanon has the most widespread awareness among the Arab world. However, we lack the development of large renewable energy projects such as hydropower plants or large wind farms to materialize our advances in the field. Such projects could also contribute to achieving our 12% target. The positive side of this is that decentralized projects at the consumer level in Lebanon tend to be efficient and active with initiatives, and this is the case with most energy efficiency projects. This is why individual solar heaters, renewable energy in hospitals, industries, or shopping centers, and nearly all the actions are decentralized, are booming.</p><h4>What is the level of coordination between the public and the private sectors regarding energy efficiency?</h4><p>LCEC functions as the technical arm of the Central Bank for loan requests to implement any type of energy or environmental project, which we review and assess before handing them for approval to Banque du Liban. LCEC is part of the Ministry of Energy, too; hence, we constitute the link that binds the public and the private sectors. When it comes to the LCEC, there is a great level of coordination between both parties.</p><h4>How would you assess the level of greenhouse gas reduction in Lebanon?</h4><p>We are not doing too well in that sense. Lebanon has a small contribution to worldwide greenhouse gas emissions, contributing less than 0.07%, but we are still not doing a great job in bringing greenhouse gas emissions down. We are also not doing well in waste management and deforestation. From the traditional power sector point of view, the fuel- and gas-based industry, we are also not doing well. We have a lot of room to improve.</p><h4>What can be done to improve energy efficiency in Lebanon?</h4><p>In 2011, the government approved the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for 2011-2015, covering energy efficiency and renewable energy. We will publish the 2016-2020 plan for efficiency and renewable energy in two separate action plans for each. Financing has been flowing and funding has come in good numbers; for instance, we just received USD1.5 million as a grant from USAID and another EUR18 million from the European Central Bank. We are also building technical capabilities among engineers, technicians, and bankers. Now, the biggest effort must focus on the creation of new laws and regulations to set the rules for the industry, which takes time but is completely feasible.</p><h4>Do you think the 2020 strategy will meet its targets?</h4><p>Yes it will, and we will need to set our target for 2030 now. We try to keep things realistic. We could say we will reach 80% renewables by 2050, but we would not believe it. So 12% renewables by 2020 is realistic. That covers 12% of overall energy consumption in electricity and heating, which is a huge yet achievable scale. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What strategy do you take to attract foreign investors to Lebanon?</h4><p>From day one, we structured our strategy around attracting leading companies with technical expertise, long experience in deep offshore, financial strength, and with a good record track in QSHE. Once the strategy was in place we started working on putting the regulatory framework together to guarantee the targeted companies about the secure environment for investments in the country. We want companies to come and invest here for 30-40 years, and they need investment returns and to see that the legal framework will not change from one day to the other just because the government wants it to. We cannot fight the regional instability that characterizes the Middle East; however, as an authority we can reduce the impact here. The LPA is committed to offering investors a comforting investment climate in Lebanon.</p><h4>Apart from the taxation system, what other legislation can render Lebanon more attractive for investors?</h4><p>We do not seek any form of upfront payments from companies before they enter the market as we do not want them to feel like there are barriers here. The oil system greatly depends on prices, quantities, and the capital destined for expenditures, which turns it into a progressive system whereby companies will be happy to make money when things are happening. We have a strong private sector in Lebanon, strong engineering and legal firms, and people with experience in business, all of which minimize the risks for multinationals. We have also carried out seismic surveys, mapping out 80% of potential reserves with 3D seismic data available for companies to check their prospects for exploration beforehand, also reducing the risks for investment.</p><h4>Do you plan to connect Lebanon to the pipelines coming from the Gulf to Europe?</h4><p>There is an existing pipeline running from Egypt to Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon all the way up to Turkey called the Arab Gas Pipeline. Right now, the prospects are not positive due to the situation in Syria and the high expenses. There is also talk of regional cooperation to build a pipeline linking countries such as Cyprus, Israel, and maybe even Egypt to provide gas to Europe, but so far it is just an idea. The LPA has conducted studies on our export options; however, this has to wait until we make a discovery and options actually materialize.</p><h4>Lebanon is in need of investments in infrastructure. What are the major opportunities investors can find in this regard?</h4><p>The energy sector is the best sector to invest in Lebanon right now. This not only involves oil and gas but an entire energy chain in need of processing facilities, reservoirs, pipelines, power plants, renewable energy projects, distribution networks, and transmission. There has been a great level of underinvestment here for the past 15 years, which provides a valuable opportunity for local and foreign investors. There is a great need for investments and more services for the industry, which will come with time once we start awarding tenders to move forward with these projects.</p><h4>How many years will it take for Lebanon to be energy self-sufficient?</h4><p>If there is good political will, we could be self-sufficient in five years. Once we build a pipeline to the shore and provide good quality natural gas, all the power plants could operate on natural gas. I recently signed a MoU with the Association of Industrialists to make progress in putting the oil and gas process in place. Once we are able to export energy, it will transform the dynamics of the country.</p><h4>What role will the LPA play to ensure projects become a reality and fulfill objectives?</h4><p>We are currently working on upcoming plans for the next four to six years and are preparing the regulatory framework for health, safety, and the environment. We are also increasing cooperation programs with multinationals, countries with previous experience in the field, and with institutions to attract investments, expertise, and supervision. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the current refugee crisis and the region's instability affected Lebanon's environmental policies?</h4><p>The Syrian crisis has disrupted environmental policies in a significant manner. At the upstream level, environmental considerations are not considered as a priority in emergency situations, which has made it impossible to proceed with an environmentally sound planning process in the country. Despite the efforts to initiate the National Sustainable Development Strategy in March 2015, this process remains unfinished and has not become a priority in the national planning agenda. Although the Syrian crisis had a major impact on the environmental and natural resources of Lebanon, policies and plans to respond to these impacts have not been acted upon.</p><h4>What have been the ministry's measures to tackle the trash crisis Beirut has been facing?</h4><p>The ministry took the first action even before this crisis occurred by trying to prevent it and actively participated in the ministerial committee established for the purpose of integrating a common vision on solid waste management tenders, the first time this was ever done in Lebanon. The process for the tenders, however, was not easy in most regions of the country, particularly in the Greater Beirut area, where the tenders had to be repeated up to three times. At the end, a total of 17 consortiums of Lebanese and international companies participated in the bids, with six recommended successful candidates by August 2015. These bids, however, were not approved by the Council of Ministers, and the ministry left the committee, even though it maintained its role as a counselor on the issue.</p><h4>How would you assess the level of awareness regarding the use of renewable energy in Lebanon?</h4><p>The renewable energy sector gained momentum after the Copenhagen Climate Summit in 2009, when the Lebanese government voluntarily engaged in having a renewable energy share of 12% over the total use of energy by 2020. That engagement has created a national awareness in both the public and the private sector, which is demonstrated by the uptake of energy efficient but more importantly renewable energy measures. The ministry has also mainstreamed climate change with the public sector and has pushed for ambitious actions in that regard. Despite these advances, we are still critical about the incompleteness of the effort in the matter and have pushed other governmental agencies to move toward renewable energy technologies and to embrace them as a priority for the energy future of Lebanon.</p><h4>How is the ministry working with its counterparts in other countries to attract investments to the environmental sector in Lebanon? </h4><p>The government, through the ministry, has ratified most of the key environmental conventions and protocols, namely those on climate change, protection of the ozone layer, persistent organic pollutants, protection of the Mediterranean Sea, and the like. This has opened the door to direct funding from international organizations to further improve the implementation of these measures and to adopt the regulations implicit in these conventions.</p><h4>What measures have you promoted to minimize the environmental footprint of the oil and gas sector the country is seeking to develop?</h4><p>A strategic environmental assessment (SEA) was carried out for the sector from 2010-2011, and the Lebanese Petroleum Administration (LPA) together with the Ministry of Environment is following up on the smooth implementation of these recommendations. Accordingly, a second phase of the Oil for Development Program was signed with the Norwegian government; this program includes several environmental activities. </p><h4>What are your prospects for the development of sustainable policies in Lebanon in the next five years?</h4><p>In March 2015, the Presidency of the Council of the Ministers, in coordination with the Ministry of Environment, launched the roadmap for the national sustainable development strategy (NSDS). The draft NSDS includes seven strategic objectives: providing world-class human capital; strengthening social cohesion; providing citizens' daily priorities; enhancing economic growth; preserving natural and cultural heritage; promoting good governance; and repositioning Lebanon on the Arab, Mediterranean, and international maps. Consultations about the draft NSDS are expected shortly. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What actions has the ministry taken to propel the industrial sector and make it a top generator of employment? </h4><p>For the ministry, 2016 signifies the first year that the 10-year strategy for the development of the industrial sector, Lebanon Industry 2015, was implemented. The aim of this strategy is to implement protection policies to the industrial sector against imported products since production costs here tend to be higher than the actual prices of commercialization, especially when compared to other markets in the region. This plan has included some key industries for local production, from dairy products, poultry, aluminum, paper, and paintings, among many other goods. We also have obstacles in terms of the cost of energy, land, and labor, and the difficulty in competing with mass production from countries much larger than ours. We have also identified some industries that are sensitive to the development of local production, such as cement, generators, electrical transformers, cables, and other resources vital for production, and have launched policies to cover them for the well-being of the nation.</p><h4>What are the benefits of your subsidy program for sea freight exports and how long do you intend to carry on with this program?</h4><p>Our exports have suffered a severe hit in numbers since the closure of the Syrian border. Half of our exports used to go by land through Syria, reaching other markets such as Iraq, Jordan, and the Gulf. We launched this maritime exports program to counter the negatives effects accrued by the closure of the border and to enhance our industrialists' ability to maintain their profits. The two sectors that have benefited the most from this program are industry and agriculture, especially those products that need refrigeration and are time-sensitive. The outcome of this subsidy program was positive and we decided to extend it for another year.</p><h4>You have actively promoted tax incentives for industrial research. Can you tell us about your expectations in this area?</h4><p>Industry in Lebanon represents around 8% of GDP, or around USD5 billion. There are great opportunities to grow our industrial capacities since they have been under operating in recent years; however, we need to invest in research before that happens. We are realistic about the size of our economy and we know our R&amp;D will not match that of more developed nations. I have called attention to the need to invest in this field since it has been overlooked throughout our history. I am aware about the complexities and that most people think about survival rather than investing in research, but we need to look to the long term if we want to move away from that survival mode.</p><h4>What industries hold the biggest potential for the years to come?</h4><p>There are many industries that look promising at this stage, for instance furniture, plastics, jewelry, fashion, ICT technologies, and of course the oil and gas industry. Some of them are growing at a good pace, while others present many opportunities that have not been exploited yet. We need to assure niche markets for investors and producers before taking these industries further. If they are able to market and export their products, they will be interested in investing and producing more.</p><h4>What do you foresee for the future of the industrial sector in Lebanon?</h4><p>I see a sector that is able to create job opportunities. Lebanon needs to create around 40,000 jobs every year, and we are not fulfilling that quota right now. With the industrial cities, the push for exports, and the development of the new and promising sectors in the market, we should reach those numbers soon. We also plan to focus more on agriculture since this has been an underprivileged sector for many decades. The ministry recognizes that this development is not a choice; it is a duty and we are working to achieve that. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your evaluation of the insurance industry in Lebanon?</h4><p>The insurance sector has been growing effectively in the past few years, and at a larger pace than most industries in Lebanon. It is undeniable that growth has slowed down in comparison to the numbers it presented a few years ago, but this responds to instability and political stagnation rather than deficiencies in the sector itself. If we look at the numbers, they are positive. They look promising, and we cannot deny that Lebanese insurance companies have found their way to remain resilient no matter how dark the panorama is. Industry-wise, we have seen a steep decrease in the marine insurance segment due to the Syrian conflict that hindered the former export activity to Syria, Jordan, Iraq, and other markets. With the evaporation of this trading route and the position of Lebanon as a hub, insurance companies have lost an important part of their business in the local market.</p><h4>What have been the major challenges Al Mashrek has faced, and how have you come up with innovative solutions to counter them?</h4><p>We have pushed hard over the past four years to increase the percentage of collection of our premiums and to lower the deficit of collection to maintain a good client portfolio. Some of our clients have been with us for years, and paying their premiums has become increasingly tougher; therefore, we have shifted to adapt to these needs. All the international compliance regulations, such as Basel III, that have been recently applied have also taken their toll on how the sector operates, pushing banks to minimize their shares in their own insurance companies, pushing them to have a more aggressive approach to the market. The fact that we are not connected to any banking institution leaves us in a more vulnerable position to counter these effects; hence, we came up with those solutions.</p><h4>How has the policy of mandatory insurance from the banking sector shifted the needs of regular insurance companies?</h4><p>An increasing trend in the Lebanese insurance market is the ability of banks to incorporate mandatory insurance policies into their loans, which has indirectly affected all players in the insurance sector. Due to the monetary situation, many businesses are shifting from traditional insurance to bank insurance, which is why the top-10 insurance companies are dominated by bank insurers. We have been challenging this situation for the past few years, and were able to maintain a fair level of the market share. We use our cash reserves to stay alive in this stagnant market. The challenge now is how much longer can we sustain this trend and remain competitive.</p><h4>Have you incorporated any technological applications to your product portfolio? </h4><p>As a businessman with a background in technology, I can tell it is still too early to invest in technological applications for the insurance industry in Lebanon. The bulk of customers purchasing premiums in Lebanon come from the heads of family, who tend to be older and usually not involved in technological applications and novelties. Also, the implementation of mobile applications and technological advances requires a fair level of internet speed at an affordable cost, which we do not have in Lebanon for the time being. The percentage of potential customers to cater through technological applications remains too low for us to have a big incursion in this segment.</p><h4>What do you see for the future of Al Mashrek in the next couple of years? </h4><p>My prospect is that in two years we will remain as stable. We witness a small growth in our business through the operations we have in Lebanon and Egypt. I do not think we will perform any expansion to other markets for the time being, and we already have enough branches to cater to the Lebanese market. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were your key objectives when setting up the ADGM in the UAE?</h4><p>The ADGM was established to support Abu Dhabi's ambition to be an international financial center. Through foresight and prudent management, Abu Dhabi has created one of the largest sovereign wealth funds in the world and is internationally recognized as a wealth center. It is a natural progression to harness its strengths as a wealth center, with world-class infrastructure, political stability, and security, as well as a high quality of life, education, and healthcare to develop itself as an international financial center focusing on private banking, asset management, and wealth management. The objectives were mainly to develop a conducive ecosystem to support local institutions to grow to become regional and international champions and to attract international players to center their activities here to serve the fast-growing region. We engage our stakeholders closely to understand their needs to fulfill these two objectives and have created a full spectrum of investment and legal structures that support the needs of asset management companies, private banks, insurance companies, and family offices. In response to the high cost of capital post financial crisis, we worked closely with the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) and other stakeholders to develop an effective and efficient capital netting jurisdiction. To cater to the demand for a clear and genuine common law jurisdiction, we adopted common law in its entirety and that gives the industry legal certainty with a full body of up-to-date case law.</p><h4>How do you tailor international standards to the Abu Dhabi financial sector?</h4><p>We draw from the best practices of successful financial centers around the world and assure alignment with international standards. This allows institutions to operate in an environment that they are familiar with, minimizing compliance costs for global firms that conduct global compliance practice, and assuring a high level of confidence amongst stakeholders. We also work closely with our stakeholders to cater to local needs. The ADGM regulatory model stands on its own in the region. We are an integrated regulator across the banking, insurance, and capital market sectors. This allows us to have a more holistic view of risks. Given the increasing blurring between the different types of products, the ADGM framework allows us to better support our stakeholders in terms of their offerings. Second, the ADGM is responsible for providing a sound, progressive, and vibrant financial services center. The attractiveness of a financial center does not rest only with its legal and regulatory framework, but the broader ecosystem including ease of establishment, time to market, availability of talent, tax treaties, and so on. Together with stakeholders, we are developing an ecosystem that is conducive for financial intermediation and innovation to take place. We have a calibrated authorization framework that caters to both large institutions and boutique firms, based on the business risk and complexity that these players bring. It is not a one-size-fits-all criteria.</p><h4>How do you see the financial framework evolving as the sector develops and financial technology advances?</h4><p>It is a continuous process because international rules and regulations evolve as well. At the same time you have to ensure that you push ahead with your agenda to help local and international institutions. An advantage of the ADGM in this regard is that our board is able to enact new rules and regulations swiftly to respond to the needs of the marketplace. Among the key initiative of the ADGM is to support Abu Dhabi to become the financial technology innovation hub to support the GCC region. We have been in talks with potential partners in the US, Europe, China, and this region about developing the ecosystem to support the fintech industry. We recently issued a consultation paper that proposes that establishment of a regulatory laboratory, a first in the region, and which will provide a controlled environment for fintech players to develop, test, and launch their products and offerings subject to regulatory safeguards.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Designing the Market]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[designing-the-market]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate BSE's operations during 2015?</h4><p>The year 2015 witnessed relatively modest trading movement on the BSE. In the year's 241 trading sessions, 74.6 million shares were traded for a value of USD629 million, compared to 96.8 million shares valued at USD661.4 million for the year 2014. This represents decreases of 22.9% and 4.9% in the volume and value of shares traded, respectively. Total listed capitalization remained almost unchanged at the end of the year 2015 at the level of USD11.22 billion. Finally, the value of secondary public offering in 2015 decreased by 85% to reach USD80 million against USD521 million in the year 2014. This may be attributed to the political situation in the country and the large extent to which this situation is deterring administers to get involved in the BSE or for the already listed ones to come out with new activities.</p><h4>Nearly 90% of companies listed on the BSE belong to the financial sector. How are you attracting companies from other sectors to diversify operations?</h4><p>Diversifying the structure of listed companies on the BSE is one of the biggest challenges the stock market has been facing since its reopening 20 years ago. Lebanese businesses are in their vast majority small, family-owned firms that prefer to finance their activities through bank credit in order to keep control over their companies. These companies do not see the advantages of being listed on the stock exchange; clearly, they are more influenced by the banking culture and would rather prefer to go under bank's umbrella. On the other hand, almost all big companies are still owned by the state with no clear plan for privatization in the near future. We are trying to correct the current situation by giving increasing attention to educational and promotional programs that aim to attract and convince medium-sized Lebanese companies to list their shares on the BSE and to increase their capital through the broadening of the shareholders' base by highlighting the importance and advantages of financing through the stock exchange. We need first to recognize the specific needs faced by start-up companies and address these in an appropriate fashion. Start-ups need the financing that the BSE can help raise. At the same time, they are not always prepared to meet reporting requirements that currently exist on our exchange and do not have the kind of resources necessary to inform investors on a regular basis about company developments. We can help by designing a special market (to run in parallel with the official market and the junior market) for these companies with lighter reporting requirements and listing rules. </p><h4>How will the eventual privatization of the BSE change the public's view on the institution?</h4><p>A private stock exchange will give its management flexibility in doing business. The public will be more confident to trade here. Local as well as foreign investors will see that things are moving forward in Lebanon. Hopefully, investors will also come back en masse to the country once the political situation is stabilized.</p><h4>What have been the major transformations brought about by the CMA?</h4><p>Currently, the CMA is in the process of updating and releasing new regulations. Up until now, the CMA released 20 regulations that govern financial markets, disclosure policy, crowdfunding, insider trading, derivatives, securitization, and collective investment schemes as well as regulations concerning financial institutions, brokerage firms, and the suitability of those selling financial products.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the BSE in the following year?</h4><p>The future of the BSE depends fully on the completion of the privatization process, since this will signal the true engagement of the financial sector. Once this process is implemented, I hope that Beirut recovers part of its former position as a leading financial capital market in the Middle East. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What changes will the first licensing round for oil and gas exploration bring about in terms of investment for the sector?</h4><p>The ratification of the two pending decrees for the licensing will allow the Lebanese government and the Ministry of Energy to close the first licensing round and award the relevant blocks to launch exploration and offshore production activities. Needless to say, large resources will be needed to carry these activities, which will boost the sector and all auxiliary and complementary sectors that benefit from the potential development of oil and gas in Lebanon.</p><h4>Have you structured a particular model for a sovereign wealth fund for oil and gas revenues in the country?</h4><p>This is stipulated by the Lebanese Offshore Petroleum law 132/2010, which clearly and unequivocally states that all revenues originating from petroleum activities will be placed in a sovereign wealth fund. We are still waiting for a law to be put in place that will structure the fund and determine the entire procedure before moving forward with these recommendations.</p><h4>What was the outcome of the five-year National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP) program, and are there any plans for 2016-2020?</h4><p>The first NEEAP 2011-2015 included 14 initiatives in energy efficiency and renewable energy. In the last five years, the ministry invested all efforts to implement the NEEAP. Early in 2016, the Lebanese Center for Energy Conservation (LCEC) conducted a full evaluation of the NEEAP, and the results show that almost 60% of the NEEAP initiatives have in fact been achieved, which we believe is a good success rate; however, the important thing now is to benefit from our pitfalls and try to implement the new NEEAP 2016-2020, which is already published. The objectives of the new NEEAP are challenging, but given the progress made in this sector, I am quite confident that the success rate of implementation will be much higher than its predecessor. I am also pleased to announce that the second National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) 2016-2020 will be published in September 2016, which reiterates the commitment of the Ministry of Energy to reach 12% of renewable energy by 2020.</p><h4>How has the Central Bank's NEREEA project transformed the approach of the private sector toward energy efficiency and renewable energies?</h4><p>The NEEREA national financing mechanism has proven to be the best financing mechanism in the region, with more than USD450 million in loans implemented in this sector. The Ministry of Energy, through the LCEC, is a main partner of the Central Bank in the NEEREA development, and, thanks to NEEREA, the private sector is witnessing remarkable momentum. For instance, the latest study by UNDP and LCEC shows the solar photovoltaic market has doubled between 2014 and 2015, and the current installations in 2016 indicate that growth will more than double between 2015 and 2016. NEEREA has inserted a sustainable energy culture into the Lebanese private sector, and we are proud of that.</p><h4>The Lebanese government set a target to increase renewable energy consumption to 12% by 2020. How feasible does this target look four years away from the deadline?</h4><p>The plan for the next four years will be made public soon. In this new plan, Lebanon is committed to reaching the 12% target, which translates into 833 ktoe, and that is a number to remember. The ministry is working on three main paths to reach our national objectives. Wind energy and solar energy for electricity production would represent one major milestone, with a projected share of 3.96% of the targeted 12%. Solar water heaters and biomass are another important milestone, with around 4.8%. Last but not least, benefiting from hydro resources for electricity production would be essential with a percentage of around 3.24%. The ministry will not spare any effort to make the 12% target a reality. Progress is made at the level of decentralized solar systems, solar water heaters, and other technologies. A giant step would be the initiation of the wind farms, which we hope to launch soon. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the major contributions of JTB to the Lebanese economy since you were first established?</h4><p>We have been part of Lebanon for over 50 years, providing financial services to a wide array of customers. Lebanon has a large number of people working in the informal sector, in what is often called the “grey economy." When we talk about the informal economy, we mean those small family businesses and micro-shops that are not formally registered on government books, but still have their fair share of economic development in the country. JTB has been there since the outset to actually support these promising micro-firms; this has been our major contribution to the overall economy.</p><h4>How has your customer-sensitive approach set you apart from other banking institutions in Lebanon?</h4><p>There is a popular birthday wish in Lebanon: “We hope you live to be a hundred years," which we often apply to entrepreneurs opening a new business in the form of “We hope you become the largest in your sector." For JTB, this has never been the case. Since its emergence, the bank has never aimed to become the biggest player in the financial sector, nor to become the largest bank. Stretching our capacities to these spheres would make us lose our 'uniqueness' and force us to treat our customers as just numbers rather than individuals. Something that still makes JTB what it is today: to serve people. We want to have a genuinely personalized approach to banking; something that has gotten lost in most places around the globe.</p><h4>How has JTB promoted microfinance, and what benefits does the banking segment bring?</h4><p>We were the first bank to introduce micro-credit into the Lebanese market. We started this segment 17 years ago serving the unbanked; those who would recur to their neighbors or friends to borrow cash and who would end up paying back multiples of what they initially borrowed. We approached those people who were skeptical of dealing with banks, and we encouraged them to abandon their taboos of not using banking institutions for their financial needs. It is of relevance to mention that microfinance is often confused with the microcredit you can obtain from a retail shop to purchase a determined item. As opposed to microcredit that only aims to improve people's livelihood, microfinance aims to lend money to people to develop their businesses and improve their livelihood. </p><h4>Considering 90% of Lebanese companies are SMEs, has JTB found its niche market in this segment?</h4><p>One of the characteristics that is constantly overlooked about the SMEs operating in Lebanon is that only around 50% of them are officially registered on government books, with the rest operating informally but still contributing enormously to the economy. Throughout JTB's history we have catered to all those small businesses in Lebanon and effectively managed to migrate them from the unbanked group to the bankable group of businesses; and they flourished. It has been a demanding journey and we, at JTB, are proud of every step, every touch point, and every turning point. A journey some large banks decided to shy away from, there is a know-how, an appetite, and a certain finesse required to do business with these small firms.</p><h4>Looking ahead, where do you see JTB going in the next two years?</h4><p>We will move up a few notches in the industry but never pass the 15th position in the overall banking sector ranking. This is because of the reasons I explained before that set us apart from other players in terms of customer satisfaction and how we approach them. Our slogan “We Speak Your Language," remains as strong and as real as ever. That does not mean I do not dream big. I would like to see JTB move abroad to other markets in Africa and in Europe to serve our clients needs there. We have big plans for the future, but with cautious steps as we have always been. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>This year marks the 60th anniversary for BBAC. What are the bank's main accomplishments, and how has it transformed throughout its history? </h4><p>BBAC is one of the few banks in Lebanon that still retains the same DNA it had at its inception 60 years ago. My father established this bank in 1956, and he reflected his culture and values into it. Among the most important values, providing jobs to his fellow Lebanese, increasing their living standards, and integrating the youth into the labor market were the main drivers for him. After he passed away, I took over the leadership of BBAC in 1996, and I kept holding firmly to those values my father long fought for. Now, BBAC is one of the major banks in Lebanon with 40 branches covering the territory. We were the first banking institution to believe in rural development and to grant loans to small businesses in the extensive rural areas in the country; we contributed to bringing many small businesses back to their feet and being sustainable. Over time, we also evolved to become the first bank to introduce computing into our systems, to become the pioneers in IT technology applied to banking services. We have also believed in Lebanon, and we have kept an active presence in this country regardless of the political or security situations we have been through. </p><p>What factors account for your good performance, despite regional instability and economic shocks?</p><p>In 2015, BBAC ranked number one in terms of growth in deposits and number three in terms of the loan portfolio among Lebanese banks. We achieved this due to our good reputation and our decision to be more aggressive in marketing, both locally and internationally, where we have started to make some good inroads. We have been aggressively targeting corporate clients, and this led us to succeed in increasing our loan portfolio substantially. Outside of Lebanon, we have been able to maintain our presence in the Iraqi market despite the insecurity and the drop in oil prices that have hindered that country's economy. We were among the first foreign banks to go into Erbil, and this meant we were able to choose the cream of the business clients. Rather than being affected by the situation in Iraq, we have seen a small growth in profitability. We were also active in 2015 on treasury operations and our trading assets, as well as on the retail and consumer lending segments, where we maintained a healthy ratio.</p><h4>How has BBAC become involved in the promotion of entrepreneurial projects and the development of the knowledge economy in Lebanon?</h4><p>This sector is expected to balance the brain drain effect in favor of Lebanon since large parts of its educated youth will stay in the country. The Central Bank's efforts have driven this industry to new spheres and have encouraged commercial banks to follow suit in funding these projects. We believe banks can have a larger involvement if we have specific members of staff dealing with the knowledge economy, which is why we have decided to invest in the sector indirectly through the capitalization of incubators and accelerators and promoting young entrepreneurs by lending to them through Kafalat's loan guarantees. We see a great future in this industry and the development it will have for small businesses operating in sectors such as agriculture, small industries, artisanship, and tourism.</p><h4>What is your vision for BBAC in this landmark year for the bank, and what are your main objectives for the next two or three years?</h4><p>We will continue expanding our presence in Lebanon to cover any regional gap; we will continue to strengthen our external market penetration. We will engage in a larger number of IT projects since this is the future of banking. Finally, one of our upcoming projects is to launch the rebranding of the bank to inject fresh air to our image and increase our visibility. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the assets that make Lebanese insurance companies strong in the MENA region?</h4><p>Lebanese companies have a great deal of experience with wars, conflicts, and tough conditions; therefore, we understand other areas going through such difficult situations, be it Iraq, Syria, North Africa, Egypt, and the like. We have the connections, the resources, the expertise, and the kind of experience and appetite for those countries, not to mention the know-how to navigate rough waters where other companies may not see any potential or have appetite for risk.</p><h4>Lebanon is facing economic adversities, yet the insurance sector remains strong and sound. What are the factors that account for that?</h4><p>All industries have been hit by the situation, but they are all adapting well to the circumstances. Take the hotel industry, for instance. Hotels had an occupation rate of 54% last year, despite all the problems, and today it ranks fourth in the MENA region. The Lebanese economy remains vibrant in spite of everything; people are out on the streets consuming and spending, and the country still represents a gateway to the region for many companies. For the insurance industry, 2015 represented a growth of 2.5% in non-life insurance and 6% in life insurance, with an average of 3.5%, which we consider low but still positive. We are now leading the industry in new endeavors to overcome its challenges.</p><h4>Lebanon has the highest life insurance penetration in the region, but it has the potential to be even higher. How can this rate be increased?</h4><p>We have made some progress in this regard after the implementation of compulsory insurances by governmental decision. Now Lebanon has compulsory insurance for an extended variety of things. This move has also been embraced by banks, which ask people to be covered in terms of fire, life, and car insurance, among others, before granting any loan. The most important part is that people are realizing the benefits of insurance coverage and they are moving in the right direction. Something that we can also develop in the near future is life insurance and pensions, since the awareness of people has increased and premium prices are also going down. Now, it will fall on the new generation to evaluate and promote the value of having life and pension insurance coverage.</p><h4>What is the history of Commercial over the last 50 years, and how has it evolved in Lebanon?</h4><p>Commercial is a third-generation business that my father started in 1961 after he spent some time working in the insurance sector in Egypt. When he came back, he had good connections here in Lebanon and also with the insurance market in London, so he started his first contracts in marine insurance covering fruit and cigar exports. As he expanded his vision in the sector, he hired a group of professional brokers and set up one of the first insurance companies to operate in Lebanon. We faced difficult times during the Civil War, which ultimately led to the near end of the company in 1978 after our office was destroyed. Nevertheless, being good Lebanese, we proved resilient, and here we are 40 years later as one of the most competitive insurance companies in the country.</p><h4>How has Commercial Insurance remained strong throughout the tumultuous times Lebanon has faced? </h4><p>We have been through many things for over 55 years; however, we have always remained loyal to our clients, and they have been loyal to us in return. This client-company relationship has given us a great reputation that neither time nor conflict can diminish. The Lebanese people know that we stand by them. We also focus on niche products. Health insurance and motor insurance make up about 60% of our portfolio. We are also expanding again; we are moving abroad to start operations in Iraq and are planning to enter Iran soon. We have managed our relations and networks well, and that has kept us on the rise. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[outperforming]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the milestones for Bank Audi during 2015, and how would you assess the group's overall performance?</h4><p>Bank Audi achieved a good performance last year, despite persisting regional uncertainties affecting our three pillar markets of Lebanon, Turkey, and Egypt. We had a 15% increase in the bank's consolidated profits, which is attributed to all main entities rather than to a single one. We have adjusted our operating conditions in a way to improve our spreads, enhance our non-interest income generation, and limit increases in our operating expenses. Breaking down the consolidated performance over the main markets, Bank Audi (Lebanon) witnessed an increase in net earnings amid sluggish economic conditions, mainly as a result of achieving productivity gains and improving efficiency. Within this context, Bank Audi's operations outperformed the domestic banking sector in both markets in terms of asset growth, loan growth, and deposit growth, adding a few basis points of market share for our subsidiaries. Growth in revenues has accordingly more than compensated the negative impact of the depreciation in the exchanges rates in both markets, with the Egyptian pound depreciating by 10% and the Turkish lira by 25% in 2015, translating into a 15% increase in nominal net earnings.</p><h4>How did Bank Audi work through these currency devaluations?</h4><p>The exchange rate correction that both Egypt and Turkey recently went through did not affect our overall economic performances in both countries, as witnessed by their relatively high growth rates. It also did not have a material impact on businesses, mostly due to a structural effect, as 75% of our Egyptian activity is denominated in local currency, while the ratio reaches 50% for our Turkish operation. Having most of our capital denominated in local currency minimized the impact of these currency corrections, since limited lending in US dollars reduces the risk of impaired loans. When looking at the evolution of our non-performing loan ratios in both markets, they improved in spite of the magnitude of currency correction. In all cases, correlation of NPLs in both markets with GDP growth rates is much higher than their correlation with exchange rates. </p><h4>Odea Bank became a top-10 bank in Turkey in less than four years. What was your strategy to build up Odea in the Turkish market?</h4><p>Our strategy for Odea Bank has been focused on making it a real challenger bank in Turkey. The concept comes from doing more by using less, from building state-of-the-art infrastructure able to quickly support our franchise building in terms of accounts, customers, loans and deposits, and credit cards. Today, Odeabank has established a universal banking model and market leading productivity levels as well as strong brand recognition and customer awareness. We rank ninth in the general spectrum of banking institutions in the country, and we have a larger portfolio than global banks with over 25 years of presence in Turkey. We have remained realistic about our potential in the Turkish market, and we have hovered between Tier 3 and Tier 2 banks. Now, we aim to become number seven among conventional private banks in the country, which would position us between the lower range of Tier 2 banks and the upper range of Tier 3 banks.</p><h4>What steps does the country need to take to become an export-driven economy?</h4><p>Lebanon needs efficient, basic utilities such as electricity, water, telecommunications, and transport. Government capital spending on infrastructure has been hovering around 1.2% of GDP over the past five years against an average of 5% for emerging markets. The evident challenge facing Lebanese policymakers is to ensure necessary infrastructure upgrades without putting at risk fiscal consolidation requirements at large. Adjusting fiscal imbalances in order for real interest rates to go down is important in this direction. It is also a matter of political commitment to guarantee basic infrastructure and put the necessary reforms and the right adjustment plans in place to ensure macroeconomic efficiency. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Lebanese parliament recently passed four financial bills to comply with global financial standards. How will these laws enhance the regulatory framework for the banking sector?</h4><p>The bills approved by the Lebanese parliament in 2015 are fundamental, since they uphold the credibility of the Lebanese banking sector and send positive signals for investors within international financial circles. This comprehensive package includes laws regulating anti-money laundering, the declaration of carried cash at the border, the exchange of tax information, and the adherence to UN convention for the suppression of the financing of terrorism. The ABL was an advocate of the importance of these laws to be passed since we needed to strengthen our existing legal framework and comply with anti-laundering international rules. Needless to say, these laws also protect the work and the practice of Lebanese banks at this level vis-á-vis correspondent banks and the international community in general.</p><h4>One of the main assets of the Lebanese economy is the high level of dollarization it presents. How does this aid the resilience of the banking sector?</h4><p>The level of dollarization in the Lebanese economy has many advantages and disadvantages depending on the sector. The existing dual currency system largely supports expansion in financial intermediation and contributes to a deeper financial system. Dollarization in Lebanon contributes also to financial stability and offers an insurance policy against large shocks. The ease with which LBP-denominated accounts can be converted into dollar-denominated accounts tends to limit potential withdrawals from the system and financial outflows in upsetting situations. Therefore, high dollarization in Lebanon can be viewed as one of the elements of the resilience of the banking sector.</p><h4>The banking sector has heavily promoted entrepreneurial projects in Lebanon. What are the main contributions from commercial banks to start-ups and SMEs?</h4><p>The major contribution from banks to the promotion and development of SMEs is the provision of loan facilities below the market costs of tradition funds, since they grant different forms of subsidized loans to these entities in close relationship to loan guarantors in the country such as Kafalat. These loans also benefit from the deduction in reserve requirements and by stimulating packages of liquidity provided by Banque du Liban at very low rates. Today, the outstanding amount of these loans exceeds USD5.5 billion. Banks also support the growth of the knowledge economy, as they contribute within the limits of 4% of their capital to finance start-up projects, business incubators, and accelerators. The interest from the banking sector in these initiatives has moved them to invest around USD250 million in startup companies and venture capitalists so far, and my guess is that this trend will continue to rise, as the knowledge economy has positioned itself as one of the most promising sectors for Lebanon.</p><h4>The Lebanese banking sector is highly competitive. How does the ABL work to make things even for smaller players with narrower market shares?</h4><p>The ABL has always been keen on defending the interests of all its member banks, whether they are Lebanese or non-Lebanese, and small, medium, or large in size. We promote their activities at the domestic and international levels to secure their financing and open new spaces for opportunities to them. We also play an active role in coordinating banks' efforts on common interest issues. ABL continues as well to raise awareness of developments in regulatory compliance and to support small and medium banks through different means in configuring their compliance frameworks and implementing the necessary rules and processes. For example, we develop and distribute a set of generic policies and procedures manuals on business ethics and consumer protection, anti-bribery and corruption, international sanctions, and AML/CFT and FATCA to all our member banks. ABL also organizes different training activities related to various aspects of banks' activities, from battling money laundering to human capital training, and through these measures we guarantee a competitive and fair environment for all our member banks regardless of their size or capabilities. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The BSE has one of the lowest penetration rates in the region and is also one of the least diverse. How will privatization change this?</h4><p>The success of any stock exchange is in its depth and breadth. We do not have that today. We have not listed a company for the past 15 years since there is no excitement about it; the BSE is not dynamic, and the younger generations are unaware of the possibilities to list their companies. This trend happened mainly due to the outdated regulatory system we had and the small level of capitalization of the stock exchange, which deterred investors from coming. That is the reason why we gave priority to creating a proper regulatory framework that reflects a solid and promising system. On the supply side, we believe that there are many companies out there that can be attracted to the BSE and we have solid family businesses and great SMEs performing even at regional levels. Also on the supply side, there are a few government-owned entities such the Telecom Operators, Middle East Airlines, and the Casino Du Liban to name a few, that could create a major shift in the Capitalization of the BSE once listed. On the demand side, entities interested in bidding for ownership of the new exchange should be able to ensure the ability to become market makers. </p><h4>Many Lebanese companies are listed in foreign stock exchanges but are not traded in Lebanon. Is there a strategy to bring them back?</h4><p>This is exactly what we are trying to do. First, from a supply-side perspective, the number of active financial brokerage firms was limited, as there are certain barriers, one of them being the minimum capital required to license a financial intermediary, which is USD1.6 million for the lowest tier and goes up to USD5 million. Our new regulations have dissected the activities of capital markets into five categories: dealing, managing, advising, custody, and arranging. This move will reduce the minimum capital requirement from USD1.6 million to as little as USD100,000 depending on the category selected. We are confident that this will create an infrastructure of focused professional financial institutions that could help increase the appetite of local firms to trade and list on the BSE. I am also confident that this new procedure will attract many of the high-caliber Lebanese diaspora financial professionals to set up base back in the country.</p><h4>Most people look to commercial banks rather than the capital markets. Will an increase in the latter be detrimental to the activities of the former?</h4><p>We have a financial system that is purely debt-based. And while banks today have reached close to 100% of GDP in terms of lending, capital adequacy ratios are on the rise. As such, lending through banks will become more expensive and thus contribute negatively to the economy in the longer term. A viable source of accessing capital would have to be through the capital markets, therefore shifting the current financial system from a debt-based to a capital markets based system. As to whether a flourishing capital market is detrimental to banks, the answer is no, it is the banks themselves that are better positioned to champion such a shift in the system. </p><h4>Do you see privatization coming in a certain time frame?</h4><p>Seeing and hoping are two different things. We hope it will come soon, and we are close to that. I can firmly say the BSE will be subsequently privatized, so change is imminent. My guess is that it will happen within the next 12 months or even less. I am positive about the future of capital markets in the country; you have at one hand a solid regulator, banks, and financial institutions that are ready to play an active role in the capital markets, and companies that have so much to benefit. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the background of Fenicia Bank and how did your restructuring process contribute to a better identification within the Lebanese market?</h4><p>Fenicia Bank first started in 1959 as Bank of Kuwait and the Arab World. After the Civil War ended, I joined a group of Lebanese businessmen to acquire the bank in 1992. As we took over the bank, in 1992, we started the restructuring process through enhancing the management by injecting new expertise in the first and second line of management, we introduced new standard operational procedures to streamline all processes and set clearance on job descriptions and reporting channels at all levels. Equipped with a fully Lebanese workforce, in 2010 we made a major leap in changing the bank's headquarters, name, and logo in order to reflect our identity and our Lebanese roots. We also pushed the bank's assets, we succeeded to increase the bank's assets from USD10 million to USD1.5 billion, since we needed a solid platform to build on the new strategy we had planned. The challenge we faced in late 2000 was when we decided to compete with other mid-sized banks in Lebanon. We made it clear to our stakeholders that it was not our utmost endeavor to become one of the big players in the market, but to become the firmest and the strongest one. After the new management was implemented, we were able to achieve the best ratios in the market in terms of liquidity and return on equity; our shareholders have even been referred to as the happiest shareholders in the Lebanese banking sector. </p><h4>As a mid-size bank operating in the oversaturated Lebanese banking industry, how do you fare amidst the fierce local competition? </h4><p>We have a strong customer-oriented approach that allows us to know and understand the client's needs. This is our niche expertise to build a solid and long-term relationship with our clients, which enables us to attract new customers and enlarge our customer base. Part of our DNA is to offer prime and quality service rather than acquiring a lot of customers; in other words, our focus is to become stronger rather than bigger. We share our accomplishments with our clients because their success is our success as well. We concentrate our business on the conventional banking transactions, and we are actually competing with the top-five alpha banks in Lebanon in terms of service quality and prices, despite the fact that we are a medium-size bank. Moreover, we have always been highly capitalized as our board's direction demands. We play it safe and manage risks to mitigate their impact without sacrificing the satisfactory level of profit. This might seem to most players in the market as a moderate role; however, we have experienced success stories based on such strategy. </p><h4>The diaspora is one of Lebanon's major assets in terms of capital inflows. What channels do you use to attract them to Fenicia Bank? </h4><p>The majority of our shareholders are part of this Lebanese diaspora. As such, we understand our Lebanese expatriate needs and requirements. We maintain good and long-term relationships with eminent Lebanese businessmen abroad and this kind of relationships ordain wide and large channels to meet the requirements of  the Lebanese diaspora and reach out to their business fields, mainly in the GCC and western African countries where the Lebanese presence is vast. We have teams that regularly visit those countries and return with new relationships. We try to be next to the Lebanese expatriates side by side to help them meet their goals and succeed wherever they are. The diaspora trusts the Lebanese banking sector, because they are aware of the high caliber of the players here; they know we are accountable, compliant, and that we offer the best services in the market. Most banks in Lebanon are family owned, so this also plays in the favor of good accountability. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Confidence in the Lebanese economy and pound is relatively resilient despite a challenging external environment. What factors are behind this confidence?  </h4><p>Confidence in the Lebanese economy is threefold. First and foremost, exchange rate stability has been the anchor of financial stability in Lebanon since the late 1990s. This fact has been manifested in the systematic decrease of the dollarization rates of deposits and loans for the past two decades. Trust in the Lebanese pound is thus higher than ever and has in turn reinforced confidence in the economy as a whole. Second, the historical accumulation of a large stock of foreign currency assets has shielded the Lebanese economy against major political, security, and economic shocks. Banque du Liban's foreign assets increased from around USD3 billion in 1993 to around USD37 billion today, and this is not even including gold reserves, which at July 2016 market prices were estimated to be more than USD12 billion. Finally, the large remittances from the Lebanese diaspora have been the backbone of the Lebanese economy for several years. They have helped in adjusting sizable current account deficits and have supported the multiplication of bank deposits to the point where they represent three times the size of the Lebanese economy. According to the World Bank, total remittances were estimated at around USD7.2 billion in 2015, making Lebanon the 16th largest recipient of remittances globally and the second largest among Arab countries.</p><h4>Banque du Liban has been the main promoter of entrepreneurial activities in the knowledge-based economy. How would you assess the level of response to these initiatives and what are the prospects for this segment to become a flagship economic sector in the near future? </h4><p>The idea to inject money into this sector came about when we recognized the significance that the knowledge economy had and the potential it could bring to develop the national economy. In order to capitalize the sector, we decided to increase banks' investment possibilities in this sector from 3-4% coming out from their own capital. Three years on from the emission of Circular 331, we have seen tangible results through the growing number of startups attracted by and benefiting from this equity-financing scheme. To date, banks have committed more than USD300 million, with capital value of more than USD700 million. The ecosystem as a whole is systematically growing, increasing its ability to cater to the various types of sectors the knowledge economy is revolutionizing. Human capital has always been, and will remain, the main driver of the Lebanese economy, so our prospects for the future of the ecosystem are rather promising. Lebanon is effectively witnessing its highly qualified youth pushing the limits of innovation and creativity to the next level. The knowledge economy is thus undoubtedly one of the fundamental sources of inclusive growth for Lebanon's medium to long-term outlook, in addition to the financial and the oil and gas sectors. </p><h4>Banque du Liban recently launched a new circular to stimulate the real estate sector. How will this stimulus contribute to revitalizing the real estate industry? </h4><p>Until recently, the real estate sector was a rising star in the Lebanese economy with ambitious and extensive projects all across the territory. The economic complexities posed a threat to the industry and the sector lost its impetus, so in June 2016 we decided to issue Circular 427 with the aim of stimulating the real estate sector. This incentive scheme allows Lebanese banks and financial institutions to offer credit facilities of up to 60% to real estate companies, so they can acquire built properties with the purpose of selling them at a later stage, subject to specific conditions. This new scheme will not only benefit real estate developers, but the entire supply chain in this industry. By stimulating the sector we aim to increase our GDP. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been the biggest transformation for Level 5 Holding in the past two years?</h4><p>We moved forward with the Orchid Batroun 27,000sqm four-phase project to open new outlets in the hospitality sector. The first phase was a beach lounge opened in July 2015, while the second one an event and wedding venue prepared for June 2016. Left to finish over the next couple of years are the third phase, a restaurant cluster, and phase four, a chalet housing development for seasonal rent. In the retail sector, we are currently further boosting the presence and the market share of Eden Park and opening the fourth POS in ABC Verdun. Finally, our media division is still the backbone of our business and constitutes 80% of our operations. We have continued expanding in outdoor by acquiring a 4X3 network that we rebranded as Douze, and investing in LED screens within Beirut City. We also signed an exclusive agreement with prestigious French group Le Figaro, with which we had a representation agreement for the Levant and that we have taken to a higher level by representing it exclusively for all GCC countries, including its online arm, CCM Benchmark, which it acquired in November 2015. We finally signed a franchising agreement with Madame Figaro, France leading women's fashion and social magazine as a joint venture with Special Magazine for the Lebanese market.</p><h4>How has Lebanon's economic slowdown affected the advertisement industry?</h4><p>Advertising is the pulse of the economic activity and you can measure the economy of a country by checking its advertising health and status. Since the economic recession started in 2012, the turnover for advertisement in the country has dropped every year. An unfortunate part of our industry is that companies tend to difficult advertisement expenditures first, as it is easier than firing employees or cutting other expenses. The second major challenge is the awful payment periods that we are facing in the advertising industry, which have increased from about 45 days after invoicing when I started 24 years ago to typically 120-150 today, which presents a great challenge for the economic development of our business.</p><h4>Do you plan to take the French franchises you acquired in Lebanon to other countries in the Middle East?</h4><p>For the Eden Park brand we only plan to develop it in Lebanon. For Mauboussin, we acquired the franchise for the entire Middle East and faced some significant problems in Kuwait, which led us to close our store there. Although we are well established as a group in Lebanon, we do not have the capacity to open alone in the Middle East; hence, we need to partner with a strong partner there to be able to develop Mauboussin in the region. The experience in Kuwait showed us that we cannot go in alone with this concept and need the backing of someone with sufficient knowledge of the local markets in the GCC. Dubai and Saudi Arabia are definitely the most suitable platforms to expand in the Gulf.</p><h4>What impact will the plan to have full fiber-optic coverage by 2020 have on the local media and advertisement landscape? </h4><p>It will transform the entire media scene, starting with TV as we do not receive it through fiber optic as they do in Europe and the US. The cable operators will have to change their business model and it is going to be a major transformation in the audiovisual scene. The current boom of digital media is also threatening traditional media, who need to evolve and adapt or else face bankruptcy. I always give the example of Le Figaro, which was able to cope with the digital revolution and even increase its distribution and total reach through its various platforms. This is a fantastic way of going through these changes—identifying the audience we should aim our digital and print segments toward. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>AC Holding has moved into other sectors and industries. How has this shift strengthened your position in the Lebanese market?</h4><p>Our strategy has been to diversify our investments as much as possible and to reach as many markets as we can, so our results have magnified in a positive way. Some of the sectors we heavily invested in, such as the technology sector, have witnessed an oversaturation in many product lines, causing timid growth in the past years. This has prompted us to venture into new areas where there are more possibilities for growth and where we can play a more advantageous position. This move has signified great results for the company and we plan on moving forward with this strategy.</p><h4>How is this oversaturation in the IT sector pushing you to explore new areas?</h4><p>The business is moving from hardware to software and from devices to solutions; hence, we are investing in these two segments through cloud-based applications and hosting services, offering cloud-based software as well. The slowdown in economic activity and the shifts in the IT and technology sectors have pushed us to explore new markets that we otherwise would not have penetrated. The market is slowing down and that is why we look at different types of approach, mainly in hosting services.</p><h4>How is your business in the real estate sector currently faring?</h4><p>The real estate sector at the moment is going through complicated times. There is a slowdown impacting the entirety of the sector. The demand side is low and has shifted away from the middle- and high-end developments to smaller developments, but we remain cautious nevertheless, since we do not know how the market will evolve in the next year. That is why we only have one project at the moment, which will be delivered soon. We have kept working indirectly with most developers operating in the market through our commercial business in projects involving renewable energy and such, but that is about everything we are doing in the real estate sector at the moment.</p><h4>The central bank recently launched the NEEREA program to grant subsidized loans on energy projects. What have been the benefits of this program?</h4><p>There are many projects pushing for a wider use of renewable energies in the country, but NEEREA is definitely the one with the biggest exposure. We are approaching clients who have space for solar panels and we use the law enacted by parliament to connect them directly to the grid using a net metering system. We are also channeling these customers toward subsidized loans offered by the central bank through NEEREA, so they can benefit from an interest rate of 0% for the first two years. What makes this scheme even more attractive is that the total investment is recovered in a period of four or five years.</p><h4>What are your current plans for expansion outside of Lebanon?</h4><p>The holding's operations abroad account for 70% of our revenue. Right now, we consider Africa the place to be, particularly Ghana and Cí´te d'Ivoire, where we have expanded into various businesses, including the trading of commodities. In Ghana, we are present in the sports betting business with 100 licensed centers around the country. This is an interesting case because it is outside the scope of our regular business, but we have done extremely well so far. We also want to explore real estate, healthcare, and education in African countries. We are optimistic of what will happen in Syria once things get better and the reconstruction process starts. We have not left the Syrian market even during the conflict and are hopeful about the future. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you talk about some of the flagship real estate projects that Saradar has been involved in?</h4><p>We recently built the Abdel Wahab project, which will be delivered to clients, and we also have another big project in Gemmayzeh, which we are just starting and will be finished within two years. The three main projects will all be developed now in Lebanon and we have some other projects in the mountains as well, such as a real estate development project, which will be launched soon. We are also looking for opportunities in London and in the US, as well as income-generating projects elsewhere.</p><h4>Given the challenges faced by real estate in Lebanon, what is your vision for the sector at the moment?</h4><p>The sector has slowed down due to current events in the region and the economic uncertainty raised in Lebanon over the past few years; nevertheless, real estate is still interesting, as most players in the country have sufficient means to stay in the game without relying on private financing. The opportunities are still present, mostly outside of Beirut, and somehow are still stable and have positive margins. The trends are shifting toward smaller properties, and this is prompting important growth for small developments throughout the country where we are looking for opportunities to grow. Our expectation is that real estate will boom again shortly once the situation in the region gets better.</p><h4>Can you tell us about the recent merger between Near East Commercial Bank and Banque de l'Industrie et du Travail?</h4><p>When we acquired NECB, our ultimate goal was to create a medium-sized bank focused on offering a quality service capable of developing its own digital banking division. All major banks in Lebanon have formed extensive networks, and they have a strong presence in the market. However, we thought that there was a niche market to explore in digital banking to reach new clients, those who represent a new generation, and those who look for efficient banking solutions. On the private banking side, we expect to compete at the same level as large banks but offer better services and a better reporting system. We are currently changing the IT structure of our newly merged bank and we could not be more excited by what this new entity will bring to the financial sector in Lebanon.</p><h4>The banking sector in Lebanon is over-saturated, increasing competition. What is your strategy to remain competitive?<br></h4><p>Our advantage will probably be our size. Banks grew rapidly and became big for Lebanon, but they were not able to offer an equally good service to their clientele. They are mostly focused on high-end clients and leave a considerable portion of medium-sized clients unattended—that is the sector we are targeting. In the digital world, none of those banks have developed themselves, and we hear that other banks will be growing in that area, but there is nothing concrete thus far. Overall, our idea is to become a specialized bank with efficient services covering a wider range of clients.</p><h4>Where would you like to see the group growing in the future and what sectors are you interested in getting into?</h4><p>Today, we have reached all  the sectors we wanted to reach, and now we will focus on being a major player in each of them. We are strengthening our construction arm in real estate so that we will not only be developers but also contractors, as there is great potential in the eventual reconstruction process in places like Syria and Iraq. Internationally, we want to be more present in real estate and eventually in the financial sector in Africa, where we believe there is a great deal of potential for development. Our next step is to develop internationally in promising markets, and we are directing our efforts in that direction. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some recent highs and lows for Kafalat?</h4><p>Our profits had been declining steadily since 2011, and we lost nearly one-third of our business by mid 2015. However, 1Q2016 has seen a moderate pick up and the company has been able to make a profit, albeit less. Kafalat works on a solid base due to its extensive reserves, which give us the opportunity to take risks. Previously, the risks realized were extremely low, ranging between 1% and 1.1%. Lebanon has an old and savvy banking sector that has been through tough times and has always come out victorious, and Kafalat is a source of assurance that customers' investments will be rendered profitable with an overall equity-to-risk ratio of over 30%. Credibility is still high despite the rise in failures to close to 4% in the last year due to the local and regional crisis.</p><h4>Kafalat has played a key role in fostering SMEs and start-ups in Lebanon. What factors account for your crucial involvement in the market?</h4><p>We are a private financial company backed by the support of the National Institute for Guarantee of Deposits that uses part of its equity to participate in the funds we provide to start-ups and SMEs, this is in addition to the 46 commercial banks that are shareholders. Our guarantees are also financially supported by the EU and Banque du Liban, both of which subsidize the investment and the interest rate, allowing start-ups and SMEs to access cheap credit lines. In the past, we have also counted on the support of the World Bank and the Lebanese government. In addition, legislation has been adapted to ease investments from third parties according to their type, their funding limits, and their duration—three factors determined by the law itself.</p><h4>What is the business model used to strengthen the position of SMEs and startups?<br></h4><p>One of our core ideas is to accelerate the process of equity retention, modernize the companies' structure, and strengthen the processes of governance and transparency; therefore, our beneficiary companies are able to get equity easily and even be listed on any junior stock exchange. Kafalat Innovation has been working successfully since 2006; hence, we keep a close eye on it. We also focus on a co-equity program whereby 50% of the funding would come from us and 50% from the banking sector. This program was originally conceived five years ago and it only took effect on Christmas of 2014 after each party did their due diligence. Now, the program is taking off, and we can provide the applicant companies with seed capital. We have a loan guarantee for energy obtainable for small companies that want to modernize their structure or operations; we grant them guarantees higher than 85% through which they can lock up their equity in their own favor. In the case of ordinary loans, we allow them to go for a mortgage of up to 50% to maintain strictness in the guarantee. We have been able to accommodate different proposals according to their market potential in the four centers we have. In past years, we received several applications from people in Syria who formed partnerships with Lebanese startups and combine their talents to use our guarantees and loans. The complicated situation in Syria has not diminished the entrepreneurial spirit of businesspeople in Damascus or Aleppo who have joined forces with their Lebanese peers and started niche businesses.</p><h4>Where do you see Kafalat growing in the following years?</h4><p>We want to double the number of investments in order to raise the stability of our programs, reducing risks and increasing our participation in 50-50 schemes. We see great potential in creative sectors in Lebanon and want to continue fostering them. So far, Kafalat has been a great link between ideas and capital, and we aim for a considerable increase of the success stories we have helped develop over recent years. </p>]]></richbody0content>
