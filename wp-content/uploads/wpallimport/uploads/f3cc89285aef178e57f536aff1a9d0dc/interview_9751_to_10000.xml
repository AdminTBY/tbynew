		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role has Iran played in regional cooperation and development?</h4><p>The Islamic Republic of Iran attaches great importance to enhancing regional cooperation as an important means for the growth and development of countries in the region. The emergence of several regional cooperation entities like ECO, D-8, the Indian Ocean Rim Association for Regional Cooperation (IOR-ARC), and the Asia Cooperation Dialogue (ACD)—among others—are indeed important manifestations of the revival of interest in cooperation among interested countries. These organizations have significantly intensified their activities in the areas of transportation, communications, infrastructure, energy, investment, and trade. Cooperation among developing countries is not a new phenomenon. Regional cooperation constitutes an important feature of international economic cooperation in recent years. In the light of new realities and changing circumstances brought about with the end of the Cold War, globalization, and the independence among economies. Cooperation among countries of the region continues to be an integral part of the development process itself, and of international development cooperation. The emergence of new frameworks of multilateral trade cooperation, particularly in regional cooperation and integration, as well as the development of technologies in general—communications in particular—are some of the other important factors accelerating the interdependency of economies. Regional economic cooperation and integration is emerging as a central feature of the revival of interest in south-south cooperation. The strengthening of regional arrangements in a way that makes them operationally useful to their member countries are the major objectives of the cooperation between the countries of our region.</p><h4>The Islamic Republic held the 16th conference of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) in August 2012. What is the significance of your membership in NAM?</h4><p>After the victory of the Islamic Revolution, and on the basis of fundamental principles of “neither East nor West," the Islamic Republic of Iran joined NAM as its 88th member during the sixth summit meeting in Havana in 1979. Since its membership of NAM, Iran, as one of the active and pioneering countries, has always participated in all the summits and ministerial meetings, and it has played an active role in the process of decision making concerning important international issues. Over the last three decades, the Islamic Republic of Iran has already proven its commitments vis-í -vis the realization of the goals and objectives of the movement, and during this period my country has always been faithful to all the principles and objectives of the movement and has made significant efforts in line with defending the rights of developing countries and strengthening the solidarity among NAM members. Of course, everyone knows that for many years the Islamic Republic of Iran has been combating against certain attitudes in the international system that try to limit the freedom, independence, and progress of other countries. The proposal of the Islamic Republic of Iran to host the 16th summit meeting of NAM was presented during the 15th summit meeting in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. This was welcomed by all member states, proving the confidence of the members in the active and effective role of Iran for promoting and developing the goals and objectives of the movement. In fact, NAM has a great capacity and potential. More than two-thirds of the countries of the world are members of the movement. The decisions of the Movement can be very effective for maintaining peace, security, and justice in the world. Undoubtedly, the Islamic Republic of Iran, during its chairmanship over NAM, and as one of the members of the Movement, will make tremendous efforts in order to have an effective and efficient role in the international arena for increasing the credibility of the Movement and promoting the levels of cooperation among members on all economic, political, and cultural fields. We shall also make further efforts for the progress and development of all member states and the realization of the objectives of the Movement. Certainly, the decisions that were adopted during Tehran's NAM meeting with the motto “sustainable peace through joint global management," and particularly the use of effective initiatives by Iran while chairing NAM, shall all lead to the materialization of the lofty objectives of the Movement, and at the same time all the member states should try to further cooperate and create a new spirit in NAM.</p><h4>What value-added does Iran bring to the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC)?</h4><p>Enjoying a great geographical and demographical position, and thanks to its vast economic resources and independent political stances, the Islamic Republic of Iran has always been an integral and influential part of the OIC and its equations. My country has had an active participation in various meetings and discussions of the organization and has offered valuable initiatives and positions on issues including disarmament, terrorism, human rights, fighting Islamophobia, Islamic solidarity, the Palestinian problem, and other crises facing the Muslim world. The elevation and promotion of Islamic values is a vital objective, which is already incorporated in the statutes of the OIC, and Iran has left no stone unturned to this end. Moreover, Iran is one of the pioneers of the Islamic inter-parliamentary union and has been hosting its secretariat in Tehran. My country is one of the six major contributors to the OIC's annual budget and has actively participated in the meetings of the OIC Permanent Finance Committee, which is responsible for approving its budget and considering administrative and personnel-related issues.</p><div class="quote">“Regional economic cooperation and integration is emerging as a central feature of the revival of interest in south-south cooperation."</div><h4>How would you assess your strong ties with Russia and Latin American countries?</h4><p>Thanks to its development during the past two decades, Latin America has now turned into one of the world's leading political hubs. Despite challenges, the Latin American region has played an influential role in regional and international developments due to its spectacular cultural and economic capacity in the third millennium. The Latin American region has been witness to fundamental changes in political systems, which have resulted in the establishment of indigenous democracy and increased the role of the people. In view of this regional awakening, public uprisings have been formed in the region in line with justice-seeking causes, and the formation and strengthening of political parties with progressive inclinations. The average economic growth in Latin America stands at about 4.5%. This has, in part, protected the Latin American countries against the impacts of the global economic recession, providing them with the opportunity of improving relations with the outside world, and assuming a greater role in various regional and international developments. These are all distinctive features of the Latin American region, which are going to mark an era different from the bitter experiences of colonialism in the last century. New alliances and blocs have been formed in Latin America, especially over the past 10 years. The Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America (ALBA), UNASUR, Petrocaribe, and CELAC are a few that can be named. These formations have improved the status and trend of consolidation in Latin America as a major player in regional and international relations, which strengthened its position particularly around the axis of south-south cooperation. Regarding its economy, Latin America has turned over the past two decades into one of the important hubs of production and distribution of agricultural, industrial, and mineral products. Thanks to its open-door economic policies, Latin America has been able to turn from being a mere exporter of raw materials into a producer of semi-manufactured and final products to reach balanced economic growth—a development that can help materialize economic sustainability in this region. There is a huge potential on the one hand, and the large capacity of exports and reducing markets on the other, have encouraged the leaders in the region to resort to other parts of the world, other than the EU and the US, to develop exports and find non-traditional new markets. Therefore, consumer markets in the Persian Gulf, Central Asia, and the Caucasus have been brought to the limelight for Latin America. The Islamic Republic of  Iran, as a bridge between the Persian Gulf, the Sea of Oman, Central Asia, and the Caucasus, has provided an opportunity for Latin American countries to expand exports and realize their foreign commercial goals. The foreign policy of Iran is based on responding to the calls of independent nations and states for justice, independence, and righteousness. Political, cultural, and economic commonalities between Iran and Latin America, and their shared views in the necessity of introducing change in the current international political and economic systems, have forced the two sides to take steps toward expanding relations and exchanging technical knowledge and experience. Both Iran and Latin America believe in multilateralism, peacemaking, justice seeking, and the rejection of hegemony. We both believe in diversifying domestic patterns for development and in restructuring the non-constructive policies of international financial and monetary organizations. These are the similarities between the Islamic Republic of Iran and Latin America, which could help us play a more effective and constructive role in the new world order.</p><h4>How important are the efforts Iran is putting to ensure stability in Afghanistan?</h4><p>Afghanistan is an important member of the international community and its domestic circumstances deeply affect the security and the stability of the region. From this angle, every step is taken toward peace and security in Afghanistan. Not only is it considered as progress for the government and people of Afghanistan, but it is also a move toward regional and global peace, and the long-suffering and damage by insecurity and instability in the country. Iran considers any positive development in this regard as progress for regional security and its national security as well. In this regard, Iran has always actively participated in the regional and international arrangements and activities over the past decade on the reconstruction of Afghanistan. We have also formally declared our preparedness to host the Sixth Regional Economic Cooperation Conference on Afghanistan (RECCA). The financial contribution made the Islamic Republic of Iran to Afghanistan over the past decade amount to more than $500 million, including funds used for the execution of various infrastructure projects, such as the construction of 300 kilometers of roads and the 207-kilometer-long Khaf-Herat railway—a vital project that provides safe access for Afghanistan to international waters. It also funds different power and water supply projects, the construction of a specialized clinic in Kabul, the dispatch of educational advisors to Afghanistan, the admission of 600 students to Iranian universities on scholarship terms, the compilation of 400 curricula and text books for Afghan students, the provision of equipment for university libraries in five Afghan cities, and the presence of over 8,000 Afghan students in Iranian universities and over 300,000 Afghan students in Iranian schools. In addition, Iran has been host to over 3 million Afghan citizens over the past three decades and has borne huge costs for their settlement, food, medical treatment, education, and even employment. Iran is going to continue its financial assistance as well as its contributions to infrastructure projects in Afghanistan and will remain committed to all it pledges in this regard. Actually, we are presently involved in various major projects including the construction of a section of railway running from the Dugharum free-trade zone to Islam Ghale customs, building the fuel pipeline running along the Dugharun border market, the storage facilities of Islam Ghale customs, the completion of Phase IV of the Khaf-Herat railway, and the construction of the Chabhar-Zahidan railway, which if completed could bring about a landmark transformation in the Afghan economy by providing safe, easy access to international waters for the country. It is imperative for the international community to pay more attention than ever to the problem of Afghan refugees and make the necessary preparations for their return home as one of its priorities. On its course to reconstruction, Afghanistan needs specialized human resources, the governments, the UN agencies, and NGOs which have undertaken some commitments toward the Afghan refugees under the solutions strategy document drawn up between the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Iran, Pakistan, and Afghanistan for 2012 and 2013 are all required to fulfill their commitments. The Islamic Republic of Iran believes that the international community will be successful in its endeavors to help the Afghan economy grow and develop only when it can tackle the potential root causes and breeding grounds of insecurity in Afghanistan and help to restore peace and stability in the country. We do hope that with the end of the decade-long presence of outside military forces in Afghanistan, which has, unfortunately, eventuated in the entrenchment of terrorism and a surge in drug cultivation and trafficking, and with the removal of the foreign military bases in the country, we will witness the restoration of peace and stability in Afghanistan. It is also important to lay special emphasis on the responsibility of the Afghan government and civil societies, which represent different Afghan institutions and groups for the full restoration of peace and stability, and also for the enhancement of the development process in Afghanistan and ask the government to launch a more serious fight against terrorism, administrative corruption, drug trafficking, and involve all social and ethnic groups with varied political tendencies in the national reconciliation process. The Islamic Republic of Iran hopes to be able to take a major stride in the economic growth and development of Afghanistan in view of the political, security, and economic realities of this country and the whole region. We welcome boosting regional cooperation in order to contribute to the sustainable development of Afghanistan. It is a great honor to announce that the Islamic Republic of Iran was within the framework of good neighborly relations principles and in compliance with the commitments of the Tokyo and London conferences, is actively involved in various aspects of Afghanistan's reconstruction, and fulfilled its commitments on the country's reconstruction.</p><h4>How would you assess your cooperation with the countries of the Central Asian region in order to become a political and economic hub for the whole region?</h4><p>Iran and Central Asia have a very strong cultural and historical bond, which significantly facilitates our cultural and political cooperation. Religion, language, and history are the greatest factors that connect us. Geography also plays a great role. Iran is the most natural path for Central Asia to reach the rest of the world. Central Asian countries don't have access to international waters, and the shortest way to connect them is through Iran. That makes transit through Iran a major priority for all these countries. There are several projects underway that in the near future will drastically increase the volume of transit through Iran to Central Asia. The Iran-Turkmenistan-Kazakhstan railway project is a big project, currently in its final stages. Also, the agreement recently signed and ratified by five countries—Iran, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Oman, and Qatar—will establish an international transit corridor that will make for another possibility of cooperation between Iran, Central Asia, and the countries of the Persian Gulf. We are following other plans to include Afghanistan in this network, which will also increase the windows for Iran on Central Asia. All these efforts will be backed up by friendly relations between Iran and all Central Asian countries. Two decades after their independence, the five countries view Iran as a stable anchor in the region, and as a reliable partner.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the structural strengths and challenges of Iran's economy in 2012?<br></h4><p>The main economic challenges in Iran for 2012 are the financial and economical sanctions, fluctuations in foreign currency markets and limitations on transferring currency, inflation, a decline in investments and also in the industrial production of the world's economy, and unemployment. The strengths include an efficient, educated, and young population, high potential in new industries such as nanotechnology, and the high growth rate of academic ability, which can contribute to an economic jump, and enormous oil and gas reserves and the investments made for converting them into final and semi-final products with significant added value.<br></p><h4>What are the policies is the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) putting in place in order to curb the devaluation of the rial?</h4><p>According to Iran's monetary and banking law, conserving the value of the national currency is the duty of the CBI. In this regard, the CBI has taken several steps over the past few months, including better management of resources and the usage of foreign currency. It is also paying more attention to the managed floating exchange rates, while trying to decrease the gap between formal and informal market currency rates. It is leading economic liquidity to other asset markets by making modifications in the structure of interest rates and hedging bonds, and also making changes and adjustments in currency allocation with regard to the country's currency priorities. It is additionally focusing on domestic potential and transforming sanctions into growth opportunities by means of increasing banking supervision and reliance on internal resources and utilizing them.</p><h4>How is monetary policy supporting the country's development goals with respect to the 2025 Strategic Vision?</h4><p>While focusing on halting inflation and creating financial sustainability, as well as supporting investment and economic growth, the CBI is moving to successfully complete the goals of the 2025 Strategic Vision.</p><div class="quote">“The CBI is moving to successfully complete the goals of the 2025 Strategic Vision."</div><h4>The IMF has described the implementation of the Subsidy Reforms Plan, as well as value-added tax and structural reforms in the banking system as positive. How would you evaluate this statement, and what further steps are needed in order to facilitate Iranian economic growth?</h4><p>Implementing the targeted subsidy plan has slowed the consumption of subsidized goods, especially fuels, to a desirable extent. However, implementing this plan has caused inflation due to other factors, such as costs incurred due to sanctions, limitations on imports, the reduced profit margins of some manufacturers, and a decline in the competitiveness of industrial commodities for export. This creates a condition that makes it necessary to make some reviews and assessments in order to preserve the achievements of this plan. In that regard, until stable conditions are achieved and negative externalities resulting from these factors are decreased significantly, the next phase of this plan will be carried out with less severity or it will remain silent. In such circumstances, a deceleration in the implementation of the targeted subsidies plan in addition to a prioritization of manufacturing firms' issues will help to enhance economic growth.</p><h4>In July 2012, President Ahmadinejad stated that Iran “should cut its budget's reliance on oil." What implications will this strategy have on the Iranian economy?</h4><p>It is obvious that reducing the dependence of the budget on oil will have subsequent positive effects for the country. There's a lot of emphasis being put on this matter in the Five-Year Development Plan.</p><h4>What is the economic outlook of Iran for 2013? How does it compare to your experience in 2012?</h4><p>Iran's economic prospects in 2012 can be reviewed from different perspectives. And of course it depends on many implicit and explicit factors. For example, if financial and economic sanctions continue to intensify, taking into account the significant role of oil in Iran's economic financing, we will witness a decrease in oil income, currency reserves, and in turn fluctuations in foreign currency rates. However, the economy will be able to convert sanctions into opportunities and fulfill the historic motto regarding the independence of the economy and the budget from oil income. If this is to be done, it will require a great deal of national unity and independence. The people of Iran must expect to go through a transition period and be able to increase their savings and investments and be more frugal. In this regard, policy makers have to communicate their actions clearly with the people.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>“The days are over," US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declared “of having outsiders come and extract the wealth of Africa for themselves, leaving nothing or very little behind." She promised a focus on “partnership, not patronage" and “a model of sustainable partnership that adds value, rather than extracts it."</p><p>As head of the Export-Import Bank of the US, I am committed to making this happen by providing finance to companies here with sound business plans that partner with US exporters. We provide loans, guarantees, and credit insurance to people when these are not readily available from the private sector.</p><p>My visit in 2012 marked my second time in Mozambique. The first was when I was 15 years old, as a high school student on a cargo ship that docked in Maputo, which then went by its colonial name of Lourenço Marques. We only stayed long enough to offload and load cargo—then on to other African ports—but the sights and sounds of the docks and the city beyond were unforgettable. It was part of my early education about a world tied together and enriched by commerce, ambition, and hard work. I am still at it—working to tie the world together with economic development and trade. I visited Mozambique again to work with government officials and the business community to provide vital financing to help move Mozambique forward and continue building this economy.</p><div class="quote">“The US has long been the largest bilateral donor of aid to Moazambique."</div><p>The US has long been the largest bilateral donor of aid to Mozambique. It is now time to expand that and work with the commercial sector. That is where financing from the Ex-Im Bank can be supportive.</p><p>Our financing here has been modest so far, but we know that we can do much more. Since 2009, the bank's exposure in South Africa went from less than $50 million to more than $1.1 billion today. That kind of financial growth is possible here.</p><p>We see a country of young, ambitious people, growing in number and ready to learn new skills and work hard. We see abundant natural resources waiting to be developed. The strategic location and long coastline present many opportunities to grow and establish transportation hubs and corridors. This all provides a path to lasting prosperity, with Mozambicans both directing these efforts and benefiting from them.</p><p>Strong economic growth in Mozambique over the past decade—virtually the fastest non-oil growth rate in Africa—is a tribute to the improved productivity and economic management of the country.</p><p>Underscoring that new awareness was the business development conference held in Maputo in April, “Let's Do Business: US-Mozambique 2012," which attracted 46 US companies. They ranged from oil giants Anadarko and ExxonMobil to aircraft manufacturer Boeing and credit card company MasterCard, as well as the US-Mozambique Chamber of Commerce.</p><p>Recent discoveries of major new natural gas supplies off the northern coast are part of that progress. For example, Ex-Im Bank is in discussions with Anadarko about providing some of the necessary financing for its projects here such as socially responsible projects that include local partners and opportunities for technology transfer, job creation, and industrial development. Small businesses need to be a part of this, to create job growth, and to provide opportunities for people to move into the middle class.</p><p>We also meet with Mozambique Airlines (LAM) officials about how we can aid its expansion with Boeing aircraft to serve the growing demands of air travel for business and leisure within the country and the region. Probably the greatest financing needed is for infrastructure improvements such as LNG projects, hydroelectric facilities, coal mining, cargo systems, highway construction, or simply dependable electricity for homes, offices, and factories. All of them are necessary for Mozambicans to advance into the global middle class.</p><p>Ex-Im Bank has decades of experience in such infrastructure financing and partnerships with world-class engineering and construction companies. We know how to structure transactions so that as these improvements take shape and yield benefits to the entire country.</p><p>In other words, Ex-Im Bank is ready to forge new partnerships with Mozambicans for the mutual benefit of both countries. We are ready, as Secretary Clinton put it, for “partnership, not patronage."</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>With such a strong economy, what further measures are needed for Mozambique to be upgraded from its current B+ sovereign rating?<br></h4><p>What is needed is to provide full and accurate information to the rating agencies. We must explain what we are doing and be honest. For example, if you are interviewing people from the private sector and ask their opinion on credit, they will say that interest rate levels are not promoting growth, but they will not tell you about the reasons behind the high interest rates or what they can do to improve the investment climate. The rating agencies base their current assessment on the global recession. We have implemented a number of reforms since then, and I believe these will help.</p><h4>How would you characterize foreign investor interest in Mozambican sovereign bonds?</h4><p>The way to finance our current account deficit is either by issuing treasury bonds internally or externally, or through borrowing on concessional terms. The government performs a combination of internal and external borrowing. If you look at our budget deficit as a percentage of GDP after grants, it stands at 5%, which is a reasonable level for macroeconomic stability. If you associate this with a stable exchange rate and low inflation, you can see that there is still a window for foreign investors to come and invest.</p><h4>Is the creation of a sovereign wealth fund necessary as a mechanism to manage Mozambique's anticipated natural resources revenue boom?</h4><p>There are rumors about exchange rate appreciation and Dutch Disease, but we are ready to manage that situation. First of all, it is important to underline that we have a free-floating exchange regime. Second, we still have a current account deficit as well as mega projects in the process of investment, which means we are importing equipment from abroad. With the current account deficit, there is no reason for the appreciation of the local currency, but rather there is an argument for its depreciation. Dutch Disease can happen when you have a surplus and you want to appreciate your currency. In our view, an appreciation of the metical could damage other sectors, even if the mega projects continue to export. We are following the real exchange rate and observing the level that can keep the economy competitive. In 2010, we had abnormal depreciation. We reached a situation where $1 was MZN39 or MZN40. This depreciation resulted from the delay in the reimbursement of funds by donors. We are trying to achieve a level of equilibrium and, from our calculations, the balanced exchange rate is something around MZN29 per US dollar. So, at the moment, there is no risk of appreciation, even with the large gas and coal exports.</p><div class="quote">“We started a program in 2007 that establishes incentives for commercial banks intending to open branches in rural areas."</div><h4>What will your policies be to keep the metical stable in 2018, when gas exports begin?</h4><p>We will have to process some of the locally produced raw materials. For many years, we have been exporting all our commodities without processing them locally first. If you want to process resources locally, then you need to make a huge investment and import equipment. Suppose you want to process gas; you will need to liquefy it. This means you will have to import equipment first, and if you want to use the gas for energy then you need to have the necessary equipment. This means that the exchange rate will be an important variable. The assumption of appreciation is that you will have huge exports. However, what the development policy says is that some of these products will have to be processed locally, which entails importing equipment. The exchange rate will not be fixed. For example, you cannot develop industry without energy, but you can use the energy to develop the country. A fund can be seen as taking this export revenue and putting it in a foreign bank. You can use a bank for price stabilization and you can use the stabilization fund for this purpose. I do not expect appreciation to happen because the economy is moving forward. I believe the economy will be able to absorb any appreciation because part of the fund will be used for stabilization and the other part will be used for development. The development part of the fund is the absorption of the revenue, which can offset the eventual currency appreciation.</p><h4>One of the biggest problems for SMEs is their credit access capacity. How important is it to integrate microfinance into the financial system to develop Mozambique's economy?</h4><p>We are discussing with different partners about how we can make credit available for SMEs. We do not have a problem with the financing aspect, but rather with how to organize those who are interested in developing a business. You have to train these people in how to organize a company and how to make a project worthy of investment. The first stage is organization; the second stage is accessing credit. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce is allowing us to set up a program for SME development. We have introduced seven such programs for SMEs in the past. Once the companies have been trained, we can mobilize local resources. The third stage is that we can use resources from the international market. There is still a window for us to raise cheaper money from abroad, but first we have to organize the sector to use this kind of program.</p><h4>Only 22% of adults have a bank account in Mozambique. What are your goals to improve financial literacy and increase the banking rate?</h4><p>We are doing two things. First, we started a program in 2007 that establishes incentives for commercial banks intending to open branches in rural areas. For example, if a bank imports equipment for allocation to rural areas, it pays lower taxes. This incentive package was set up in coordination with the Ministry of Finance. The second incentive was in terms of reserve requirements. For example, a bank in a rural or remote area can use the cash that it has deposited with the Bank of Mozambique. This means the level of reserve requirements will remain lower. In 2007, commercial bank branches only covered 28 districts, and now the number has increased to 58 districts. In addition, with new mobile technology, we can make financial inclusion even more popular. We are using mobile providers to transfer money from one place to another. Today, there is a substantial increase in the amount of people that use this method to transfer money. Secondly, we also have a program to educate our population about different financial products offered by the commercial banks.</p><h4>What is the potential for additional foreign banks to enter the market?</h4><p>Mozambique is a huge country, and despite the achievements in terms of district coverage, we have 128 districts overall and not all of them have branches. There is an opportunity for a bank to establish operations in these areas. Certain banks only want to establish themselves in the capital city to make money through export and import intermediation; however, for us, the government is the key for developing infrastructure such as electricity, communications, roads, and so on. There is a huge potential in rural areas, especially in agriculture. There are farmers who would like to increase their area of production, but cannot because they are unable to access credit. Farmers are selling their crops, but they have no bank branch in which to deposit their money. The existing commercial banks are not enough to cover the country's needs. With mega projects, some banks are accessing external financing. The idea is that local commercial banks with a good capital base could be the intermediaries for mega projects. There are logistics for mega projects that need to be financed. The existing banks do not have enough capital to intermediate the import and export needs for mega projects. There are international investors involved in mega projects that would like to establish subsidiaries in our country to better serve their existing customers. By 2014, I believe we will see more foreign banks receiving licenses in Mozambique.</p><h4>What are the main structural challenges Mozambique faces economically in the next few years, and how will you tackle them?</h4><p>Training is the first challenge. We need skilled people. We are in a new era where we have to deal with gas, coal, and other minerals. Second, in our financial sector, we have to look at the capital base of the banking sector. The banks need to leverage their capital so that they can be relevant in this new era. Third is to monitor policy challenges; how can we organize ourselves to stave off Dutch Disease? Mega projects are more capital intensive, but are not necessarily labor intensive. SMEs are the key players in the creation of jobs and sustainable growth. We must combine mega projects with SMEs. In order to avoid a situation like that in the EU or the US, we must ensure that the banks are properly managed and the risks we take are in accordance with credit regulations.</p><h4>Do you foresee regulations accommodating foreign requests to diversify products in the financial sector?</h4><p>Yes, there are already some financial institutions contracted to learn a new approach on how to raise funds for the economy. I have spoken with the IFC and it is considering buying meticais. Changing the regulations is possible provided that we are not putting the financial sector in danger. With high inflation, investors will not invest in Mozambique, interest rates will increase, and those on a low income will become even poorer. Macroeconomic fundamentals must be preserved.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>To what extent has the rebranding of Barclays Bank Mozambique shaped the bank's current operations, efficiency, modernization, and profitability?</h4><p>The bank's rebranding was the beginning of a new journey for our business as we strive to ensure our alignment with the Barclays greater Africa strategy. The rebranding was characterized by investments in our workforce and systems, as well as a general harmonization with the wider group. This rebranding is geared toward an enhanced customer experience with the bank, leveraging the group's global credentials, tradition, experience, and expertise to deliver a seamless banking experience.</p><h4>What is the projected impact of Barclays Bank PLC's increased ownership from 55.5% to 62.3% of Barclays Bank Mozambique's principal shareholder Absa?</h4><p>The proposed transaction is an important step in realizing our shared goal to become the “go-to" bank in Africa. It also presents a unique opportunity to leverage the combined operations integrated model across the continent, while at the same time enhancing collaboration on product innovation. The transaction is expected to bring about an opportunity for a uniform customer experience across Africa, as we continue to prioritize service quality and the delivery of a broader range of products to customers in all of our chosen markets, including Mozambique.</p><h4>Does retail remain Barclays Bank Mozambique's chief focus?</h4><p>Retail has always been and continues to be a fundamental component of our service and product offering, and we are placing even more emphasis on our retail operations in the coming year. In particular, we will focus on our “Prestige" and “Premier" banking products. The bank is also placing additional emphasis on new branch locations, paying close attention to the design and refurbishing of our older branches, coupled with the introduction of alternative delivery channels and improved technology to deliver our products. Our corporate segment is also of fundamental importance, largely due to the significant growth of the Mozambican economy and banking sector. As a financial institution, we aim to cover all of the significant segments that contribute to the economy's growth and subsequently increase our business activity.</p><h4>What is the bank's strategy to increase retail banking and lines of credit products for SMEs?</h4><p>The SME sector is a growing segment that is becoming increasingly well established locally. We are investing in capabilities and competencies in this sector in order to effectively partner with customers and contribute to our clients' development.</p><h4>How would you characterize the bank's position in Mozambique's increasingly competitive financial sector, especially with regard to the corporate segment?</h4><p>Despite the increasing competitiveness of the local financial sector, Barclays still holds a considerable market share and is the fourth largest bank in the country. Barclays is the only bank in the local market with a truly global presence. Our short-term objective is to leverage this experience and capability to further enhance our relationships with multinational customers involved with large coal, oil, gas, and mining projects. We are confident that by being a global player in the market, we can optimize our global resources, develop international experience, and employ the necessary tools to deliver the value-added demanded by our customers. As a financial institution, we intend to get involved in every important project, which will enable us to become the “go-to" bank—not only in Mozambique, but in all of the markets in which we operate. We are improving our system as a way to take advantage of the country's development process and ensure that we capitalize on the ever-increasing number of business opportunities in the country.</p><h4>To what extent is Mozambique a key emerging regional player in the insurance market for international investment?</h4><p>We see Mozambique as an important market for insurance. Current penetration rates are low, and that presents an opportunity as the economy and awareness among potential customers grow. The group acquired a leading insurer, Global Alliance Seguros, in Mozambique in 2011. Together with the banking footprint, this alliance presents an exciting opportunity for the delivery of combined group products and services for our customers.</p><h4>Do Mozambican sovereign bonds present an attractive investment opportunity for both domestic and international investors?</h4><p>The global financial crisis has created an interesting dynamic for first-world governments, which continue to face declining incomes brought on by relatively stagnant or shrinking economies and higher expenditures as they try to keep their social and banking systems together. Fortunately for these governments, funding costs have declined materially as investors have sought refuge at the expense of return. The BRICs (including South Africa) have experienced similar substantial slowdowns as export markets have dried up and commodity prices remain benign. As a result, nominal bond returns have declined and risk has increased, leading investors to accept lower returns and the relative safety of low-yielding debt. Although African economies have suffered in the wake of the global financial crisis, economic growth levels have consistently remained above world averages. The economic growth in a number of African economies relates to rapid population growth, strong infrastructure development, and affordable labor. Ongoing interest demonstrated by global mining and energy giants also continues to be a material growth driver. The relatively mature funding markets, which are offering fairly high returns, have supported and will continue to support this growth. In terms of this trend, Mozambique has been a star performer, registering figures consistently ahead of its peers. Government funds are supplied by inward investment, donor funding, and export proceeds, which up to now has been sufficient. Local funding has been secured through a relatively small bond market. Against the backdrop of the crisis, Mozambican sovereign bonds have presented a secure investment with a decent return for both domestic and international investors. However, the local bond market has a few unique characteristics—currency bonds are in short supply, the secondary market is practically non-existent, and bonds have been issued with maturities of around five years, which may be too long for some foreign investors. The upside is that the bonds always offer a real rate of return regardless of inflation. The Ministry of Finance is considering the possibility of placing more emphasis on the structural management of government finances, fixed-rate issues, and primary dealerships. From our perspective, although yields are relatively low compared to historic levels, Mozambican sovereign bonds offer a strong investment alternative.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the Mozambican economy, and what does this signal for the future of Barclays in Mozambique?</h4><p>Mozambique is on the cusp of becoming the fastest-growing economy in Africa due to sizeable investment opportunities in natural resources such as gas, coal, agriculture, and fisheries. Barclays remains committed to Mozambique's success, and the bank recently underwent a recapitalization process in order to play a larger role in the country's growth story.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[aiming-for-the-top]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has BCI developed since its restructuring in 2007?<br></h4><p>Five years ago, the country's top-ranking bank occupied a 47% market share, while we had a 22% share of the market. At the moment, we are still in second place. However, the top-ranking bank currently has just 34% of the market, and BCI now has 30%, so the difference is narrowing. Naturally, our competitors are not sleeping—they are seeking to match our development. If we continue to make investments, offer services that local people demand, and serve SMEs, we are confident that we can become first in the market. I believe that we are already the best bank in terms of services. My shareholders are pressing us to be the top bank in Mozambique, and I think that it will be possible in the medium term.</p><h4>How do financial problems in Portugal affect BCI and its shareholders?</h4><p>Caixa Geral de Depósitos (CGD) is the biggest bank in Portugal, and it is a sovereign bank. That is a minor problem because it is the state bank and it owns 51% of our shares. The other bank in Portugal is BPI, an investment bank chaired by La Caxia from Spain, Itaú from Brazil, and now Isabel Dos Santos from Angola. They own 30% of BCI's shares. Of the other 19% of the shares, 18% is owned by INSITEC Group and 1% is owned by individual shareholders. In terms of how the situation in Portugal impacts us, for the entire five years we have been making important goals to make up for the fact that the shareholders do not invest fresh money; we are putting the money in. The unique condition is that the shareholders have to leave 75% of the dividends in Mozambique. With that money, we are banking in Mozambique. Therefore, we have not felt any impact from the situation in Europe. However, we are managing the bank bearing in mind that we do not have backup funds. As a result, we have to be prudent with our management.</p><h4>To what extent do you attribute the success of Mozambique's banking sector to sound regulations?</h4><p>The financial system is very well guided by the Bank of Mozambique. I consider the central bank of Mozambique one of the best in the region and one of the best in Africa. Historically, banks in the area have experienced some problems, which led the World Bank and the IMF forcing them to build a supervisory bank system. I believe that we have achieved a good system. We are very confident because we excellent good regulators, and we faction as a good advisor for the system.</p><div class="quote">“The IFC in the US told us that we have the best program for women in Mozambique."</div><h4>How is BCI working to increase the penetration of financial services in Mozambique?</h4><p>BCI is a private and commercial bank that encourages SMEs to grow. We are orienting the bank in terms of local necessities, building a variety of products that are tailored depending on the region. The country is very large and the people come from different backgrounds—residents in Maputo are very different from those in Nampula. We tailor our branch services according to region, whether the demand is related to agriculture or mining. We offer products suited for the local people and train employees for different regions. Normally, two or three of our people are from the same region, which helps the bank better serve local people. Our motto is “Eu sou daqui," which means “I am from here." We also involve local content in terms of advertising. We have 1,800 people at the company; only 12 are expatriates. However, this system is not easy—we heavily invest in training and travel so that we can learn about each of the regions. Currently, all of my directors except three are from Mozambique. They know what local people want and how we can serve them. I think that this makes a difference.</p><h4>With more than 70% of Mozambique's workforce in the agricultural sector, how is BCI aiming to penetrate the underserved SME market?</h4><p>More than 73% of people in Mozambique are living in rural areas dedicated to subsistence agriculture, and it is not easy to put these people in the banking system. For us, it is a cost. None of the commercial banks want to give credit to the agricultural sector because the risk is very high, the return is very slow, and the profit is very small. People from the agriculture sector cannot develop at the same pace as commercial interest rates, which are very high. However, we are the first bank in Mozambique to have experience in two or three specific projects with USAID, AFD, AICEP, and the Italian government. Five years ago, USAID told us that it wanted some help from commercial banks to support the agricultural sector for the production of crops such as cashews and tomatoes, for example. We told it that we would join the project under two conditions. One was to share the risk and present it to our shareholders. We took 50% of the risk and invested $20 million. Now in Nampula, the cashew sector is completely developed. We also have five or six factories for the production of cashew. Of the total $20 million, we only spent $500,000 on this project, which has been very successful. However, it is a risk and there are some problems. In my opinion, the government should create a development bank to play this role.</p><h4>What impact have BCI's partnerships with international finance development organizations made on Mozambique's finance sector?</h4><p>All of the programs with organizations such as USAID, the French Development Bank, and the IFC are dedicated to SMEs. We have one specific program with the IFC, which is for women who run SMEs. It has been a complete success. The IFC in the US told us that we have the best program for women in Mozambique. Unfortunately, there are still commercial issues, which are mainly interest-related. We have a specific program that supports women by training them, but the interest rate is high. Regardless, the BCI, the city, and the country believe in the program and this is why we continue to invest here. In addition, we are convincing the shareholders to invest more. We currently operate from 130 branches. Five years ago, we had 41 branches, with no specific credits for the bank. Now, we are number one in the country in terms of credit, and we issue cards to everyone. In addition, facilitating the credit card process for others to who follow our example, we are monitoring the system and training more people. On August 1, 2012, we launched a completely new innovation on the market—the possibility to transfer money from your account to anywhere else. The recipient of the money does not have to have an account with BCI. You send the money from your mobile, and as long as I receive the code I can go to the ATM and take out the money. We will be the first bank to do this in Mozambique, and it will benefit everyone—from an agriculture company in the interior of the country, to teachers and health workers located in the middle of the country where it is difficult to get their salary.</p><h4>What role do you think that these technological advances will have?</h4><p>There are two major issues we face when developing new technology, which are not associated with the technology itself. One is with electricity—in terms of quantity and quality—and another is with the level and quality of communications. When we install ATMs in the middle of the country, we do not have the comfort of energy from electricity companies. We have to put our own generators there. We do not have the comfort of communications technology from communications companies. We have to put our own small satellite there to guarantee that. We have all of these branches and ATMs but they are all online in the central systems. You cannot imagine the challenge it is to set up even one ATM. That is why some of our bank services are more costly.</p><h4>What is your portfolio of international companies that have already signed up with BCI?</h4><p>We received a few companies from our shareholders. I think that the services of BCI locally are attracting all companies from a variety of sectors. We have some international companies that work with other banks internationally, but work with us here because they appreciate our services. We also have some international institutions here working with us. However, the bank has a disadvantage when compared with other banks because we are not in every region of the world. One year after arriving in Mozambique, large organizations are looking to work with us; we are working now with Anadarko, Rio Tinto, and South African Breweries and others. BCI enjoys a good relationship with these big companies, and through them we are serving the company itself and its employees.</p><h4>What are BCI's chief targets for the medium term?</h4><p>We are currently drafting a plan for the next three years. We are focused on growth, which we want to be at least 20% per year. It is a challenge, but when I started this project at BCI, the shareholders told me that in the first three years there would be no bonus. The company would invest in the first three years, without expecting any profits. However, in the first year we duplicated the profits, seeing 50% growth. In the third year, we grew by 20%. I believe in this country, our banking system, and my people. I think that we have the best people in Mozambique working at the bank, with 82% of our workforce under 33 years old. The potential is enormous, albeit risky, but the next three years will be crucial, and we will continue to grow. The growth is based on the development of the retail bank, which relies on SMEs and individuals. When we started the program the company was composed of 10% retail and 90% corporate. Now, it is at 30% retail and individual and 70% companies. We want to reduce companies and make the ratio 50/50 to see profits increase.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the company's strategy in Mozambique?<br></h4><p>Ncondezi is focused on developing an integrated coal-fired power plant and mine near the town of Tete in Northern Mozambique. The project will be developed in phases of 300-MW units, with the first phase targeting power generation in 2017. There is a huge requirement for power in the region and in Mozambique in particular, which currently has the highest demand growth in southern Africa. This will be Mozambique's first coal-fired power station, turning its huge coal resources into energy to power the development of the country and increase electrification, which currently stands at only 20%. Over the long term, the project also has the potential to export thermal coal once the rail and port infrastructure is further developed.</p><h4>What is the current status of your exploration agreements with the Ministry of Natural Resources (MIREM)?</h4><p>We are in the process of converting our exploration agreement into a mining license. We completed the mine's definitive feasibility study in December 2012, which was the culmination of over two years of extensive work evaluating the project and this enabled us to submit our mining application to the MIREM. We are working closely with government on the conversion and, in the meantime, based on the work we completed between 2010 and 2011, we signed a Framework Agreement with MIREM. This agreement provides the framework for mutual cooperation between MIREM and the company in developing the project and is a precursor to the mining license, which will govern the mine's development, fiscal regime, and operations.</p><h4>How is Ncondezi tackling the associated challenges of transportation and infrastructure?</h4><p>Fortunately, the Ncondezi project—an integrated power plant and mine—is not dependent on rail and port infrastructure, which is developing more slowly than the coal industry anticipated. The first phase of our project is 100% focused on meeting current Mozambican demand. The power plant will be located 90 kilometers away from the northern grid, and we plan to use the current spare transmission capacity to supply around 270 MW to meet local demand. The remaining 30 MW will be used for the power station and mine.</p><div class="quote">“Tete has grown enormously over the past five years, predominantly due to the coking coal projects in the area."</div><h4>What level of investment are you expecting, and in what timeframe?</h4><p>We are looking to make a substantial investment in Mozambique of around $500 million over the next five years as we develop the first 300-MW phase of the integrated power plant and open-pit mine.</p><h4>Where are you anticipating the finance to come from?</h4><p>We are talking to a number of potential partners from around the world, such as Asia, Latin America, Europe and, of course, Africa to assist us with the development of this exciting project. These range from international banks to provide debt financing, independent power producers, coal miners, power generation companies, and EPC firms. Power plants are very reliable revenue generators so we are anticipating a higher level of debt financing than a typical mining project.</p><h4>How have you seen Tete develop since you have been here?</h4><p>Tete has grown enormously over the past five years, predominantly due to the coking coal projects in the area. There's been a huge influx of foreign labor and development and it is now a very buzzing and vibrant town.</p><h4>What are your chief targets for 2013?</h4><p>Our main objective this year is to progress the regulatory and commercial aspects of the project, such as the mining license, the power framework agreement, and the power purchase agreement. This will then enable us to start work on the detailed engineering and design of the project so we can complete project funding in 2014 and commence construction in 2015 in order to meet our target of power generation in 2017. It is a very exciting time for Ncondezi and we believe we have a great project that will bring real and tangible benefits to the whole country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>To what extent has the experience in operations at the Pande and Temane fields paved the future for onshore gas exploration in Mozambique?<br></h4><p>Our experience has shown that the conditions are in place for other projects to be developed in this field. Since 2000, we have explored and developed the production of a fairly robust project with no major problems. Our success signals to any investor that Mozambique has the conditions to develop a project of this magnitude or even larger. We are now expanding into another chapter of our success story.</p><h4>To what extent is the expansion underway?</h4><p>Our project is under an incorporated joint venture, where CMH owns 25% of the project, Sasol Petrol Temane (a subsidiary of the Sasol Group) holds 70%, and IFC has the remaining 5%. This partnership is being improved every day. We hold meetings to discuss any issues that have arisen during the project and how to overcome them. The initial production capacity in 2004 was 120 million gigajoules per annum, and in the last two years we have been expanding to increase the production capacity to 183 million gigajoules. The expansion was finished in June 2012, and we have significantly improved capacity to the point where we can now supply gas for additional projects. The project has been very successful in that sense. Success stories always come with challenges to face and milestones to achieve, and so far, so good.</p><h4>What impact will your expansion have in the medium term?</h4><p>Our financial year goes from July to June. The results show an increase in terms of profits to the shareholders, though those profits are not being translated into increases in dividends. This is a problem that we are facing, but it is due to the conditions of the financing we have from lenders. They have high levels of financial ratios to trigger the payment of dividends. In terms of operations, the trend is going upward for the next five years. Currently, we are negotiating new contracts to supply natural gas for power generation and other projects to increase gas consumption in the domestic market because most of our gas goes to South Africa. The demand is increasing and more projects requiring gas are appearing. Increased activity requires more gas, more exploration, and drilling more wells. To do that requires further funding, to increase proven reserves. The operator is always thinking ahead to increase capacity, but we have to work in stages.</p><h4>What role do international commercial banks or investors play?</h4><p>We are in negotiations with a number of international commercial banks, and we have reached a point where we can approach them. The company could not do this in the past because of our financial situation; we did not have a track record. Now our lenders believe in our management, and we have a good track record to approach commercial banks, too. When it comes to private investors, it is a bit complex. Our mandate does not allow us to have a foreigner investor as a shareholder at this point in time. We want to grow larger and add more profits, but we have to consider the timing, and the international arena is not at its best in terms of investments and financial products that we can use.</p><h4>What is your vision for CMH in the next five years?</h4><p>Our goal is to double our output and revenues. Of course, to be able to do that, we have to improve the production conditions. Once you are producing from the fields, the process becomes harder because costs increase. Gas is a business that depends on pressure—once the pressure in the field declines, increasing it drives up the cost of production. Our output must increase to be able to cover and maintain a certain level of profitability. We want to expand and increase the capacity of our technical staff so that they understand the business and increase the dividends of our shareholders. We do expect that by the end of 2013 we will be able to achieve these goals. The company is growing, but this progress is not reflected in the dividends to our shareholders. We expect improvement in terms of dividends to be paid to our shareholders in 2012, and that this trend will continue in the future.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role will solar energy play in meeting Mozambique's electricity and power needs, given that only 30% of the population has access to electricity, and only about 20% of that is from the national grid?<br></h4><p>Solar power is very quick to produce. It's also very expensive to extend the national network. Through solar power we can establish small grids throughout the country, as long as there are enough people who need this electricity and enough commercial activities that can be developed with it. Solar power is greener, it's sustainable, and, in the long term, it is cheaper than other sources of energy. What we want to achieve is rural electrification. Solar power is ideal for this because it has a simple installation procedure and the maintenance is very low. Solar power helps to develop small industries by bringing electricity to remote places not considered by distribution companies, because it is expensive to extend power lines.</p><h4>How has Martifer Solar tailored its expansion plans for Mozambique?</h4><p>We have been active in Mozambique since 2011. It is very important to look at the long-term view. Martifer Solar has always established solar parks and subsequently sold the energy to the national grid. Mozambique is the first country that Martifer has penetrated differently. We have begun with rural electrification supply for small businesses, and from there we are looking to increase our foothold and to establish ourselves to supply larger, more well-known companies. Our setup enables us to supply anyone regardless of their electricity needs. Most of the companies in the north of the country use generators because they want stable power, and they do not always have access to electricity from the grid. Martifer Solar can come and help those companies produce their own energy supplies, go green, and gain access to cheaper energy.</p><h4>What is the appetite for solar power in Mozambique, and how do you intend to increase it?</h4><p>The appetite is not that big, simply because there is a lack of knowledge. We are currently working on spreading the knowledge about the advantages of solar power to the general public. One of our strategies is to approach people that have the knowledge, have access to markets, and access to decision makers in Mozambique to electrify their own houses and their farms. As soon as they are on board, they can talk to the others about it and perform PR for us by word of mouth. We already have interest from the Maputo Municipality, which wants to use our solar panels to power the new streetlights of the Maputo-Catembe Bridge. We would also like to increase awareness with homeowners who have large gardens and swimming pools, all of which remain lit throughout the night.</p><div class="quote">“We are working on increasing market awareness in Cabo Delgado, where the gas companies are."</div><h4>How are you targeting international companies that are coming in to invest in the assembly line?</h4><p>We are targeting large companies. However, many of the major factories and companies are already backed up with seven or eight generators. It is very difficult to sell solar panels to someone that already has generators producing enough energy to power a small city. However, we are not giving up. We are working on increasing market awareness in Cabo Delgado, where the gas companies are, especially since they have lots of offshore platforms. For them, the only feasible power source will be solar, and through the development of these partnerships we will also be able to power their onshore infrastructure. Nacala will be a logistical hub for the coal companies in a few years, and we want to position ourselves there as well and target big companies. One strategy that we are working on is to establish a renewable energy association in Mozambique to lobby the government as well as industry. We need to gain more exposure about renewable energy. The government is not helping us because it has other priorities at the moment. We need to position ourselves correctly in order to gain support from large companies, as well as to continue with our own strategic plan.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[pillars-of-development]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>It is with renewed pleasure that we have the opportunity to discuss questions regarding the development of the energy supply industry in our country and the overall African continent. This is a relevant and current subject. After all, energy is one of the pillars of economic and social development in any country.</p><p>Mozambique is definitely among the countries that offer the most favorable environments, from an institutional and a legal point of view, as well as in business-opportunity terms. The government maintains a steady commitment to always improve this business environment, and continues to deserve preference as a privileged destination for investments from the public or private sectors or even public-private partnerships (PPP).</p><p>In this regard, I would like to point out that in the last two years we have had the privilege of hosting the African Conference of Ministers of Energy (CEMA), a central organ of continental coordination for energy policies that, since its creation, has played an important role as a platform of experience sharing and support for our governments' efforts to strengthen and complement the initiatives of regional cooperation. Additionally, it lends a common voice to the political dialogue surrounding energy development in Africa.</p><div class="quote">“Mozambique is definitely among the countries that offer the most favorable environments, from an institutional point of view."</div><p>Effectively, the Declaration of Maputo, adopted by CEMA during a session held in November 2010, emphasizes a number of priority actions. Firstly, it stresses the urgent necessity to develop and strengthen national, regional, and continental strategies for the development of sustainable energy supplies through the diversification of a variety of energy resources available across the continent. Secondly, our will is to promote renewable energies in a joint effort to decrease the effects of greenhouse gases and search for solutions for all questions related to climate change, with technical and financial support from emerging economies.</p><p>The development and utilization of energy resources demands large investments to build the required physical infrastructure with particular reference to dams and respective transportation links to get the resources to consumer centers.</p><p>All of this constitutes a great challenge that requires resources on a scale that, for the majority of African countries, goes beyond the capacity of public funding. In this perspective, PPP shows itself as one of the options for the materialization of ventures of this magnitude.</p><p>We are delighted that Mozambique is cited as a reference example on the creation and maintenance of an atmosphere of peace and political stability, which has allowed the consolidation of an attractive environment for investment, including projects of large dimensions. Some examples of those projects include Mozal, the Cahora Bassa hydroelectric dam, Pande and Temane's natural gas, coal from Moatize and Benga, Ncondezi, and Jindal.</p><p>These political and economic factors sustain themselves in an auspicious institutional and legal framework that includes modern legislation, such as a clear definition of institutions' competencies, namely in the definition of policies, regulations, and implementation.</p><p>The pace of economic and social development that the country has been seeing over the past years reflects the increase in energy demand for such economic activities as the realization of public development programs, for the expansion of energy access to an increasing number of Mozambicans. Energy demand has increased over recent years by an average of 12% a year, corresponding to more than 80 MW.</p><p>The economic recovery, already a reality, allows us to anticipate positive trends toward the realization of investments aimed at meeting the needs of energy-intensive sectors.</p><p>Currently, Mozambique has many projects under development, the conclusion of which will substantially contribute to an increase of energy availability for major projects around the country, including Cahora Bassa (1,245 MW), Mphanda Nkuwa (1,500 MW phase I and 900 MW phase II), Boroma (200 MW), Lupata (600 MW), and e Lurio (120 MW) among others.</p><p>The majority of these projects are situated in the Zambezi River Valley, a reason why the Tete—Maputo energy transportation corridor project, also known as Dorsal Spine, is under construction. This infrastructure will allow for the energy produced in the region to flow to large consumers at the domestic level, as well as to the regional market. The development of the energy sector cannot depend only on one type of resource, even if it is abundant. In Mozambique's case, this means that, besides hydro resources, other existing resources must be utilized as well, such as coal and natural gas.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As a UK-based company with Australian offices, how did Baobab Resources begin operations in Mozambique six years ago?</h4><p>Baobab's founding director, Jon Crowe, has worked around southern Africa since the early 1990s. He was first introduced to Mozambique in 2005 and immediately recognized that it was home to the same highly prospective geological terrain that had been successfully explored and exploited in neighboring countries, and yet had received no modern exploration in country. Not too many companies had picked up on Mozambique back then, and this gave Jon a significant first-mover advantage in acquiring a large package of predominantly greenfield exploration ground with which we listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) in 2007. Baobab's initial exploration effort was centered around a decommissioned copper and gold mine in Manica province, where research led to the discovery of roughly 3 million tons at 1.5% copper, open at depth and along strike. At the same time, the technical team was running a program of rapid assessment over the other licenses, with those not meeting certain criteria being dropped. It was during this process that the company recognized the significant iron ore potential immediately adjacent to the mega coal deposits of Tete province. We knew that the iron ore project was a company maker, and Baobab has since focused the bulk of its time and capital on developing the project's potential. The International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group, also recognized the potential and Baobab partnered up with its officials at both the corporate level and project level in 2008. IFC has a 15% participatory interest in the Tete project and is the company's second largest shareholder after the African Mineral Exploration and Development Fund.</p><p>The first drill hole in the Tete project area was collared in March 2009, and the company has since completed some 80,000 meters of drilling that has defined a global resource inventory of 725 million tons of 35% iron ore, half a billion tons of which underlies a very small footprint of just 2.5 square kilometers. Our 2011 scoping study underlined the commercial merits of a vertically integrated mine-mouth smelting operation for added-value pig iron, which fully exploited the project's unique and strategic access to core iron and steel-making commodities. The company commenced a pre-feasibility study in 2012, which is rapidly nearing completion.</p><p>Baobab operates in Mozambique through its wholly owned subsidiary, Capitol Resources lda, with a technical office in Tete and a staff of approximately 60 personnel, of which three are expatriates. I moved to Maputo in order to open the in-country head office and get closer to the action. We still run a four-man office in Perth, which facilitates the corporate administration as well as technical data management. Our consultants are based in southern Africa, Australia, and Europe.</p><h4>Why is the Tete pig-iron project unique and of national significance?</h4><p>Pig iron is classified as a raw material that is derived from the intermediate smelting of iron ore, often utilizing low-grade thermal coal. It is used along side scrap iron to generate steel products, and has seen an appreciable strengthening in its market fundamentals over the past decade. With any value-added product, you need to be in the right place, and when it comes to iron and steel production, Tete couldn't be better positioned. Steel mills are almost invariably on the coast because it is necessary to bring together the key iron and steel making commodities of iron ore, coal, power, and water. In Tete, we are at the strategic confluence of these resources; Baobab's Tete iron ore project is flanked by some of the largest coal deposits on the planet and is downstream from southern Africa's largest source of hydroelectric power. This unique geological and geographical setting allows us to add a significant amount of value in country through the development of a vertically integrated mine-mouth pig iron smelting industry. The 725-million-ton resource base is sufficient to underpin not just a world-class operation, but potentially world-first and at first-quartile production costs. The single largest producer of pig iron globally is Tulachermet OJSC in Russia at 2.5 million tons per annum; our pre-feasibility study is examining production scenarios of up to 4 million tons per annum. Baobab anticipates an FOB cost of production of less than $225 per ton. This compares very favorably to the estimated $385-per-ton cost of production in Brazil. One of the key drivers to this very competitive cost of production in Tete is local access to non-export quality thermal coal being produced as a medium-grade byproduct by companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale, which are facing environmental issues for stockpiling it. A staggeringly low average strip ratio, of just 0.4 over the first 10 or more years of mining also helps drive down operating costs. The Tete project will be producing a large vanadium byproduct that will further strengthen revenue streams and open up opportunities for additional refining options. The production of higher-value, higher-demand pig iron mitigates port, rail, and freight requirements. With an iron content of more than 95%, pig iron is one of the most efficient forms, both commercially and environmentally, of moving iron units around the planet.</p><h4>How do you negotiate the logistics challenge?</h4><p>Mozambique certainly has infrastructure hurdles that challenge investment. However, these will be overcome. The Tete region, with its potential to corner 20% of the world's seaborne coking coal market, is emerging as a mining and industrial hub of global significance. We require power, port, and rail allocations for the initial treatment and export of up to 2 million tons of pig iron per annum by 2016, when we are slated to be in production. We are in discussions with CFM about access on the Sena line to Beira and Vale about access on its Nacala Corridor expansion. Beira is not an ideal port for coal producers—its draught prevents the effective loading of Panamax-sized vessels, and Cape-size vessels can get nowhere near the coast—but is ideal for our Handimax vessel requirements. Nacala is eastern Africa's premier deepwater port and Vale's 30 million ton per annum railway should be commissioned by 2015. Of the 30 million tons, 12 million will be open to third parties, which is in line with the government's mandate on third-party access. Access to power is also fundamental to the project's development. Again, we are talking to both the government and private sector. Ideally we would draw low-cost hydro-power from the Cahora Bassa grid, with plans in place to expand the hydro capacity on the Zambezi River from roughly 2,000 MW to close to 5,000 MW. There should be plenty of availability. Ncondezi, Rio Tinto, and Vale are all looking at thermal power options and we will be negotiating with them on potential off-take structures. The good news is that the Ministry of Natural Resources is very supportive and is backing us in discussions with the other government ministries and para-statal institutions.</p><h4>Besides Tete, you have three other exciting projects. What are you anticipating over the medium term?</h4><p>We are eager to begin our Muande magnetite and phosphate project. Muande is a great example of why exploring in Mozambique is key; the deposit is located within 3 kilometers of the international highway and power transmission, within 50 kilometers of the rail head at Moatize, has been the focus of extensive exploration programs conducted in the early 1980s, including some 3,000 meters of drilling and 15 kilometers of trenching, and yet has not been walked over in a quarter of a century. So far, we have earned a 60% stake in the project, and we still have a lot of work ahead to prove up the value. However, the opportunity here is for three product streams: a direct shipping ore (DSO) overburden grading up to 64% iron mined during the pre-strip, followed by the main hard-rock mining and processing operation, which would constitute two product streams. One is a primary high-specification, low-impurity magnetite concentrate for export, and the other a phosphate rock concentrate byproduct that could potentially be sold directly to the local fertilizer industry. The percentage of arable land in Mozambique that is fallow is huge; it could be the breadbasket of southern Africa, and the country has huge export potential. The other commodity we are exploring is calcium carbonate, which is used in cement and clean coal technology.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How significant is Jindal's role in supporting local infrastructure development?<br></h4><p>As an investor, we do not want to isolate our participation in the field of infrastructure development. Our intention is to support the coal industry so that we can earn money from steel. We look at infrastructure development as an opportunity to maintain the segment of our business lending support to steel operations. If we decide to build a port to facilitate exports, for example, the options are there. What is important is that the government has already started working on these challenges; it is finding that the best way is a multi-user port. We have already invested in coalmines, and we are going to invest in infrastructure development under Mozambican guidelines with an open-access approach. We are still doing a feasibility study in close cooperation with the government of Mozambique for the development of a new rail line along the coast, as well as the construction of a new railway in the north. Some of these lines are already complete.</p><h4>What is the timeframe to begin work on the supportive infrastructure development?</h4><p>The timeline we are looking at over the next three to four years is to have sufficient infrastructure to support the production of close to 40 million to 50 million tons of coal. I believe that Mozambique's potential of exporting up to 100 million tons of coal will not be very far away. I think that over the span of 8 to 10 years it is possible. What is most important is to do the homework. Once you do the proper homework, the actual investment will not take much time.</p><h4>What level of capacity will the line have to support Jindal?</h4><p>Partnership is always welcome with the government in infrastructure development. Our intention in investing in infrastructure is to facilitate coal exports. At present, we do not have any distinction on the production side. We have a production plan for 10 million tons of capacity, which we are going to start in 2012. We started with 3 million tons and then we are going to ramp that up to 10 million tons. However, this capacity is not because of the new reserves or the resources, it is only because of what the infrastructure can now support. If the infrastructure can support it, we could facilitate up to 20 million tons.</p><div class="quote">“We are aiming to export our first coal by the end of 2012, and ramp up in three to four years to a capacity of 3 million tons."</div><h4>In terms of the thermal power plant (TPP), to what extent is it necessary to build one?</h4><p>As far as Jindal is concerned, making steel and generating power are our core businesses. Our intentions when coming into Mozambique were to harness the coal and other resources here. Utilizing those resources has its difficulties, but it is possible. The idea is to use the coking coal for our steel plant. We also want to export high-quality thermal coal as well, but because of infrastructure constraints, there are certain limitations. The cost to transport coal will not make the project viable. So, to make the project more viable one has to use the coal in two ways, instead of transporting it we have decided to have a power plant here as one of our core businesses. When talking about coking coal, which is being used for the making of steel, then costs can be constrained for now. To make the project more viable, our studies show we must build a power plant. We have carried out research, and we have already signed a framework agreement with the government of Mozambique detailing what is going on. When everything is feasible, we will declare our intention to set up the power plant.</p><h4>What level of exports are you targeting for end-2012?</h4><p>We are aiming to export our first coal by the end of 2012, and the ramp up will be in three to four years to a capacity of 3 million tons. At the same time, infrastructure development is happening now, which will encourage us to increase the capacity from 10 million to 20 million tons.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Where does Kenmare Resources stand in regards to the pricing of titanium oxides, and what is your outlook for export prices?<br></h4><p>In the medium term there is certainly a supply deficit, and to some extent that deficit depends on demand as well as certain assumptions made about worldwide growth. We are quite bullish that the price will maintain itself at similar levels to what we are seeing at the moment, certainly in the medium term. It was on that basis that in 2010 we started our 50% expansion plan, which we are due to commission toward the end of 2012. When the financial crisis began in 2008, a lot of supply left the market. It has not come back into the market, hence the high prices at the moment. We cannot look beyond the medium term, but we believe that prices will stabilize over the coming years.</p><h4>Where are your main export destinations?</h4><p>In Phase I, the zircon was mainly exported to the EU, and the ilmenite to the US, with about 22% exported to China as well. The majority of the expanded production is to be marketed throughout Asia. We also export to Central America and Mexico.</p><h4>What challenges have you faced in the run-up to the commissioning of the mine?</h4><p>We have experienced a few delays; some equipment that we call “strong backs" was incorrectly manufactured, meaning we had to carry out on-site repairs. We currently expect to commission the mine by the end of 2012. There are always challenges; we are in a very remote part of Mozambique, and transporting equipment is very difficult. We have to do beach landings; we charter vessels from South Africa to ship the material, we then transfer the material offshore onto barges and bring it onshore by landing the equipment on the beach. Inevitably, much of the cargo also has to come by road; we are a long way from the purchasing center, so there are always difficulties connected to that.</p><h4>How have you been able to secure financing?</h4><p>It was difficult because at the time, Kenmare Resources had absolutely no balance sheet and we were trying to get people to invest; not only in a country that had just come out of a war, but in a very remote part of that country. That was why we had to resort to development finance institutions. We finalized loan agreements with the European Investment Bank (EIB), the African Development bank, FMO of the Netherlands, Germany's KfW, the Emerging Africa Infrastructure Fund (EAIF), and Absa Bank of South Africa. Kenmare Resources needed to raise $70 million in capital from its shareholders. Further funds have been raised and invested since then and when the Phase II expansion is concluded the total investment will be approximately $850 million.</p><h4>What production capacity are you expecting once everything is up and running?</h4><p>The mine will produce 1.2 million tons of ilmenite and about 75,000 tons of zircon. We are doing a feasibility study for a Phase III expansion, and that would be based on the concession that we had looked at upon first starting activities in Mozambique. Our current mining concession goes until 2029, but it is renewable. We have enough deposits for more than 100 years at current mining rates.</p><h4>Where will Kenmare Resources stand in terms of world suppliers of titanium derivatives in the medium term?</h4><p>When the expansion comes online, we will have about 10% of the world ilmenite market and 6% of the zircon market. Clearly, over the next three or four years, there will be some new entrants, but there are also projects that are nearing the end of their economic life. I would imagine that we will maintain that market share, and depending on the results of Phase III studies, we will be looking to increase it.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your main priorities in transforming Mozambique's transport infrastructure?<br></h4><p>The current transport infrastructure in Mozambique comes from colonial times. The Portuguese and the British colonial administrations used Mozambique as a service economy and gateway to Britain's nearby colonies. Therefore, all the infrastructure was designed with an East-West orientation. That was good, except it didn't do much for the country, which has a predominantly North-South orientation. Throughout the world, in terms of modes of transport and not considering air, sea is the best method, followed by rail, then road. In Mozambique, it was historically the other way around; road first, rail second, and sea third. The whole strategy is to change this setup, especially considering Mozambique is a long and coastal country. Roads will also serve to connect the rail to the sea in an East-West orientation. The presence of mineral resources has helped us shift priorities. Priority number one is to finish the Sena line, which is the shortest distance between the coal mines of central Mozambique and the Port of Beira. Priority number two is a new railway, called Macuse, which will come from Moatize to a new port in Zambézia province—the exact location is still being determined. The third priority is for a railway to connect the country to Botswana via Zimbabwe for coal export purposes. Then we have two more lines, one going to Nacala Port through Malawi and another one to Nacala that remains in Mozambique. The main ports in our country are Beira, Maputo, Tete, and Nacala. A new North-South line is going to be built in pieces, in order to take advantage of the locations of coal reserves. In five years, I would like to see 3,000 kilometers of railway operating. If we don't have everything running we will lose valuable investments from foreign companies.</p><h4>Where are you targeting the $500 million that you spend annually upgrading Mozambique's transport infrastructure?</h4><p>That $500 million has been spent mainly on two main ports, Maputo and Beira. In Maputo, it was for dredging the channel, building new terminals, and expanding the existing ones. In Beira, it was also spent on dredging and building coal terminals. One of them is finished, and now we are working on the second one. Some of the $500 million investment also went toward our airports, which are not driven by coal but  by tourism. We are revamping most of our airports and modernizing the infrastructure. We finished Vilankulo first, which is a tourist area, and now we are finishing up Maputo. We have also been doing some reconstruction in Beira, Quelimane, Nampula, and Tete. We're going to start work on Nacala Airport, and in 2013 we will start to build two new airports, one in Pemba and one in Tete.</p><h4>How are you working with private entities?</h4><p>Most of our projects are carried out in partnership with private entities. They put most of the money in, then operate and manage the projects. This is the case in Quelimane, Beira, and Nacala. We have just finished negotiating with Vale regarding the railway line from Tete to Nacala through Malawi. Negotiations are starting with a Chinese consortium and a Kazakhstani group on further projects. Most projects operate under a public-private partnership (PPP) model, except for the airports, for which we borrow and then construct.</p><h4>To what extent is Mozambique important to the Southern African Development Community (SADC) in providing transportation and access for its landlocked neighbors?</h4><p>Mozambique is one of the founding members of the SADC, and we have been involved with it for many years. We are also a signatory of the Almaty Declaration, which obliges countries like ours to serve as a gateway for imports and exports to and from landlocked countries. In addition to that, we are discussing a huge agenda in terms of regional economic integration. One of the fundamental aspects of regional integration is the movement of goods and people across borders, and for that, this country is of significant importance. The huge infrastructure program for African development has gone way beyond the SADC to East Africa. A railway connecting Cairo to South Africa is also being planned, and Mozambique will also be connected to it.</p><h4>What has been the impact of the Maputo Corridor on the potential for an increasingly favorable investment climate for Mozambique?</h4><p>The Maputo Corridor was one of the first such corridors, and it was developed purely on a PPP basis. We started planning it in 1986, and five years later we had about $2 billion. Now, we have about $4 billion or $5 billion including energy, highways, railways, and border crossings. The scoping exercise was done under the SADC context, until we discovered coal. First, we thought we had 3 million tons, then realized it was 12 million tons and later revised that to 100 million tons. It is thus a significant corridor.</p><h4>What is the current status of the Northern Development Corridor from Tete to Nacala?</h4><p>Building is underway to rehabilitate this corridor. There is currently a study being conducted by a Japanese group on the old port because it needs to be modified to provide more space for other commodities such as those from the agriculture sector. At the same time, there are studies on the ground to build an airport in Nacala, too. In the near future, Nacala is set to surpass Tete as an air transport hub.</p><h4>The laws to negotiate on behalf of the government for port concessions have recently changed. How will this directly change the way that concessions are made for ports in Mozambique?</h4><p>These are simply new elements in the old way of carrying out concessions. First, we aim to promote social inclusion, and second, the transfer of technology. This is something that has proven challenging in the past, since the logistical operators see the infrastructure as being more efficient if it is dedicated to one commodity. However, they have to accommodate other users. We finished a round of negotiations with Vale, which ended up being a success, and now it is training a large number of people.</p><h4>How are you expecting the value-added of this deal to manifest itself?</h4><p>This is not within the concession contract, as such. It is, instead, a part of government policy as a whole. We do have a vision, but we don't impose it on anyone, although we do encourage it. We have a project to build an iron smelter in Nacala. That will encourage the processing of iron ore and coal as well. We are also putting together a strategy to generate electricity. We envisage incentivizing value-added production. In Phase I, we will obtain the raw materials, and then Phase II is the processing phase. The challenge in terms of processing is that you need to have more than one raw material in order to make processing viable. We are not at that stage yet, but we will reach it.</p><h4>What levels of investment are you looking at to rehabilitate the airports?</h4><p>We are looking at around $1.5 billion in total. That includes building new airports as well as lengthening runways and modernizing airport terminals. This investment only covers large airports. We have many smaller airstrips throughout the country that are not covered by this plan.</p><h4>In terms of the vision for transport policy, what role will aviation play in the future?</h4><p>Aviation will drive development not just with regard to businesses but people as well, as they need a safe way to travel quickly. It can take up to three hours to fly from the north of the country to the south. Aviation will also promote tourism, as airlines are a marketing medium and connect the whole tourism development chain.</p><h4>With these new airports and increased capacity, what sort of opportunities are there for private investors within the aviation industry?</h4><p>There are opportunities in maintenance, catering, and non-aviation services within the airport, such as duty-free shopping. That is how most airports make money. Airlines will also bring in increased revenues. In two years, the number of airlines serving Maputo Airport increased from two to five. Qatar Airways started flights from Doha in 2012, and we are also in talks with Lufthansa and Emirates with regard to opening direct flights from Germany and the UAE. Domestic air travel will also soon open up to foreign investment. However, for now, all airlines that want to operate in Mozambique have to be locally registered entities. Soon, Nacala, Pemba, and Tete will also start seeing more direct international services arriving at their airports.</p><h4>What is the current situation regarding the regulation of mobile operators in Mozambique? Is the government doing anything to promote increased entrance to the market in the communications sector?</h4><p>Not exactly. We already have a regulatory body that governs communications. Telecomunicaçíµes de Moçambique (TDM) runs the fixed-line market and there are three mobile operators. What we are doing now is to put together a commission to look at the implications of communications convergence.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>To what extent has LAM developed as Mozambique's national flag carrier since its establishment as part of the ports and railways service in 1936?</h4><p>Linhas Aéreas de Moçambique (LAM) was created in 1936 as Divisío de Exploraçío de Transportes Aéreos (DETA). At that time, the service was mainly to accommodate the transport of passengers to and from nearby countries. It was also created to establish a connection between the south and the north of the country to complement the service being provided by the railways. When Mozambique achieved independence, the government decided to restructure the sector and separated the transport service from the railways to develop them separately. The air transport company then adopted the name Linhas Aérea de Moçambique (LAM). At that time, the company owned four Boeing aircraft, and then later it bought a DC-10. In 1991, we started providing regular services to Lisbon, Paris, Rome, Madrid, Berlin, Sofia, Copenhagen, and Dubai. We also flew charters and contracted flights. Some of the destinations were Havana, Boston, Mecca, Dhaka, and others. Since then, there have been changes in the airline business, as it became a private entity in 1998 when the government owned 80% and the employees took a 20% share.</p><h4>How have you adapted domestic scheduling to cope with changing demand?</h4><p>We moved to a new type of aircraft to accommodate the flexibility that is required for different routes. With smaller aircraft, i.e., the Embraer (E190) and the Bombardiers (Q400), we are offering more direct flights than we were using the larger Boeings, with which we were offering multi-leg flights. We are growing quickly and our need to increase capacity is also rising. Two years ago, we were flying two or three times a week to most of our destinations, but we are now flying two times a day. This is a tremendous change, and we are increasing the size of the fleet to deal with the growing demand. Prior to doing this, we were combining Tete with Quelimane for instance, and we would have two frequencies. Now, we can have dedicated flights for each of these two destinations. There is flexibility and we need to accommodate.</p><h4>Is LAM's public service duty one of the barriers standing in the way of low-cost air travel in Mozambique?</h4><p>It could be, yes. If we had more capacity we could lower travel costs. Everything costs less when you have more supply. This applies to the cost of the ticket as well as the cost of the aircraft, accommodation, and food. I believe that more capacity will make things better, because the more passengers we fly, the more fixed costs will be diluted. There is a difference between low-cost and low-price carriers. To be low cost, you need to have low costs so you can charge a low price. In Mozambique, nothing is cheap. There is no way you could operate a low-cost airline here, unless you have lower direct operation costs including jet fuel, taxes, user charges, aircraft acquisition, safety, and security charges. The market is open for low-cost airlines, but it is too expensive to operate here, meaning it would be difficult to launch one. People say it is difficult to develop tourism because of expensive air transport, but what about the hotels? Until we have the volumes to bring all the costs of tourism down, then tourism will have difficulty developing at a rapid pace. The developed countries didn't develop overnight; it was a process and I believe Mozambique is in that process. It will take some time, but we are getting there. There are many airlines flying to Mozambique now.</p><div class="quote">“We are planning to fly to all the Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries by 2015."</div><h4>LAM is looking for a strategic partner for LAM International. How is that progressing?</h4><p>When talking about LAM International, we need to think about who is going to travel, and how many passengers we will have. Qatar Airways currently flies everywhere at the cheapest prices it can offer. At the moment, we don't have enough passengers to go intercontinental because many Mozambicans still lack basic needs and only a few can afford to travel. I don't think we have enough traffic at the moment until we develop the capacity for Mozambicans to travel around the country first. Also, our strategy is to develop domestic and regional traffic, and then build up to intercontinental travel. We are planning to fly to all the Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries by 2015. We launched a flight to Zimbabwe in 2012 and we are now working toward Malawi. For Mozambicans to fly intercontinentally, you need to make sure you have enough flights, because if you have one flight per week no one will want to go as they will have to wait a week before they can come back. People need some flexibility. That means that you need to offer three flights per week.</p><h4>What is your occupancy rate at the moment?</h4><p>In the peak season, for intercontinental service it will reach 70%; however, in the low season it will go down to 30%. We need an average of 70% across the year to make a profit. We used to have this in the past and I believe we will in the future. We had a flight to Lisbon in 2011, but it did not go well. Even though the peak season was good when everyone was on holiday, the low season occupancy rates dropped and the costs did not. We need to get enough traffic to cover the entire season.</p><h4>Which are your most profitable routes?</h4><p>Domestically, I don't think we have one that is the most profitable, as all of our routes are busy. In terms of cost efficiency, the one-hour flights are the most profitable in terms of cost effectiveness as they spend less fuel. Nampula is a very good flight for us, and is almost always full year round. Regionally, Johannesburg is a profitable route for us as it is very close and quick. The costs in South Africa are much lower as well, such as for catering and fuel. The demand is always there as well throughout the year; however, there is more competition with other airlines in South Africa.</p><h4>In 2011, you had a 15% increase in profit. What were the main contributing factors to that growth?</h4><p>Our industry is very influenced by currency. In 2011, the metical appreciated. Almost 80% of our costs are indexed to the US dollar, so whenever the metical devalues we need more meticais to pay the same US dollar bill, but then it works the opposite way as well. This factor had a good influence on our increased profits. We also have an excellent revenue management scheme. We used to have our flights full of low prices, but what we do now is allocate different seats into different price brackets to make it profitable. We have emerged from huge debts because of poor revenue management to making a profit. We have managed flights within the same tariffs allowing cheaper prices when the demand is lower, which has paid off.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[The Long Run]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[the-long-run]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Bertling has been in operation for 150 years in 46 countries. How does your history help you operate in a country like Mozambique?<br></h4><p>Bertling has been in Mozambique for 12 years. By the end of 2008, we signed a contract with Vale for the Moatize mine. Since then, we have developed in the country, and today we have five offices. We are in Maputo, Nacala, Beira, Pemba, and Tete. From the beginning it has been a challenge to understand the regulations and how to deal with the logistics for Moatize. We had a lot of cargo coming from South Africa by road, as much of the procurement is done there. We decided to add some operations offices in South Africa to follow the projects. We are now facing a new challenge with the customs system and its de-regulation, which from a business point of view is good; however, it is a problem that in  initial phase can create a lot of misunderstanding. The problem is that not all the countries are working on the same system.</p><h4>What are the current trends in the logistics and shipping industry in Mozambique?</h4><p>From a sea freight point of view, there is still a lot to be done. The equipment is quite old and there are also problems with the ports, jetties, and the stretcher, meaning that we do not have records of capacity. Every time we work with something heavy, we have to survey the jetty capacity. We have to conduct road surveys for bridge capacity and road limitations as well. On average, the regulation is up to 28 tons per truckload, but sometimes we have requests to have one piece of 450 tons. We cannot say no to our customers; it is not possible. We say yes; however, we have to do a proper road survey. We have to hire an engineering company, and we may have to build a bypass or new bridge. We will do whatever is needed to make the project possible. The only good roads are the ones from here to the border with South Africa; all the rest are the same. I went on some trips inland, where the road conditions are really chaotic, and this creates a real problem. These poor roads increase the price of freight because 100 kilometers could take up to six hours. There are a lot of projects and activities in very remote places in Mozambique.</p><h4>To what extent does Mozambique have the potential to become southern Africa's shipping hub?</h4><p>Everyone is looking to Mozambique now, but with the current limitations of the port operations and capacities, it makes it very difficult. When we talk about Nacala, the country's core terminal, the reality is that there is no airport in Nacala. You still have a runway, but it is only used by Vale because it has a private charter. The new airport in Nacala won't be finished until the end of 2013, so today if you have airfreight to Nacala, you have to fly to Nampula and then you still have a two-hour drive to Nacala. There is a brand new airport in Maputo, and compared to other airports in Africa it is brilliant. Nacala is the next one; Pemba will be finished soon as well. Pemba is being funded by private investment. Tete is fine; however, the runway is short. There are still many other places in the country you can fly to though.</p><h4>Why is Mozambique an attractive destination for logistics given the challenges?</h4><p>First, from a cultural point of view, Mozambique is quite different from what you find in West Africa. When you mention Africa in the international market, people have certain things in mind, which is really Nigeria and Angola. They are already an old story now as they are very different markets, and the big companies are already there. Those companies have already made their investments, they have settled down, and they are working. In Mozambique, there is a tremendous potential in gas, coal, and other minerals. Mozambique is geographically in a very strategic position, providing water access to its landlocked neighbors. Today, we talk about the three corridors, which are only growing. You have more and more enquiries from Malawi, Zimbabwe, Zambia, and even from the Democratic Republic of Congo. There is Dar Es Salam, which is a port that is very heavily used by Malawi. However, it is facing problems because of its huge volumes. All the ports in Mozambique that are registered as ports know what to do and how to do it; all they need is investment. It is a question of political decisions and investments. When you talk about investments, there are countries such as Brazil that are investing in a lot of projects in Mozambique. However, with the reserves and cash flow in this country, it still needs to be able to build and offer contracts.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As your second year as Executive Director of UNFPA draws to a close, what initiatives are you most proud of, and what are your most immediate priorities for the second term?<br></h4><p>The first half of my tenure as UNFPA's Executive Director was full of initiatives and activities that promoted the fund's mandate and mission: to deliver a world where every pregnancy is wanted, every childbirth is safe, and every young person's potential is fulfilled. To further improve the fund's accountability, we have developed a new and highly focused business plan, which aligns our vision with our strategic priorities and leads to more transparency while improving our ability to deliver results. This includes a stronger focus on our work in over 150 country offices around the world. We have strengthened their capacity and presence, particularly in dealing with humanitarian emergencies. In addition, we have developed a new communications strategy to better showcase the work UNFPA is doing in developed and developing countries. UNFPA has also reinforced its position as a global thought leader in terms of reproductive health and population issues, with a specific focus on working with young people, who are energetic partners and the future generation that will lead and change our world.</p><h4>What are the strengths and challenges that differentiate Mozambique within your Sub-Saharan operations?</h4><p>Mozambique stands as a success story in Africa. It is one of the fastest-growing economies in Africa, and many new investors are coming to the country to explore opportunities. The UN system is also implementing the “Delivering as One" initiative, which UNFPA is part of, in Mozambique. We see a strong donor country presence in the country, which leads to resource mobilization opportunities mainly for reproductive health commodities, adolescents, sexual and reproductive health (SRH), reproductive rights, and activities related to censuses; however, there are also challenges. Although the economy is growing, Mozambique still depends on aid from other countries, especially in the social sector. There are also notable social and regional disparities. Mozambique shares many of the challenges that other countries in Sub-Saharan Africa face: high levels of maternal mortality and a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS, a low coverage of medical doctors, few skilled birth attendants, and weak infrastructure and transportation. In addition, medical doctors, experienced nurses, and health managers are leaving the public sector to join NGOs and private enterprises. Mozambique's young population offers immense opportunities, but also calls for increased investment to ensure that education, health, and employment reach these young people, and in particular girls, who are often the most vulnerable. UNFPA supports country operations and programs as well as regional policy frameworks, which are aimed at garnering mutual support and commitment to address these critical issues. Mozambique has a number of trade corridors from neighboring countries to its ports and from its growing inland extract industries. This poses additional challenges to the healthcare system and vulnerabilities for its population. UNFPA is working with government and civil society organizations to prioritize interventions for the most vulnerable and at-risk population in these areas.</p><h4>How do you assess the success of UNFPA's seventh program of assistance to Mozambique, and what initiatives define the current phase of interaction?</h4><p>Through its seventh Country Program 2007-2011, UNFPA supported the population and housing census in 2007 and helped improve the availability of population data for planning at the national and provincial levels. Also, we contributed to strengthen policies to improve quality and access to SRH. These efforts are also in line with the national integrated plan to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the national strategy for family planning. In the area of reproductive health, our support was critical to increase the amount of deliveries attended by skilled health personnel, the coverage of institutional births, and the use of modern contraceptives, from 11% in 2007 to 23% at the end of 2010. In the field of HIV prevention and adolescent SRH, UNFPA's support has been key. The cross-sector youth program Geraçío Biz, established with UNFPA's support and with funds from Norway, Denmark, and Sweden, is recognized as a best-practice example in the region. During the seventh Country Program, the number of community peer educators grew significantly, the number of health providers trained to deliver youth-friendly services tripled, and 1.4 million students were reached through school outreach activities. As for the current phase, for the first time in Mozambique, 21 UN organizations developed one action plan to jointly contribute to a set of common outcomes, replacing individual organization action plans and staying in line with the national development plans. Within this program, UNFPA focuses on maternal health and adolescent SRH and has an integrated approach to ensure the complementarity and effectiveness of support to policy development, demand creation, and service delivery at a national level and in selected provinces.</p><div class="quote">“Mozambique is committed to gender equality, and gender-sensitive legislation is in place."</div><h4>How do you rate Mozambique in terms of gender equality and the implementation of gender-sensitive legislation?</h4><p>Mozambique is committed to gender equality, and gender-sensitive legislation is in place, which is an important first step. The country has made significant progress in the areas of gender equality and women's empowerment. Some examples are: the government's creation of the Ministry of Women and Social Action, which set up the National Commission for Women's Advancement (with provincial and district ramifications), and gender focal points in all ministries. There are also gender focal points in non-governmental organizations, churches, and private enterprises. Key ministries, such as Education, Health, Agriculture, Energy, and Public Service, also have a gender strategy in place. I commend Mozambique for ratifying several legal instruments, such as the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) in 1993 and the Beijing Platform for Action in 1995. The country signed on to the Millennium Development Goals and the Plan of Action for Poverty Reduction in 2000 and the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Protocol on Gender and Development in 2010. Apart from these international agreements, Mozambique's constitution refers to gender equality as a must. The country has a gender policy and an implementation strategy. In 2004, Mozambique approved the Family Law and in 2009 approved the Law on Domestic Violence Against Women. The government and civil society are working together to promote gender equality. In this process, they have teamed up with the UN system in the country, of which UNFPA is a key player. Its strategy has been to strengthen the technical capacity of government and civil society for the implementation of the commitments made at international, regional, and national levels in relation to gender issues. The existence of gender-sensitive political frameworks and policies is boosting progress toward equality. Still, gender disparities persist in some areas, and in particular education, economic opportunities, and health. Gender parity in enrollment at the primary school level has been achieved and improved at the secondary school level, but, unfortunately, not all girls complete the full literacy cycle. There is a high rate of child marriage and adolescent pregnancies. As a result, the rate of school dropouts is high. Despite improvements over the last decade, women's illiteracy in Mozambique continues to be high, and this also impacts access to economic opportunities. Indicators related to women's SRH also confirm the persistence of gender power inequality in the country. Despite a remarkable commitment to reverse the trend, the fertility rate, especially among adolescents, remains high, and gender-based violence continues to be of concern.</p><h4>In what specific ways does the UNFPA support Mozambique's ability to collect and analyze data and develop population projections?</h4><p>UNFPA recognizes that quality and disaggregated data is critical for development planning, monitoring, and accountability. We do share our successful census experience in Mozambique with other countries, such as Angola and Botswana, through South-South cooperation. UNFPA provides technical support to the National Institute of Statistics (INE) and the Centre for Policy Analysis (CAP) at the Eduardo Mondlane University (UEM) to improve their capacity to collect, analyze, and research data. Additional support is given to the INE to plan and implement the general population and housing census (1997 and 2007); of the $38 million budgeted for the 2007 Population Census, about $26 million was mobilized by UNFPA, representing about 60%. We also organize training courses and develop population projections. UNFPA supports the CAP and UEM in carrying out a Master's program in population studies. Annually, five scholarships are awarded to students to enroll in master degree courses in population and development.</p><h4>What is your vision for the role of civil society in the development of Mozambique and Sub-Saharan Africa in general?</h4><p>In Mozambique, civil society organizations became very active after the end of civil war in the early 1990s. In the beginning, the focus of their work was on reconstruction. Currently, civil society organizations are working in various areas, and are very active in health, human rights promotion and protection, governance, and the environment. They implement activities aligned with government strategies and the MDGs. Moreover, they monitor the implementation of public policies and development programs. By doing so, civil society organizations are playing a great role in the country's development. As in many countries, churches, religious affiliations, and faith-based organizations play an important role in peoples' way of living and engagement in development in Mozambique. UNFPA sees civil society organizations as important partners in achieving universal access to SRH. They are critical in the formulation of development policies and programs. Our collaboration with civil society organizations is excellent. We have fostered various initiatives, which go beyond government plans, including the participation of civil society organizations and parliamentarian networks: the Campaign for the Accelerated Reduction of Maternal Mortality in Africa (CARMMA) and the Maputo Call of Action and Africa Youth and Adolescent Network on Population and Development (AfriYAN), aimed at supporting countries as they work to achieve the MDGs.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does AMI Hospital Maputo encourage people to stay in Mozambique for hospital treatment?<br></h4><p>We are a commercial and business venture. I have worked in Africa for the last 14 years, and the challenge is that African private hospital patients tend to leave for Europe, India, or South Africa. Our hospital in Maputo is a specialist hospital that focuses on the needs of the community, and includes maternity, women's health, children's health, and specialized surgery departments. The hospital specializes in medical and surgical disciplines and has 35 beds, a delivery room, a 24-hour emergency center, an X-ray department, a CT scan center, 3D ultrasound machines, three ICU beds, two neonatal ICU beds, and two theaters. We believe that by having this mix, we are able to retain most of the care related to those conditions in our facility. The expatriate and affluent communities will generally select medical treatment outside of Mozambique. From our perspective, we are also trying to keep those patients here or compete with the South African provision of treatment for various conditions.</p><h4>How has the uptake been since the hospital opened in 2010?</h4><p>Revenues have steadily increased since we opened in 2010, so there is definitely a demand for private hospital care. There is enough credit demand from health insurers and large corporates to send their employees to the hospital to complement cash-paying consumers. My philosophy is that you have to set up the right mix at the hospital to address the appropriate demands in Maputo. Our patients are overwhelmingly local.</p><h4>What are your plans for growth?</h4><p>We are a focused specialist hospital for women, children, and surgery. Other hospitals are larger and more general. If you find a niche then there is definitely room for opportunity. At this stage, we are focusing on opening a facility in Tete as well as our existing 35-bed hospital in Maputo. Tete is growing extremely fast and there is definitely a need for a health facility. From an opportunity perspective, everything points to Tete over other locations at the moment. We don't have any immediate plans to go anywhere else in Mozambique.</p><div class="quote">“Revenues have steadily increased since we opened in 2010, so there is definitely a demand for private hospital care."</div><h4>How do you overcome hurdles in terms of hiring qualified medical professionals?</h4><p>It is a problem. In terms of specialists, it is difficult, but they are there and we are able to find them. In essence, you do have to go abroad to fill some positions. However, there are adequate nursing resources available here as well as paramedics. Mozambican doctors, if they leave, go mostly to South America, the EU, or the US. There are excellent specialists in Mozambique, and they do well in their own right, but it is difficult for a private hospital to attract them because essentially they can pick and choose where they work.</p><h4>AMI currently operates in Mozambique, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe. How significant is Mozambique to your portfolio?</h4><p>At the moment, it is the most significant part of our portfolio. I think it will become one of the most effective countries for our investments. We plan to go into other countries in West Africa. Obviously, there are much bigger markets out there. Mozambique will always be one of our top markets, but you can't compare somewhere like Nigeria to Mozambique. We are looking at Nigeria and possibly other countries like Uganda and Ghana.</p><h4>How would you characterize Mozambique's healthcare market, and which areas would you identify as most attractive for investment?</h4><p>Mozambique has an immature private healthcare sector. It is surprising that investment has started at the private hospital level. There is definitely an opportunity for development in private healthcare at the primary level. There is a lot of potential for investment in pharmaceuticals and consumables distribution, and there is also an opportunity in medical information systems. Essentially, there are opportunities all along the medical value chain, and this is necessary for the maturation of the market.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Mozambique progressed since it gained independence in 1975?</h4><p>When the ceasefire between the Liberation Front of Mozambique (FRELIMO) and Portugal was signed on September 7, 1974, the country was very backward due to the negative effects of Portuguese colonization. The Mozambican people were uneducated and suffered from an economy that was geared toward the prosperity of Portugal. Of course, due to the struggles that we were waging against colonialism, the Portuguese government tried to make some cosmetic changes. The education sector was comparatively strong; however, health services did not benefit the majority of the population. There were some parts of the country where there were only one or two doctors per 1 million people. The first university was created in 1962, but it was very small. In 1974, it had about 4,000 students. Another example was that people didn't participate in political activities. There was no political life for the Mozambicans here. Elections were known only to a fraction of Portuguese people because, at that time, even Portugal itself was under a dictatorship. After Mozambique proclaimed its independence, things changed very quickly from 1975 to 1982. Attendance at educational institutions tripled. In the 1980s, African nations recognized Mozambique as a model. It was a progression from darkness to the light in terms of having access to education. During this time, Mozambicans began to gain an understanding of politics. It was an era of democratic development. Then we had a setback, a civil war, which destroyed everything we were doing. The majority of everything we had built was destroyed. This carried on for 16 years, and that is what led us to fight for peace. When we fought for liberation, we were also fighting for peace. This time, it took on an armed form, as well as a diplomatic and political form. This led to the signing of the Rome Peace Accords on October 4, 1992. We had to start again with the reconstruction of everything that was destroyed. The country had made several gains in the areas of culture, energy development, and the development of mineral and carbon resources.  We had also made industrial advances, such as in the textile industry. Once the war was over, we had to conduct full reconstruction efforts throughout the country. We had to undertake our task in several directions. Construction was crucial, including assisting refugees, which numbered in the thousands. Infrastructure, including power lines, railroads, roads, schools, hospitals, and farms, all had to be rebuilt. Besides construction, we had to fight against poverty and at the same time lay down the foundation for development. We didn't want to wait until we finished the reconstruction to start the fight against poverty, or to wait until we could attract investment. We had to move together in all these directions. That is how we came to attract all this investment and create investments from within as well as a private sector, which did not exist before.</p><h4>What are the main priority areas that the country needs to focus on during the next five to 10 years?</h4><p>We have always seen agriculture as the basis for development. The mining sector was not a big priority for us. Even today, the current government believes that the priority should be agriculture. Agriculture transforms industry and produces renewable materials, even for energy. However, agriculture is more important for food security and self-reliance. Of course, to succeed, even in agriculture and other sectors of industry, you need infrastructure. It covers everything from the road networks that are used to commercialized products to electricity and telecommunications. Development can only be consolidated once these are ready, and only then can large coal and gas projects become viable.</p><h4>What role do you think the media, in general, can play in helping the country develop?</h4><p>Since the inception of the idea of freedom of expression and the right to information, many modes of media have been practiced due to the direct nature of our democracy. The media helped us consolidate the unity of the country by aiding us in orienting our people toward a common objective. A country like Mozambique, which had nothing at the time and was a melting pot of different ethnic groups and language barriers, had to be consolidated as a sovereign state. In 1998, we abolished the Ministry of Information, which was the ministry that worked in tandem with the media. We had to discuss and adopt a press law that would cover the administrative aspects of the media to coordinate all operations, without interfering with written content. Freedom of the press was enshrined in our constitution, and from that day everything became more visible and more understandable. Very few countries had reached our level freedom of press at that time. It was difficult to draft that law, and even the journalists themselves did not agree with each other in all aspects. The government had to intervene again, essentially to consolidate the ideas of the journalists themselves. Finally, we worked with the journalists to find a solution.</p><div class="quote">“Once the war was over, we had to conduct full reconstruction efforts throughout the country."</div><h4>What led you to set up the Chissano Foundation in 2005?</h4><p>The motivation was the perception of some of my former colleagues in government and elsewhere of what I did to bring peace back to Mozambique. They thought that we should capitalize on that to create the foundation, which would help to create a base for the continuation of the fight for peace and for the consolidation of stability. We realized that peace is not an end result, but instead that it has to be renewed constantly. There are also several angles of peace that have to be considered; it is not just the resolution of any violent conflict or war, but also conflict in social life, whether it is family relations, domestic violence, religious ignorance, or even poverty. When one thinks about peace, it has to be seen through all the different angles. In order to consolidate peace, one has to tackle more grassroots problems, such as hunger.</p><h4>How does the Chissano Foundation contribute to the development of the social fabric of the country?</h4><p>We do our best through volunteers who work with us to bring more knowledge and awareness to the people so that they can change by themselves. Culture is a large part of this. People are arriving in Mozambique from all corners of the world, while the cultural wealth of the country is not being developed. In the area of peace, we have created a partnership with the Polytechnic University to create the Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies. We want to make peace an innate part of human nature. Just like one knows how to dress and wash, one should know how to be peaceful. We are also creating “peace camps" for younger children to be educated about peace and culture, so that they can grow up to be ambassadors of our vision of peace. We are also developing a center where we train farmers in new agricultural techniques. This is done in conjunction with the Naandi Foundation to fight hunger and poverty. Through this scheme, we aim to help farmers market their products and to double, triple, or multiply their income by five.</p><h4>Where would you like to see the Chissano Foundation five years down the line?</h4><p>All of the projects that I have mentioned will be very visible to our nation, and then to the world. We think that we have found the key to implement what the foundation was created for. Our operations are non-profit, but in order to secure the funds to do all of these things, we came to the conclusion that we have to have an activity to generate funds. Therefore, we are going to create a company that will work for profit. However, these profits will be injected directly into the foundation for its use in various projects.</p><h4>How do you suggest Mozambicans should empower themselves to take charge of their economy and ensure sustainability?</h4><p>In view of all the discoveries of mineral resources, we should try to educate ourselves better. These resources are not the basis for our development. They are not sustainable and are finite by nature. We need something that will develop the country for generations to come. This begins by mastering technology, increasing knowledge as much as possible, and passing that down through the generations. Through increased creativity, each generation can develop new technology to make life easier. This continues with having to keep up the spirit of work. We cannot simply wait and buy food from elsewhere. People often tell me I am wasting my time with agriculture because there is too much food in the world. However, at the same time people around the world speak of a global food shortage.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[more-capacity-here]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As the oldest and largest university in Mozambique, how significant is Eduardo Mondlane University (UEM) to education in the country?<br></h4><p>UEM, which was created in 1962 as Estudos Gerais Universitários and later Universidade de Lourenço Marques, was the only institution that was responsible for higher education in Mozambique during the colonial period. The period after 1975, following independence, is the most significant. At the time, UEM was the only university in the country offering Bachelor's and Licenciatura degrees. By the 1990s, we realized that a university cannot only be a place of teaching. With that in mind, and with the help of our partners, we established research facilities as part of our institution. We also began to have students studying Master's and PhD degrees both internally and externally. UEM has been offering such degrees in Mozambique since 2001 and 2009, respectively.</p><h4>How have you partnered with international organizations?</h4><p>Starting at the end of the 1970s, we had lots of support from the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA), which was responsible for all teacher training within the institution. We also had support in that period from the World Bank, which was responsible for the infrastructure as well as training in some key areas. Recently, the number of partners has increased. We also have support from the Flemish part of Belgium, which is supporting sexual and reproductive health at the Faculty of Medicine. Italy is supporting the academic and research management system. Another major partner is South Africa, where many of our students study and we maintain many academic links. Through NORAD, we have cooperation with Namibia and Botswana, for example. Some of our lecturers also are external examiners in Swaziland. However, the biggest level of cooperation is with South Africa. In terms of scholarship opportunities, Australia, South Africa, and Europe are popular, and normally students return afterwards. Asia is not a popular destination yet, but China will probably be more prominent in the future.</p><h4>How is the university working with international companies to build human capacity to work in the highly technical environments associated with the mining and natural gas sectors?</h4><p>We have some courses within the university that are related to the areas that are now being discovered. UEM has a very strong department of geology, which does not deal directly with all of these things, but it deals with coal and natural gas. However, it was not very well oriented. With these new discoveries, we looked at our capacity, and we realized it was possible to direct our training toward the market's needs. We are also developing courses with Anadarko and ENI to meet the needs that are currently arising. We have our own funds that are designated to new courses. However, because of the great costs, UEM will also have to rely on private investment. If we want to run courses together, we also have to share the costs. The most expensive part is the equipment because we do not have everything we need here. A large amount of investment is needed. In terms of human capacity, I think we can retrain some of our people. In one or two years, they will be able to manage these new skills.</p><h4>What would you say is the biggest challenge currently facing the university?</h4><p>Our biggest problem is capacity—we receive approximately 30,000 applications per year for only 4,000 places. We have tried to expand by opening schools in the provinces, but even these do not satisfy the need. We should also try to offer distance education so we can reach people who are not necessarily in Maputo. Another challenge is related to the educational qualifications of the lecturers in the sister universities. Most of them only have a Bachelor's degree, with which it is impossible to give sound education at a university.</p><h4>What is the potential for the establishment of private universities?</h4><p>There is still potential. We have a population of about 22 million and the whole system is responsible for about 110,000 students. This means there are still many people who want to study at university. Unfortunately, the universities are not investing in science and engineering, which is more important for the development of the country. There is potential there for private institutions.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of INATUR's landmark achievements as it approaches its fourth anniversary?<br></h4><p>We've been in the industry for a long time, albeit under different names. Our biggest achievement is having exposed Mozambique to the international market as a credible tourism investment destination. However, INATUR can't take all of the credit for that as merit has to be given to the whole private sector, since it is marketing the country. Inatur is the official promoter, and its goal is to facilitate the entry of tourists and investors to the country. It also helps small Mozambican tour operators enter the market. At Inatur, we want to give pride and ownership to the Mozambican people. The tourism industry was historically run by the Portuguese and South Africans, but we are encouraging Mozambicans to play a role in the sector. We have been trying our best to make tourism an important industry for the economy.</p><h4>How has INATUR's portfolio increased over the past few years?</h4><p>INATUR was created mainly to market Mozambique as a tourist destination. However, over the years there was a need to incorporate more roles into INATUR, thus the change of name. Energy and mineral resources are very important for economic growth, but one should bear in mind that natural resources will finish one day, while tourism is a sustainable industry that will always be there. I believe that tourism and mineral resource development will grow together hand in hand.</p><h4>Which international markets have the most potential for companies coming to invest as well as incoming tourists?</h4><p>We see a high number of visitors coming from neighboring countries to visit friends and relatives, as well as Portugal due to cultural and historical ties. Lately, we have seen an increased number of inbound tourists coming from Western Europe as well as the BRIC nations. The main tools we use to penetrate these markets are participating in travel shows, organizing road shows for B2B meetings, producing marketing material, as well as going to conferences. These have been the main tools. We also use our embassies as a vehicle to distribute information. Additionally, INATUR works with public relations companies that are contracted to work in China and Germany. An official from the Ministry of Tourism has just been dispatched to Brazil, and one will be dispatched to China in the next six months. We also have a tourism official at our embassy in London. Arrival numbers have been increasing, even in years when the EU was hit by recession. Global arrival numbers have been up due in part to marketing efforts, but as well as the stability that we enjoy. The natural beauty of the country is also an asset.</p><div class="quote">“We are encouraging Mozambicans to play a role in the sector."</div><h4>What have the main challenges been?</h4><p>Lately, everyone has been talking about Mozambique due to the resource boom; however, there is a lack of infrastructure in the country. You can have pristine beaches and crystal clear waters, but you need infrastructure. We are not only attracting investors to build hotels, but also attracting companies to invest in infrastructure that the government is not able to provide.</p><h4>What are your targets looking forward to the next few years?</h4><p>I would be happy seeing 4 million to 5 million visitors per year being given top-quality service. I would also be happy to see a “Maldives" or “Mauritius" in Mozambique, with people drawn from all over the world. We always aim for the best; all of our efforts are to promote Mozambique to the outside world through our donors, corporations, and embassies. I would also be happy to see repeat tourists, as well as locals enjoying their own country. As much as it is important to attract foreign tourists, it is equally paramount to have Mozambicans be able to go to four- or five-star hotels in their own country. For now, a country like Mozambique does have other priorities, but I believe we are on the right track.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the hotel fared since the $25 million renovation in 2010?<br></h4><p>The main property was built in 1922, the Polana Mar wing was built in 1960, and the serviced departments came later. The renovation concentrated on the refurbishment of all of the rooms in the main building and the creation of the Maisha Spa, which is a very important product to capture not only the leisure market, but also to provide added value to the corporate segment—both international and domestic. We also developed the Aquarius Bar, the Varanda Restaurant, the Fine Dining Delagoa Restaurant, and the Polana Bar.</p><h4>How do you strike a balance between retaining the hotel's antiquity and also providing modernity to travelers?</h4><p>The renovations increased the quality, service, and comfort; however, there are people who feel that some changes took away a little of the old glamour. The point is that somebody needed to invest the $25 million, which was a huge investment. If you are a businessperson or you come to stay at the Polana for an extended period of time, you are able to feel all kinds of atmospheres and you see the different décors, meaning that your stay has a different feel. If you stay at the Polana, you can go to the Delagoa Restaurant and enjoy the décor and our fine dining cuisine, which is completely different from the Aquarius Bar, where you can order sushi and listen to jazz outdoors, or enjoy a quick meal in our All Day Dining Veranda Restaurant. From a refurbishment perspective, the objective was to improve not only the offer, but also to gain more space in order to provide added variety and options for the guest.</p><h4>How are you targeting the leisure market?</h4><p>We are developing concepts that have already begun to attract more families. We also want to create a kids' club. We are creating an atmosphere that is more child-friendly and have already developed a Sunday brunch for families and a package to attract people who want to spend time in our Spa while the children are looked after elsewhere. We are working hard to get more of the leisure market, and we will see how the market reacts. The major challenge we face at times is the high price of plane tickets. This causes people to fly to other destinations rather than to Maputo, because it is very expensive to come to this city for a weekend break. We will be working closely with travel agents in specific towns in South Africa, such as Cape Town or Johannesburg.</p><h4>How are you responding to Maputo's developing tourism and MICE market?</h4><p>First, the market will continue to grow because everything is happening in Mozambique and everything is running smoothly in terms of politics. There is a bright future for tourism, especially in the big cities, and there are considerable opportunities in terms of leisure. Mozambique is in the early stages of tourism development, so I think that a plan can be implemented to have tourism with a future. There are many trends that we can identify: people want to go to sustainable countries, experience new cultures, and want by-products that are environmentally friendly but also authentic. On our side, there is a desire to develop more units in Mozambique. We are looking at some properties, but for now we are only looking. We will see what the future brings.

		<url><![CDATA[first-steps]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Up until recently, most people did not see Mozambique as rich in extractives. In fact, the 2010 Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) report showed that the government received a total of $65 million from its extractives sector in 2010 (up from $40 million in 2009)—$20 million from mining and $45 million from hydrocarbons. This represented less than 6% of government expenditure and 1% of GDP. Although revenues from extractives are already an important contribution to public expenditure, the growth of this sector is set to escalate massively. Investments, particularly in offshore gas and in coal, are increasing exponentially and there are indications that these will easily exceed $10 billion in the next few years. There is a hive of activity along the coast, with large-scale gas exploration following the stunning discovery in the Rovuma Basin. Vale's mining operations look set to make Mozambique one of the largest coal exporters in the world, along with the gold and precious stones that are also being extracted throughout the country. It is a time of great opportunity. However, evidence from other countries demonstrates the enormous challenges of managing such massive growth in the extractive sectors.</p><p>How Mozambique governs its natural resources will determine its future. The EITI is one of the tools that Mozambique has chosen to help address this challenge. The EITI is a standard for annual disclosure and reconciliation of all revenues from its extractive sector. This allows citizens to see how much their country receives from oil, gas, and mining companies. On October 26, 2012, Mozambique was declared “compliant" with the EITI standard, meaning that companies and the government are reporting openly and accurately what is paid and received.</p><p>When I was in Mozambique in 2011, citizens were asking a lot more questions than just how much money is coming in. They wanted to know how much should be coming in, how much is being produced, who the companies are and what contribution they are making, what level of tax and royalty they are paying, where is the money going, what they can expect from it, and whether or not any money is going missing.</p><p>These are important questions for citizens to raise. The EITI creates a platform for these issues to be discussed openly. It can provide an open report of the numbers but it cannot provide the answers to these important questions, which must be thrashed out through public debate and through government systems of accountability. It is now for the Mozambicans to decide what more they want to use the EITI for. All stakeholders—the government, companies, civil society organizations, media, academia, parliamentarians, and international community—must do more to get useful information into the hands of the citizens and help generate more informed debate about how best to manage natural resource wealth. With that in mind, I would set out three challenges for the Mozambicans. Firstly, now that the country is EITI compliant, the EITI in Mozambique needs to consider going beyond the minimum requirements and try to contribute to a more informed national dialogue about natural resource governance. The 2009 Mozambique EITI report included a survey of whether companies would be willing to be transparent about their tax regime. That is a start, but I am sure that many would welcome additional information about questions such as production data, licenses contracts, and more. Secondly, the government should consider how it could integrate the EITI reporting into its own systems and ensure that EITI works in a complementary way alongside other reform efforts.</p><p>Finally, I hope that the data is also made more accessible and more useful to inform the public debate. There is a huge demand for more data, but it needs to be presented in a more understandable way and then disseminated, analyzed, and discussed to achieve better accountability. I think that 2013 is going to be a critical year for Mozambique. I hope that by the end of the year, its people, particularly the poorest people, will begin to see the fruits of its natural resource boom.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-big-squeeze]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will state-of-the-art equipment give Sumol+Compal a competitive advantage?<br></h4><p>Sumol+Compal is of European reference considering the quality of its know-how, its long-running expertise, and state-of the-art equipment. We believe that in order to keep a competitive advantage, companies must hold unique advantages. In our case, they come from our vast experience, commitment to innovation, and an uncompromising attitude regarding quality. We can only achieve this with top equipment and professionals. The strong competition we find in Europe and worldwide has turned Sumol+Compal into a model in terms of production standards, and that will also be the case when compared to South African producers. We believe we have a clear advantage compared to the present state of southern African industry.</p><h4>What are your plans to expand production in Mozambique?</h4><p>We currently sell approximately 2 million liters of juice, which is a low amount, but we hope to achieve much higher volumes in the coming years. The production capacity installed allows the company to achieve over 30 million liters, and given the excellent indications we are already receiving from the market, we expect that in the short run such capacity will become insufficient for the demand. Therefore, we have an ambitious expansion plan both in Mozambique and other countries, and the company is ready to make the necessary investments to meet the market.</p><h4>What are the strengths of production in Mozambique?</h4><p>We believe Mozambique is an excellent place to invest. The investment conditions ruled by the government are very clear and straightforward; the local authorities have a positive approach to serious business and make the investment process easy. The country itself holds huge opportunities, considering the economic growth forecasts for the coming years. Mozambique also holds a very interesting position, as it is considered the gateway to the wider Southern African Development Community (SADC) market. It is also fundamental that we already have a strong presence in the Mozambican market, through our strong local partner Tropigalia. It has several years experience of distribution in Mozambique. In addition, Tropigalia is one of the six largest investors in communications in Mozambique, and it has very strong brand recognition, which is extremely beneficial. For example, at the FACIM fair, Tropigalia alone had 24 stands. We are very optimistic about our future in Mozambique due to our privileged setup.</p><h4>Do you have plans to start growing fruit in Mozambique?</h4><p>For now, we still import pulp and concentrate from Portugal. However, we will start using local and regional suppliers, and our goal is to do this with most of the raw materials. We believe that a fruit-drink company with strong consumer brands is the best way to develop upstream business, like fruit processing and farming.</p><h4>How would you characterize Mozambique as place for investment?</h4><p>Mozambique is currently an entrepreneur's market, meaning that it is a place for professionals to expand foreign businesses and to offer value-added services. This window for entrepreneurs will last until 2015 at the latest. In that time, there will be an opportunity for investors to come in, study the market, and make a calculated decision to finance various companies that they feel are competitive and well positioned. Mozambique is unique in this part of the world in that it is a peaceful country and enjoys a certain level of stability. From that perspective, it will attract large investments. The business environment is very friendly, mainly because of the continuous effort by local authorities to establish and enforce very clear rules. The direct access to the SADC market is also key for the establishment of consumer-goods industries.</p><h4>Do you see multinationals coming in to represent direct competition?</h4><p>We expect to see international companies coming in and using Mozambique, not only as an internal market, but also as a stepping stone to access markets in the region. We cover all sectors of the non-alcoholic beverage market, although our core remains natural juice. Until now, there have been no multinational companies that have a worldwide natural juice brand. The company is used to competing with strong multinational companies and local players, in all 70 countries where it is now present. This gives us a clear advantage. Compal's 2020 vision is to expand throughout the SADC region.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-turning-point]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of your recent deals and what are your expectations for bulk transport in 2013?<br></h4><p>It is a turnaround for our company. The rail concession on the Sena line is very important, which initially equates to an allocation of 500,000 tons. As the capacity of the line expands in the future, our capacity will also increase in proportion to our 7.7% allocation. The key challenge in Mozambique is transport; the only way to make money is to put your commodity on the rail. Logistics is by far the biggest component of costs in Tete. Secondly, road transport to Beira is not a sustainable solution since the road would be destroyed and massive costs would be needed to maintain it. For us, it was a big step forward to get a rail concession, but it was also very hard work. We had to negotiate the rolling stock, which took us about two months. We managed to finalize the process, but the only area we have not covered yet is the Export Credit Insurance Corporation of South Africa (ECIC) approval, which I am confident we will receive. The rail concession was the quantum leap this company needed. Now we can build on that with confidence and start employing people to enable the expansion of our Minas Moatize operation. We have a more positive message and the market can see that this team is achieving the milestones it said it would. We will now start building credibility with the market. Suddenly, many things changed—in 2012 it was a very, very tough market. I had to look at the company and formulate a new strategy, but we made good changes and slowly things are starting to come together.</p><h4>How will your production plans be impacted by the recent increased estimate of resources?</h4><p>Our resource base increased by 31% and it lifted our confidence levels. There are many fault lines in the geology, and the increased confidence levels help us develop more accurate mine planning. We are now waiting for the updated reserve statement that will be released in 2013.</p><h4>What makes the environment in Mozambique unique?</h4><p>The government is very supportive, more so than in South Africa. In South Africa, the mining industry and government sit at two different poles, and the government doesn't go out of its way to help the mining companies. As far as challenges, there is a definite shortage of skills in Tete, as well as in the whole of Mozambique. We train people and put middle management on mentorship programs, but it takes time. Infrastructure is another huge constraint, but the government is starting to realize that it needs to take a more strategic stand. The next five years will be challenging in terms of infrastructure. Lastly, people have typically overestimated the percentage of coking coal yields in the Tete basin. It is in the order of about 20%, and that is if the location is close to the town Tete. In other areas, the coke yield decreases dramatically as you move away from the hub. I believe that we are fortunate to be in the sweet spot of the best-quality coking coal in the basin. A huge amount of R&amp;D has gone into the fine coal circuits of our wash plant to maximize coke extraction.</p><div class="quote">“Our resource base increased by 31% and it lifted our confidence levels."</div><h4>What is your forecast for the Mozambican economy as a whole?</h4><p>Mozambique is going to grow. Unfortunately, Tete will take a horizontal growth path until infrastructure is sorted, but considering the gas fields, there are massive expansions coming. Tourism is picking up as well. The general vibe in the country and attitude of the people is very friendly. Tourism will develop and I am very positive about Mozambique. It's definitely the spot to be in for the coming years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Energy firms are expected to spend $50 million in Mozambique over the next decade to help develop LNG. What role will National Oil Company of Mozambique (ENH) play in this?</h4><p>ENH is the national oil company, so we have the leading role when it comes to the development of the business in Mozambique. We work in conjunction with international oil companies. In most of our agreements, we have shares from 10% to 12%. We understand the Mozambican business environment, we have all the data, and we understand the geological potential of the country as well as what the actual needs are. In that respect, we bring something valid to any partnership. Our main role here is to make sure that the project happens on time to enable us to capture the market that can pay the prime price. We have to capture the prime markets, including the Far East and other Asian and Pacific markets. We also play an important role in the service area, which involves Mozambican entrepreneurs. We ensure that local involvement in no ways adds cost to the project and does not bring poorer quality to the services rendered. We act as an interface between the international oil companies and local entrepreneurs when it comes to services. We will also play a very important role in maintaining an equilibrium when it comes to supply and demand internally versus exports. We are working to ensure that labor-intensive downstream projects contribute to the sustainable development of the country, because you need projects that aid the need for natural resources, while also recognizing that these resources will not last forever.</p><h4>You have gone on record saying that ENH may take anything up to 40% and assume the operational control of blocks. Do you see that for the new tenders that are coming through in 2013?</h4><p>ENH has been an operator before. All of the appraisal work at the Pande and Temane onshore gas project and reserve certification was carried out by ENH. We have a short-term outlook when it comes to oil operations. That means being engaged in onshore projects. We will be the operator of fields that have either been relinquished by other companies or have a high potential. In the long run, we have to build our balance sheet. The Pande and Temane project is the only one that is on stream now, so the revenues out of that will lead to a situation where we can move offshore and be in a better, more ambitious position. It is most important to have a long-term vision. In the short term, we will become an operator, and in the long term we will build sustainability and competence. We need to build our balance sheet in a way that we can reinvest the proceeds of the projects we have.</p><h4>The Pande and Temane project now supplies gas directly to the Mozambican market. Which other areas onshore are most exciting for ENH, and what are you anticipating in terms of exploration discoveries for natural gas?</h4><p>We have two projects that we are looking at now onshore. One is the PSA area, and the other one is the Mazenga block, which is under discussion with the government. Then, there is Buzi, of which we own 25%. When we become operators, we will start from those blocks and go from there.</p><h4>To what extent will ENH have a more active presence in downstream operations?</h4><p>Our role downstream is mostly either as a promoter or as a shareholder. But our focus is not downstream as we are an upstream company, so we will focus on that. However, we will always get involved to make sure that the downstream sector comes along as well. We have to forge partnerships. One, which began in 1990, is in Inhambane Province. The electricity that supplies those districts is sourced from that natural gas, and then we supply gas to EDM and then EDM supplies electricity. Apart from that, we supply gas to households. We cover around 300,000 houses and hope to boost that to 600,000 in 2013. Each year we draw up plans to try and increase the number of people who use natural gas. It is cheap and if wages do not increase then people are offered cheaper rates, which is a huge benefit. The other project that we also brought in was the Maputo Project, which is a ring pipeline project from Matola to Maputo, and the second stage is to bring gas into houses.</p><h4>Are there any other areas that ENH would be moving into to synergize with public companies?</h4><p>ENH has a logistics area, and we are discussing a possible partnership with Mozambique Ports and Railways (CFM) to build and operate a maritime social service to supply services to the oil industry. The logistics side of the business is very important for us, and its development will be important for Mozambique's oil entrepreneurs.</p><h4>What levels of investment will ENH commit to for the logistics project with CFM?</h4><p>The project could be valued up to $400 million, but that has to be looked at over two stages. We are now collecting information from oil companies on what they need. We will first invest between $50 million and $100 million and that will be enough for one or two years. We will then boost investment later on if needed.</p><h4>Where is the geographical focus of the project?</h4><p>We will focus on Pemba and Palma because this way the major development will happen in the next five to 10 years. However, if the area of focus changes then we will adapt as our intention is to service the industry. We need companies to focus on their core business instead of spending time developing logistics operations. We will try to play our role in this respect and promote Mozambique on that side as well.</p><h4>What is your forecast for international interest in the new tenders on offer in 2013 given the fierce bidding war between Shell and PTT over Cove Energy's share in 2012?</h4><p>In some areas, I am quite sure there will be quite a lot of competition and good deals will come. I think it can be done. When we went for the tender in 2005, the Ravuma block was only one block and then it was split into seven. That boosted competition and increased the amount of activity. You cannot make discoveries without hard work. The government will give priority to those companies that are planning to do a lot of work in the first few years, as some firms will take their time.</p><h4>What are your expectations on finding commercial amounts of oil?</h4><p>If we find oil, that would be great, but if we find gas, we will not complain. Nowadays, gas is also a good commodity to have, either for internal use or export. We cannot talk specifics yet, as all we can mention is possibilities. Until you drill and discover something, it's all just statistics.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you define NICO's position in the Mozambique insurance market since its entry in January 2012?<br></h4><p>We are looking at ourselves more as a set-up project at the moment and concentrating on training our workforce and ensuring that all of the systems and procedures are fully functional. Upon entering the market, we have sought to do everything right. When we start trading, we will do everything to deliver a great service to our clients. Due to the lack of universities and colleges that offer insurance as a degree or diploma, the local insurance market has a shortage of skilled resources, especially when it comes to life insurance, and this means that companies need to proactively invest in training and NICO Vida will not be an exception. As far as visibility is concerned, we have not heavily advertised because we want to make sure that everything is running 100% before we start attracting attention. Having said that, we have already started receiving numerous queries from prospective clients, mainly through the brokers we work with.</p><h4>As a strong regional company, how important is Mozambique to NICO's portfolio?</h4><p>It is definitely significant. Through 11 group companies, NICO Holdings now has a presence in six countries: Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia ,and Zimbabwe. Considering the current macroeconomic conditions and mid-term forecasts of these countries, it is clear that Mozambique is showing the greatest potential. We are quite confident that NICO Mozambique has the potential to become one of the leading companies in the holding.</p><h4>How is NICO planning to increase the penetration of life insurance in a country that has a banked population of only 12%?</h4><p>There are two major hurdles that we intend to surpass: getting access to distribution channels and consumer education. With regards to access to distribution channels, although brokers still pay a very significant role and account for by far the largest portion of insurance transactions, when it comes to certain segments of society we need to look at alternative distribution channels. If we look at other countries such as Kenya or South Africa, we see how distribution can be done via mobile phones or through shop fronts. Banks are also playing an increasing role. With regard to consumer awareness, the biggest challenge is not only getting our clients to know our products but also to understand the culture of insurance. The corporate segment is enlightened as far as insurance is concerned, with some companies picking up the practice from their group companies in Africa, Europe, and Brazil, but the greater challenge is in educating the individual and out retail clients.</p><h4>In terms of pension funds, how would you describe Mozambique?</h4><p>Pension funds are obligatory for all companies operating in Mozambique, and this is overseen by the state institution INSS. What we have now is a complementary pension fund that supplements the government system. With the legislation that was passed in August 2011, which opened up the sector to privately run pension funds, we now have many companies that are interested in creating complimentary pension funds for the employees. While this trend currently applies to most of the large and mainly foreign-based corporate entities, we are confident that with time it will expand to other smaller companies. Individual pension funds are now also available, which means that even people who are self-employed can be part of a pension fund.</p><h4>What investment opportunities are open for pension funds in Mozambique?</h4><p>The major investment instruments are mainly in the money market in the form of fixed deposits, treasury bills, bonds, and real estate. The equity market is not very active as there are only a few companies listed on the stock exchange. The law also permits pension funds to invest up to 10% of fund assets outside Mozambique.</p><h4>Would you agree that the insurance brokerage scene seems to be strengthening in Mozambique?</h4><p>The insurance brokerage scene is indeed strengthening in Mozambique. Whereas five years ago we had fewer than 20 brokers in the market, currently there are more than 35. However, the top seven brokers take up more than 85% of the market share. When determining the influence of brokers, one must note that the influence depends on the insurance company. On one end some insurance companies source more than 60% of their business from brokers, while on the other end we have companies that prefer to concentrate on direct and bancassurance business.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does the new round of bidding for blocks in 2013 mean for Mozambique's policies regarding exploration?</h4><p>Today, we have companies working with us in exploration and exploitation activities for hydrocarbons  and other minerals. In terms of hydrocarbons, we have started large-scale natural gas production in the Pande fields. We are producing and exporting gas, as well as using some for domestic production. Our intention is to increase the quantities that we are using internally in Mozambique for power generation and for other utilizations. Basically, apart from the consortium led by Sasol in Pande and Temane, we have other areas in Sofala. We have three contracts for exploration in the blocks of Sofala, M10, and Buzi. The activities are running according to schedule. In the Rovuma Basin we have four blocks offshore under exploration. Three of them are under drilling operations, and while two of them are in more advanced stages than the others, all are on schedule. The intention is to start with natural gas production in 2018 in Rovuma, and I am sure that we will meet this target. We are carrying out technical studies to see if we can launch new blocks for tender, and in 2013 we will open some areas up to the private sector. We needed to investigate our geology in order to hold more effective discussions with the private sector. I believe that we will succeed in this. We need to complete some milestones quicker, meaning we cannot allow for delays. We need to learn from the results of other tenders and see which areas we will open.</p><h4>What role do your foresee for the National Hydrocarbons Company (ENH) in these new blocks, and with regard to further exploration?</h4><p>In all blocks that we are offering, ENH is participating. We understand that when we talk about resources we need to make sure that the Mozambican people will be the first to benefit. This is why we have ENH for hydrocarbons and the Mozambique Mining Exploration Company (EMEM) for other minerals. There is no difference between the treatment we give to ENH or the Italian group Eni, for example. They all have to comply with the rules and legislation. ENH is part of all the projects, and in the future we can sell some shares to the public in these Mozambican entities.</p><h4>Do you foresee ENH having a larger share, such as 40%, or operating blocks?</h4><p>Today, ENH has between a 5% and 30% share, though maybe in the future it will have more. If ENH has the capacity to do so, then its share will increase; it depends on capacity. If ENH has the capacity to operate at a high level, I do not see problems.</p><div class="quote">“We are carrying out technical studies to see if we can launch new blocks for tender."</div><h4>CMH is a special purpose vehicle created specifically for operations in the Pande and Temane gas fields with Sasol.  With new onshore gas fields being explored, will its mandate be extended?</h4><p>CMH was created specially as a vehicle for the Pande and Temane project. We will see if CMH will be in the other blocks, or if it will focus only on Pande and Temane. We need to look at the advantages of having CMH in other blocks. We are studying how to deal with this issue because we have ENH, and in the future we will want to sell some shares to the public. We need to see how CMH will fit, or if it will fit into our plans.</p><h4>What role do public-private partnerships (PPP) have in developing the necessary infrastructure to facilitate, export, and benefit from the natural resources in Mozambique?</h4><p>I think that if we want to succeed, a PPP is needed. Mozambique cannot do business without the private sector. For LNG-related projects, PPPs will be important and will be considered. We need to bring together the private sector and the public sector to complement our projects. For the LNG plant, for example, we prefer to have all the companies working together when possible.</p><h4>Another area of exploration is Lake Niassa. How would you characterize your negotiations with Malawi in exploring this area?</h4><p>We do not want to explore the entire country at the same time. We are only concerned with a few areas for the next tender. I am not sure if we will consider Lake Niassa or Rovuma. We are analyzing the data and then we will make a decision.</p><h4>To what extent is vast exploration for minerals detrimental to Mozambique's agricultural sector?</h4><p>The agriculture and mining sectors can coexist. If you go to Moatize, you will find that there are some areas that specialize in agriculture. The question is, where is the best place to specialize in agriculture? If you go to Angónia, a district in the northern part of Tete, for example, the agriculture sector is excellent; however, unfortunately I do not know if there is coal, but if there is coal in Angónia, it will be great for the next generation. It is a question of balance, to see how best to use the resources that we have.</p><h4>What would you say are the key points that investors should be aware of with regard to the new petroleum law?</h4><p>I think that our legislation is excellent. We are trying to review some issues in order to fill in some gaps, but the revisions will still be attractive to investors. I have many companies queued up to come to Mozambique. The investors must be sure that what we want in Mozambique is to give them rights to explore; however, we want to have benefits from the exploration activities. It does not make sense if a company spends $10 million on a license and for business reasons it goes to a stock exchange in London or Sydney and sells it for $1 billion. The Mozambican people do not benefit from that. The legislation ensures that the assets are here in Mozambique; it is a question of a balance of benefits, both to the Mozambican people and the investors. I know that in other countries when you want to relinquish the license you do not have the right to transfer your rights to another person. Here in Mozambique, we allow this opportunity. If you do not want to continue, then it is business, you can transfer your rights, but we want to have some benefit from the transfer.</p><h4>Is there a need to renegotiate contracts?</h4><p>Contracts are contracts. It is a business venture that two parties need to discuss and reach an agreement. When you do business you are prepared to talk anytime about what you have signed, and what you want to have. Our contracts are new; the only contracts that were signed 10 years ago are those with Sasol and Kenmare. All the other contracts are just three or four years old. We need to balance what we want to gain through renegotiations.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Given speculation concerning the oversupply of natural gas and LNG, is East Africa at risk of missing the LNG boom if Mozambique's gas doesn't come onstream by 2018?</h4><p>The natural gas discoveries in the Rovuma Basin represent a tremendous opportunity for Mozambique and our partnership. It is extraordinarily rare to find resources of this scale in today's world. We believe there is an optimal window for securing terms that will meet the requirements of the LNG project, the Mozambican government, and the joint venture. Estimates for supply and demand vary widely, so it is important for us to control what we can and ensure we develop the resources as safely and cost effectively as possible, keeping in mind that a significant factor will be the cost of Mozambican gas compared to other competing projects around the world. One tremendous benefit in Mozambique is the world-class scale of these resources. From the upstream development perspective, we anticipate that we will be very competitive and be able to offer a premium product at a premium price. These are excellent reservoirs with exceptional flow rates. We have tested wells at rates of 100 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day, and believe the wells are capable of producing 200 MMcf per day. These are very high productivity wells, so the amount of drilling we need to do to be able to feed an initial 10 million ton per annum development is relatively low. Another benefit to Mozambique is that our targeted markets are seeking new supply sources and Mozambique offers a huge resource base that can supply them for the next 40-60 years with competitively priced LNG. We are moving forward in cooperation with the government. The technical side of the project is well advanced, and we are making progress on the other fronts as well.</p><h4>What is the potential to diversify production so that LNG could supply both hinterland countries and the domestic market?</h4><p>Our current plan is to sell our gas as LNG directly to the international market, which brings the most value to all stakeholders. The fact that the fields are offshore in deep water means that their development will require significant investment, although the quality of the resources and our ability to drive efficiencies in our business will help minimize costs. Currently, there's no domestic market in Mozambique, so we are focusing on LNG exports and the revenues that exports can create for the government. The government is reviewing its options through the development of a gas master plan, and there may be some opportunities in the future for greater domestic use. Additionally, the government will have a significant volume that it may choose to commit for domestic use through royalties and equity in the projects.</p><h4>How would you characterize the appetite for long-term LNG buyers in Asian markets?</h4><p>The interest appears to be very high in Asian markets; they see this as a potential new long-term supply of cleaner energy. This enormous volume of gas along with a multi-train LNG project could provide a long-term, competitively priced supply of gas to these markets for many years to come. The natural gas resources are in place to elevate Mozambique to the third-largest LNG exporter in the world, behind Qatar and Australia.</p><h4>What are your crucial milestones before further investment decisions are taken in 2013?</h4><p>From an offshore perspective, we need to get certified reserves for the initial two trains—we are on target to do that in early 2013, so from the lenders' and buyers' perspectives, we will have certification that we have the natural gas they seek. Environmentally, we recently completed a comprehensive draft Environmental Impact Assessment, which basically lays out our plans for developing the resources with a minimal impact on the environment. The land for the liquefaction facilities has been selected, and we are working on other aspects that go along with that for financing. We're engaging with the government on the necessary contractual and legal arrangements required for an LNG project of such magnitude. We are also engaged in actively marketing the LNG to potential buyers and customers.</p><h4>Are you still on track to have committed $3 billion worth of investment by the end of 2013?</h4><p>By the end of 2012, we expect to have invested about $2.2 billion in the project. By the end of 2013, we'll likely be in the range of $3 billion to $3.5 billion investment in the project, which is significant for Mozambique. For the LNG plant, including the liquefaction facilities, upstream development, and transportation, we expect to invest about $15 billion to complete the initial two trains.</p><h4>Will Anadarko partner with Eni to build the plant?</h4><p>Since the Prosperidade complex straddles the block lines between our block and Area 4, unitization is called for under the Petroleum Law in Mozambique. Though no agreement is currently in place, we have discussions ongoing with the government and Eni relating to both the offshore and onshore development. We have a long-established and good working relationship with Eni, having had operations with it in many other places around the world.</p><h4>Does it worry you when Nobel prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz and Former Prime Minister Luisa Diogo call for the renegotiation of concessionary contracts?</h4><p>Responsible development of the natural gas resources in the Rovuma Basin represents a transformational opportunity for Mozambique and its people. It is essential for the future of any project and foreign investments that host governments adhere to contracts and maintain fiscal stability. Our contract is a tax royalty contract, which we view as a fair contractual arrangement for the government and the partners. Under the terms, the government receives royalty gas and significant tax revenue as we are subject to the 32% corporate tax rate just like everyone else. The government also receives a large volume of profit gas that can be exported as LNG or used for domestic purposes if it chooses. Once the first project is completed under a stable legal and contractual framework, we believe the buyers will recognize Mozambique as a preferred supplier for years to come, and that can create wealth for the country.</p><h4>What is Anadarko doing in regard to investing in education such as developing courses at Eduardo Mondlane University (UEM)?</h4><p>One of the pillars of our social-investment strategy in Mozambique is education and training. Anadarko is working with the University of Eduardo Mondlane (UEM) to develop a petroleum engineering curriculum here in Maputo. It's linked with several universities in the US, including Texas A&amp;M and the University of Oklahoma. It's progressing well, and we are excited by the prospects that Mozambique will train its own professionals rather than send them to the US, Europe, or elsewhere. The industry and country as a whole will see benefits from that program for years to come. We have assessed the capabilities in Maputo and what is needed, both on the equipment side and on the curriculum side. We'll start putting that together and implement this plan in 2013.</p><h4>What level of employment is Anadarko providing for Mozambicans?</h4><p>Currently, we employ well over 1,000 Mozambicans, either directly or indirectly. We have an onshore and offshore block. The onshore block is more labor intensive, and there are several hundred people currently employed in the project. We are looking at vocational training, which is a big focus for the government. It's important to recognize that while you may have 10,000 people on-site during construction, it takes far fewer to efficiently run an LNG plant. Over time, as a trained workforce is developed, it is our expectation that more and more of these positions will be filled by Mozambicans. The vast majority of job creation generally occurs through indirect or induced employment opportunities. As part of our LNG project management, we will work to ensure that our contractor establishes training programs to provide basic skill sets and looks to employ as many Mozambicans as possible during construction and production. We are also actively recruiting a number of Mozambican engineers and technicians that we can take to the US for two or three years to work in facilities for on-the-job training in offshore environments and gas plants—the idea being that they will come back and ultimately end up as supervisors. We have very qualified Mozambicans working in our offices in Maputo and Pemba. The challenge is there are not enough, and the competition is very intense.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the large influx of expatriates and foreign companies affected the local real-estate market?<br></h4><p>In Maputo, it is difficult to find high-end properties. This lack of properties increases market prices, which are reaching a level that has never been seen before. Apartments are selling for up to four-times their market value. Until the market reaches a state of equilibrium, we won't see prices stabilize. New developments are being built; however, demand continues to exceed supply. The positive side of this increased demand for high-end property is that construction quality is improving and developments are beginning to be in line with international quality standards.</p><h4>Are these new developments catering only to expatriates or is affordable housing for locals  being built as well?</h4><p>Most of the developments are destined for expatriates and wealthy Mozambicans. Regarding affordable accommodation, some projects are already about to start, but as long as there is the problem with the interest rate on loans, it will be very difficult for people to access financing. There have been discussions to change the laws regarding loans, mortgages, and property acquisition. Interest rates are expected to fall to the single digits by the end of 2013. Until then, access to credit is limited to people who have the available cash.</p><h4>How would you compare the residential and commercial real estate sectors?</h4><p>The residential sector is booming, although compared to the commercial sector it is still very slow. New commercial real estate developments in Maputo are often sold out before construction even finishes. There has also been an increased demand for commercial real estate in the provinces, although there tends to be a higher demand for industrial property there, such as warehouses, factories, and agricultural projects.</p><h4>How have government initiatives to ease property acquisition by foreigners impacted your company?</h4><p>When Mozambique gained independence, many of the houses the Portuguese left were turned into state-owned houses. Those houses can never be sold to anyone who is not Mozambican. Other properties are now available to foreigners to buy. Foreigners can also be granted rights to develop land and build on it subject to the condition that they start building within a strict time frame after having acquired the rights. The Investment Promotion Centre (CPI) also has an incentive that allows foreigners to import a boat, a plane, or a car duty free into the country. It is excellent that Mozambique has opened the door to foreign buyers as this has led to large amounts of investment coming into the country.</p><h4>What differentiates Pam Golding from other real estate companies in Mozambique?</h4><p>The market here is very informal, but we are a global brand. Pam Golding has its own procedures and its own policies. Pam Golding is a legitimate company that foreigners, educated people, and wealthy Mozambicans recognize. We have a global presence, and international clients who look for property in Mozambique usually come to Pam Golding through our website. We have international partnerships in place to add to our own strong network, and this benefits us immensely. These partnerships include other real estate companies, investment funds, advisory firms, as well as wealth management companies. We are actively working to ensure that the market becomes more formalized.</p><h4>What potential is there for other companies to enter the Mozambican real estate sector?</h4><p>We are seeing numerous developers coming into the real estate market. This is mainly in Maputo, Tete, and Nacala. These developers are coming in both from abroad as well as from within Mozambique itself.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>To what extent has MOTA-ENGIL taken advantage of publically financed projects from Portuguese funds in Mozambique?<br></h4><p>MOTA-ENGIL is a civil construction company in Mozambique. During its 24 years of operations in Mozambique, it has created roots and built a dynamic development of resources in order to be able to compete with all sorts of companies of different nationalities operating in this country. In regard to the projects funded by the Portuguese, the company has won various tenders that were launched because of its know-how in internationalization and knowledge of the difficulties of Portuguese competition at the time. We aim for large infrastructure contracts that are necessary for the construction of Mozambique. Projects have included a road linking Massinga and Nhanchengue, the road between Chimoio and Espungabera, the Tete Bridge over the Zambezi River, a village for the 10th All-African Games, and two Olympic swimming pools.<br></p><h4>Why do you think MOTA-ENGIL has been so successful in Mozambique?</h4><p>Today, MOTA-ENGIL is an integral part of a multidisciplinary group with expertise in areas such as railways, ports, waste management, environment, renewable energy, as well as being service providers and operators of highways, ports, and railways. We looked back and saw that our stance was always very ambitious with an aim to work more and create critical mass by engaging in the satisfaction of our customers, translated by the alliance's “deadline confidence."</p><h4>How does MOTA-ENGIL contribute to development of human capital in the country?</h4><p>Over the years, we have faced a variety of difficulties, including the great distances that separate our delegation in Maputo and areas of operations—on average about 2,000 kilometers. It becomes almost impossible to train workers in all specialties in time so we have opted to train workers at the job sites knowing beforehand that with the conclusion of the work, these workers will not want to leave the region where they live.</p><div class="quote">“We aim for large infrastructure contracts that are necessary for the construction of Mozambique."</div><h4>How has the company changed with the coal and gas boom in terms of growth and opportunities for working with companies like Vale?</h4><p>Fortunately, our group anticipated its internationalization by creating poles of development across continents. Today, we   are not only in Mozambique in terms of civil construction, but we have created a critical mass far greater and more sustainable, with the creation of several subsidiary companies. We have included them in the group in order to present ourselves in any market with the highest number of possible opportunities. In the case of the Brazilian company Vale, we have just begun exploratory contacts for future projects to be executed in the center and north of the country.</p><h4>How much has the discovery of coal and gas impacted MOTA-ENGIL's portfolio?</h4><p>As in all national or foreign companies that are dedicated to construction or service providers, we have our eyes on Mozambique. In our case, we already have in our order book the execution of large infrastructure projects, including the rehabilitation and improvement of the Sena railway line as well as the construction of the Tete Bridge. We expect that companies like Vale, Rio Tinto, ENI, and Anadarko, (all familiar with our portfolio and experience in Mozambique) will invite us to perform large parts of their projects in the near future.</p><h4>The Nacala Corridor is a huge project for the company. How did landing this tender change the landscape at MOTA-ENGIL, and how has it affected operations in Mozambique?</h4><p>The final agreement of the Nacala Corridor was officially signed in July 2012, and will involve the construction of a new 45-kilometer railway between Mozambique and Malawi, which will employ about 1,000 workers. The corridor is part of a railway that will extend for 1,000 kilometers from the Moatize mine in Tete to the port of Nacala, across Malawi. It is essential infrastructure for the outflow of mineral resources. We are already building a section of the railway line that crosses Malawi via a tender issued by Vale. Regarding construction or road rehabilitation, we await the release of resources by the government.</p><h4>MOTA-ENGIL was also awarded several major road construction tenders. How is this significant?</h4><p>For the country, it is imperative that the road network be improved and expanded in all its aspects as well as all other complementary projects adjacent to them. In my opinion, ANE has done a great job with the knowledge it has gained for the country regarding the outflow of products and essential commodities for the populations throughout all provinces. However, there is still much work to be done, particularly regarding maintenance due to the intense traffic that is expected. To Mota-Engil, it is a framework that will require us to do our best in order to create a sustainable future for our organization that already has a dimension that today competes with large multinationals operating in Mozambique.</p><h4>Would you say a lack of financing for big projects is holding back Mozambique's development?</h4><p>The development of project financing has been slow due to the risks involved and the lack of information; the processes could be faster. In the case of obtaining financing for large companies, it has also not been enthusiastic, because it still requires a great degree of procurement and a level of negotiations that sometimes causes projects to be aborted even though they have solvency.</p><h4>How has the impact of the financial crisis in the EU, and especially in Portugal, affected operations in Mozambique?</h4><p>It has had a great impact on the Mozambican economy, which is why you notice the rescheduling of major government tenders, as well as foreign investment. In terms of the responsibilities that the Portuguese government contracted for infrastructure works, we have not noticed any obstacles in payments.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>To what extent will Mozfoods' social enterprise model support the local agricultural market?<br></h4><p>It is definitely not the only model, but it is one that we want to extend to other areas of agriculture and to other provinces in Mozambique. The center of the country has a climate that is well suited for vegetable production. Originally, the business was developed to supply the UK and then extended to South Africa and the domestic market. Initially, all the production came from our own farms and later extended to other growers, which we brought into the system and supported through credit, inputs, technical assistance, and route-to-market guaranteed prices. Because our model is export-oriented, certain levels and parameters of quality have to be attained.</p><h4>What level of infrastructure did you have to invest in so you could ensure route-to-market logistics?</h4><p>Infrastructure is a major hurdle for anything you do in Mozambique. The most important infrastructure we have is telecommunications, which is also expensive. The roads, railways, and power infrastructure in Mozambique is limited. When we started our vegetable venture, all the pumps running the irrigation were operating with diesel, which comes at a very high cost. Today, all of those pumps are electric. In terms of infrastructure, we are much further ahead than we were before, but there are many other obstacles to overcome. One important element is finding reliable logistics partners.</p><h4>How much of your business will be directed to domestic supply rather than exports when the resource companies come in?</h4><p>Previously, 85% of our exports were destined for Europe, 14% for South Africa, and approximately 1% was allocated for Mozambique. However, now only 50% goes to Europe, nearly 30% to South Africa, and 20% to Mozambique. I hope in the not-too-distant future that about 50% of our business will be for Mozambique.</p><h4>What sort of competition do you face from imports?</h4><p>There is a large number of products that we cannot sell in the Maputo market, which is the largest one in the country. Our vegetable growing area is located in what is considered a fruit fly endemic zone. That means that we cannot take fresh products produced in a fruit fly area to Maputo, which is a fruit fly free area. Our best produce for export is a type of chili that we can sell in the UK for £9 per kilo, but I cannot bring it to Maputo because of the fruit fly restrictions. We supply South Africa with certain products produced in our farms in the center of the country, but similar products from South Africa are imported and sold in Maputo, for logistical reasons. However, there is a good explanation for this. There are no logistics to bring products from our farms to the south; it is 1,200 kilometers from our farms to Maputo, and the local airline only allows 150 kilos of produce a week to be sent to Maputo.</p><h4>In terms of international investors coming in to contribute to the agricultural sector, what are the challenges and benefits?</h4><p>It is a matter of making the right decision. For example, we had to drop the prices of our rice 15% in November 2011 because the currency had appreciated by 30% and no one was buying it. Rice was suddenly expensive and people could access much cheaper rice that was imported. If you look at the neighboring countries of Tanzania, Uganda, and Kenya, to import rice you must pay a 70% duty. Mozambique has conditions like no other Southern African country in rice production, and we should have a surcharge of 10% to promote rice. Given that Southern Africa imports about $2 billion worth of rice per year, we should be able to take advantage of the situation and develop it.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does Tanween play in meeting increased demand for real estate in Qatar?<br></h4><p>We are a development management company that acts as a third party or owner-representative of projects. If an investor or a landowner has a project but does not know how to go forward or needs financing, we will provide a full turnkey solution. Through these services we achieve a key indicator, which is the reduction of time to market from inception until completion of the development. We start off with investment reports, business plans, feasibility studies, and market research in terms of absorption rates for supply and demand. The Tanween model shifted in 2008 after the crisis. We sat down and compared our work with that of neighboring countries and we knew we had to move away from speculative building and more toward a concrete business based on supply and demand. Now, there is a full due diligence process that needs to be complied with, which includes proper financial studies and business plans. As a very multinational company, we are able to attract the best talent from around the region and beyond. Tanween does business with about 40 different nationalities and plays the role of development consultant for Barwa. We have managed most of Barwa's projects during construction since late-2008. When we built enough internal capabilities and expertise, we then started to move toward being developers on our own. We did this by approaching people and clients who would be interested in leasing or selling their property or partnering with us to jointly develop land under joint ventures or build-operate-transfer (BOT) schemes. For example, we recently signed a major milestone for Tanween with an international player in the healthcare sector. We are building a hospital for a foreign operator that will enter the market as part of a 30-year program. We have also recently announced the creation of a real estate fund with our partners and shareholders, which we are calling, “The First Investor Tanween Fund." It will target investment and development in educational property. The company is putting together a plan to roll out new buildings and campuses for the education sector. We have worked for almost two years with Lusail and Qatari Diar in terms of advising in Lusail City, among other projects. We have also started bridging the gap between local small landlords and developers to help create more SMEs and developments through creating partnerships between opportunities and capital.</p><h4>What are some of the new projects that Tanween is going to be focusing on in the near future?</h4><p>In addition to our operations in Qatar, we have a project in Saudi Arabia. We are now focusing on Oman as a market, as it is starting to mature. We were looking at Egypt, but until things settle down in the rest of the Arab world, we are pretty much confined to Qatar specifically, and then Saudi Arabia and Oman in terms of our expansion plans. We have already moved into Saudi Arabia, and we have an office operating there in the eastern province. Our focus in Saudi Arabia is the development of housing projects. In Oman, we are looking mainly at development and project management opportunities. In Qatar, we are working on a hospital, which is a large investment, and three other transactions. One of them is a mixed-use development in the north with private owners. Another project we are working on is in the heart of Doha. We are developing different ideas for that location, centered on creating a cinema complex with a hotel and serviced apartments with retail space.</p><div class="quote">“A large amount of GCC money is coming into Doha, which is a sign of confidence."</div><h4>How important are Tanween's employees?</h4><p>In a business like ours, our people make our business. The simple reason is that the service we provide is a people's business. Our people are the biggest assets we have, and I am honestly proud of the team. The team makes Tanween what it is, and the day when our employees leave is the day that Tanween ceases to exist. It is as simple as that; I do not have a stock to sell. What we sell is expertise built over years and the combination of 50-80 years of experience, which comes from different backgrounds and expertise. We sell the intellectual property of our people.</p><h4>How would you describe the investment climate in the local construction sector?</h4><p>Qatar is where foreign investors are looking. The yields are still very attractive, although they have been tightened. Around 2011, we used to have yields that were 10% or 11%. This is not the case today, as we are seeing closer to 7.5%-8%. In another two or three years, we will see rates in Doha drop to around 5%-5.5%. The reason is that the demand is much greater than the supply, especially in the residential sector. A large amount of GCC money is coming into Doha, which is a sign of confidence. Many GCC companies are opening up branches and this has created a stimulus in the economy.</p><h4>What are your medium-term plans for Tanween?</h4><p>Our main focus is in education and health care, and this is where we are heading. We are looking at investing and participating in the development of healthcare and education facilities alongside our partners, and creating a pool of investors who are interested in Qatar as a whole. Saudi Arabia and Oman are our next focus outside of Doha. We believe that Doha is not oversaturated, but it is very important to study opportunities well before taking investment decisions.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Nearly 100% of Mozambique's electricity is provided by hydropower from Cahora Bassa. Energy exports made up 10.8% of the country's total and were valued at $299.5 million in 2011, an increase of 8.3% on 2010. What impact will Mozambique's growing energy demands have on its current export arrangements?</h4><p>Mozambique is a country with huge potential in generation, and we will fund our projects for domestic supply and also to export out of the region. We have had many meetings and people that want to sign agreements with Mozambique. The experience we had with Cahora Bassa was a long-term contract with the South African energy company Eskom until 2029. We need to make sure that as the country grows, we keep up. In five years' time, domestic consumption will grow so we will have to decrease our exports. This is something we will have to negotiate with our neighbors.</p><h4>Will Mozambique's power supply continue to rely solely on hydro in the future?</h4><p>Today, we are almost 100% hydropower from Cahora Bassa, but there is a small power station using natural gas. We are working to diversify this because it is always good to diversify power sources. I am pushing for this and it is good for the system. From Cahora Bassa to Nacala, it is almost 1,500 kilometers. For that distance, we need something to support and improve the supply. We need to increase the development of electricity. Today for Cahora Bassa, the line from Cahora Bassa to Nampula can easily supply 800 MW for the first 200 kilometers, but that decreases as you go further, and by the end you cannot put in more than 150 MW, even with more lines. The only way to develop that is to build more pipelines so gas can play a special role. Coal is another option. There are two scenarios, but there are difficulties in transportation.</p><h4>How important are public-private partnerships (PPPs) to boosting the supply gradient?</h4><p>At Electricidade de Moçambique (EDM), we are not in a position to construct every project. The only way to do that is to have a partnership that will help to establish this. If I want to build a power plant, I would rather go for a PPP with a utility company because once it joins, it would remain there for the next 20-30 years, which is good. If I bring a company in to be part of the business that then leaves in 5-10 years, it may make its revenue in a short time but it has an impact on the tariff. We favor PPPs with utilities that last longer. It creates revenue that lasts for many years. Taking concessions from public companies like EDM leads to possibilities and is also good to do.</p><h4>To what extent is EDM utilizing foreign loans to build power plants?</h4><p>The way that the country is growing, most projects are funded by industrial development agencies, and are not commercial. Today, we know that it is not easy to get this kind of funding for projects. We are not going to be able to repay high-interest loans though the tariff because the tariff will depreciate with new clients. We are going to continue to employ cheaper financing, although we know it will get harder. Most projects require lending so we need to move to access project finance. It is also good to prevent more expensive projects. We also need some ways to export energy, but we need to make sure the tariff for export is high enough to compensate.</p><h4>What targets do you have for distribution in the medium term?</h4><p>We have managed to connect all of the provinces on the grid and the challenge we face now is that the market is growing and we need to reinforce the lines. For instance, there is only one line to Nacala. We desperately need to do something in the next three or four years. The second line is ongoing and will cost about $450 million to build.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of Vale's Mozambique operation with respect to its global activities?</h4><p>Our strategy is to grow our core businesses, such as iron ore, coal, copper, nickel, and fertilizers. With regard to coal, Mozambique is our biggest operation and it's a very important project for us. On that account, we are happy to be celebrating one year since our first production. Besides some difficulties with the country's infrastructure, we are happy because we are succeeding. The issues regarding a greenfield project like this are challenging, but the environment in Mozambique is very positive, and the government and society welcome us. Mozambique was our first foray into Africa. The Inco acquisition was a landmark in Vale's international growth, and since 2007 and 2008 we have started to invest here and it has been a good learning process. It's amazing how we are progressing. It is encouraging not only for us, but for other companies investing in the region. We are developing a copper mine in Zambia, and we are also exploring Angola and Congo, for which Mozambique is a good platform.</p><h4>How can undertakings such as the Nacala Project leverage the growth of other sectors?</h4><p>We are carrying out the Nacala Project in partnership with Mozambique Ports and Railways (CFM), and it will surely leverage business for everybody. Vale is investing in infrastructure in partnership with other companies. It's an inclusive project meaning that other companies can have access to it, even in industries such as agriculture, forestry, and public transportation.</p><h4>What sort of conditions will other companies face to take advantage of the infrastructure that Vale is investing heavily in?</h4><p>We are basing ourselves on international benchmarking in terms of establishing a tariff system, which is important for us to make our coal operation feasible. Of course, infrastructure is linked with mining—reserves of any kind of minerals without infrastructure are worth nothing. For us at Vale, it is important to promote a system that allows us to produce our core, which is minerals, in such a way as to be able to share logistics costs with other companies fairly.</p><h4>What's the projected capacity of your operations?</h4><p>At present, we have 11 million tons in capacity. The bottleneck is the Sena line and the Port of Beira. However, we are doubling our capacity at the mine to 22 million tons. The Nacala Corridor will be completed in 2014, and by 2017 we will be exporting at full capacity. In 2012 we expect to export between 2.8 million and 3 million tons, and in 2013 we will improve on that. We started construction of the Malawian portion of the Nacala-Tete railway in January 2012, since it is the most critical point of the whole corridor. In fact, the distance from Tete to Nacala Velha is 912 kilometers, and of this about 230 kilometers is greenfield.</p><h4>Do you face any difficulties in crossing borders with regard to transport?</h4><p>No. Malawi and Mozambique have signed treaties regarding this matter and we fully trust in them. Besides, we believe that mining operations can serve as an anchor for railways and make them profitable, creating a business lever.</p><h4>What additional investment opportunities will Vale's investment in the Port of Nacala bring to the region?</h4><p>First of all, our investment in the Port of Nacala is to facilitate our coal exports. However, we know that once the infrastructure is there the door will be open to other investments. For example, if you also consider the gas that Mozambique has been discovering, the possibility to build other projects around the Port of Nacala becomes very high when both coal and gas are present. The port is geographically amazing. It is a protected bay and it is deep enough to allow the operation of large vessels. It will be completed early in 2015 in line with the rest of the Nacala Corridor. We are looking at investing about $1.1 billion in the port, while the whole corridor will cost around $4.5 billion to connect Tete to Nacala, including the port.</p><h4>What is the status of the proposed 600-MW thermal power plant at the Moatize Mine?</h4><p>We will probably do it in phases, implementing 300 MW in capacity over Phase I. The design is such that the capacity can be extended in modules. We are investing because it is important for our operation as well as for other demands.</p><h4>How has Vale responded to calls from the government to help develop the Mozambique Stock Exchange by floating 10% of the company?</h4><p>Vale, together with the government, is evaluating the possibility of selling 10% of its shares through the Mozambique Stock Exchange. However, there are other options being considered. More importantly, however, is the need to promote sustainable development. Around 85% of our manpower is hired and trained locally. Being a shareholder, an employee, a supplier, or a neighbor gives us the strength to overcome the challenges that society presents.</p><h4>How has Vale worked with Mozambican companies in Tete since 2004?</h4><p>As part of the first step of implementing activities in the country, we earmarked $1 billion to trade with local companies. We started with a very small number of companies, and the numbers have since been increasing. More than 500 Mozambican companies now supply us in different ways, fulfilling needs for transportation, accommodation, food and beverages, and all other kinds of service support. Also, we try to promote meetings and forums with our main suppliers and contractors and their local suppliers. It is one of Vale's policies to develop its local supplier network.</p><h4>What are your expectations for your Mozambican operations over the long term?</h4><p>We are very optimistic, even though it won't be easy. Investing $6.5 billion is never an easy task, especially with the lack of infrastructure here. However, every day we are improving and we feel more confident in the future.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How was the idea of Bank Nizwa formed and how successful has it been?<br></h4><p>The founders of the bank realized that many people have aspirations to integrate their economic life with their religious beliefs. In Oman, the rules state that in order to establish a bank, it is necessary to put a minimum of a 40% stake in the public domain. Since the founding partners decided to start the bank with OMR150 million, they needed to raise OMR60 million. The indication of having 11.3 times oversubscription tells you the depth of the demand for Islamic banking. We had 37,000 subscribers in the shareholding issue and received about OMR680 million. We had a soft launch on December 23, 2012, and after testing all our systems, we opened the bank to the public on January 10, 2013. Since our opening, the success of the bank has been positively overwhelming. It has surpassed our expectations.</p><h4>What has been the general response following Bank Nizwa's launch?</h4><p>We have been opening more than 100-150 accounts per day. We opened immediately with three branches: one in Muscat, one in Nizwa, and one in Sohar. The bank has received a huge number of visitors, and as we developed it to be one of the fastest in terms of opening accounts, we can complete the process in 10-15 minutes. This was a first in Oman. Nizwa Bank has made it possible to give clients a checkbook and ATM card before leaving the bank.</p><div class="quote">“There are many tools and instruments available in Islamic finance, ranging from the extreme pure trade to long-term equity."</div><h4>What advantage does the bank have as a first mover?</h4><p>There are advantages and disadvantages to our position. The advantage is that we have become the “talk of the town" and made history being the first Islamic bank in Oman. Moreover, we confirm our position given that a number of people still have doubts about whether or not they want to deal with Islamic banking windows rather than a full-fledged bank, although we see windows as a good temporary solution because it helps to create awareness about us and develops interbank relationships. The disadvantage is that we face a lot of pressure and expectations are high. We have to create awareness because while many people demand Islamic banking, some people still lack a solid understanding of its functions or what they can expect from us.</p><h4>How does Bank Nizwa promote Islamic finance?</h4><p>Aside from the fact that all of our products that are sharia compliant are fully explained to our clients, we aim to set the example of an ideal Islamic bank. Our campaign is thus both commercial and directed toward the spread of knowledge. The most important aspect of our campaigns is that they do not rely solely on media or newspapers. We run conferences for other groups that are specializing in offering Islamic finance. We have already scheduled dates with Sultan Qaboos University for lectures for graduates and undergraduates about Islamic banking. We have also been in touch with the banking college here to implement training programs. In order to ensure the best service, we put people through our own sharia training programs. We also offer a refresher course for five days per month to our staff.</p><h4>What are the fundamental differences between Islamic and conventional finance?</h4><p>There are many tools and instruments available in Islamic finance, ranging from the extreme pure trade to long-term equity. The fundamentals are that deals are based on sharia structures, although to some looking at it from the outside feel that they do look similar to conventional finance, which is not altogether true. Nevertheless, a number of the same goals are achieved. Customers regularly ask about the difference between profit margin and interest rate. Essentially, the contract that guides the relationship makes the difference. The contract specifically contains the obligations of both parties. It also defines the rights of both parties very clearly. The crucial difference is that Islamic finance is based on assets, and we cannot advance cash. However, we can buy commodities for clients or finance them in order to obtain a product from which they can benefit, be it a car, house, or equipment for a production unit. This is why when the global crisis took hold in 2008, there was a swell of interest in Islamic finance, with many questioning whether it is better for an economy because it is more stable and based on actual assets.</p><h4>How are you looking to expand the penetration of Islamic finance?</h4><p>We are trying to work as fast as possible to expand geographically and reach more people. During the IPO road show, we interacted with people in different cities and villages. We could see from people's questions that the market was looking forward to this opportunity. That is where the Islamic banking windows could help. Some of Oman's conventional banks have windows, and they can say that tomorrow 10 of their branches are becoming Islamic. This means that it is possible for them to reach people and build a network quickly. Before our first year of operation ends, we are working to establish another five branches. Every year, we will work to open five or six new branches, depending on our ability to find the right location and people. The most important aspect of our work is our staff; we are training and preparing them to welcome, receive, and serve the clients. Islamic banking is intended to be a full-fledged banking service. Trade finance and consumer finance are only single activities, but there is also corporate banking and investment banking, which is the nature of the business. We have already been granted the license to practice investment banking.</p><h4>How has the government encouraged the early development of the Islamic finance industry?</h4><p>We have benefitted from certain relaxations in the normal regulations for banks in Oman. The Central Bank of Oman (CBO) has allowed us to invest up to 75% of our net worth in foreign currency-denominated assets in our first six months and up to 50% in the subsequent six months, which is against the normal 40% ceiling for banks. If the regulatory authorities believe in Islamic financing, which we believe they do, they have to help it to grow and make sure that it's a successful exercise.</p><h4>Where do you believe your customers will come from?</h4><p>Considering Oman in general, the total banking penetration rate is 14%, compared to about 20% in the other Gulf states. This shows that there is a certain population outside of the banking sector. The question remains whether they are simply too conservative to utilize the conventional banking services currently offered. We also know from our relationships with other banks that there is a lot of Omani money deposited in neighboring countries' Islamic banks. We expect that money to come back into the Omani economy at some stage. We believe there will be three sources of new Islamic finance in the Omani banking sector: money that will return from banks overseas, money that will be generated from conservative individuals who were previously outside the reach of the banking sector, and those in the conventional banking sector that may switch.</p><h4>How important is technology going to be for the success of Bank Nizwa?</h4><p>Technology is crucial because we want to persuade people that Islamic banking is a sophisticated industry as well. Time is very important in Islam. Some people are relaxed about it, but that is a social habit. As a religious discipline, it is very important. If you want to conduct transactions that meet people's expectations, there must be a level of sophistication. When addressing the younger generation, we are aware that they are more adaptable and will prefer to use modern technology such as internet banking.</p><h4>What role will Islamic banking play in Oman's sustainable economic development?</h4><p>Islamic banking relies on a system of development rather than the rentier economy, where people borrow and lend money for more money. Islamic finance is involved in a deeper level of the economy—particularly equity participation—from supporting SMEs to advancing production sectors. I am sure that we will be playing a very important role in sustainable economic development.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role do you see international investors playing in Mozambique's long-term economic development?</h4><p>Mozambique has become a prime destination for investment. Foreign companies started in the country by looking for opportunities in coal and natural gas. Since then, we have been welcoming investors from around the world. Now, we are raising awareness that Mozambique is not all about coal and gas. The country boasts other business opportunities in agriculture, energy, and infrastructure. Due to our privileged geographical position, we have corridors that provide access to landlocked parts of Africa. In coal and gas, there are opportunities beyond production, especially in the downstream chain and logistical backbone. One of the reasons investors come to Mozambique is the stability the country enjoys; we have macro-economic, political, and social stability. These are key attractions for any investor and boost our own development.</p><h4>Has Mozambique met its FDI targets? What are your goals for 2013?</h4><p>We've been successful in meeting our targets each year. Our FDI has reached levels of between $1 billion and $1.8 billion annually, not including coal and gas. We are now aiming for $3 billion in FDI across the spectrum. Huge public investments have been made to overcome the infrastructure deficit. Our projects include the power transmission “backbone" from north to south and a hydropower generation facility in the north of the country. Regarding logistics, we have plans to build railways that provide support for the transportation of coal mining. These projects are valued at around $6 billion.</p><h4>What are your main priorities in the medium term?</h4><p>Our top priority is to invest in agriculture, because more than 70% of our people are living in rural areas and are engaged in the sector. The second top priority area for Mozambique is vocational training. We have several projects geared toward capacity building. The preservation of national unity will rely on a great deal of engagement from our citizens. This participation will depend on the development of their skills. A third priority is infrastructure: access roads, national highways, and rural roads that can ensure the movement of both people and goods in the country. The current coverage of the national grid is 36%—we need to see more Mozambicans enjoying the benefits of power. Production levels will also increase with greater access to electricity. A fourth priority for us is investment in the healthcare sector, where we are mainly addressing child mortality and endemic diseases.</p><div class="quote">“Our top priority is to invest in agriculture, because more than 70% of our people are living in rural areas and are engaged in the sector."</div><h4>What is the significance of the Zambezi Valley project for improved agricultural development and investment?</h4><p>It is said, “He who owns the Zambezi Valley has every resource." We have been focusing on the Zambezi Valley because the region has the potential to become the breadbasket for the country and its neighbors. The specific mission for our agency is to conduct technical and feasibility studies, as well as provide support for the government as it identifies fundraising projects, gathers financial resources, and dedicates investments to the provinces. For example, we have a basin in Moatize where coal is exported from ports such as Beira or Nacala. We believe that the communities living along those railways can also benefit from the existence of that infrastructure, instead of just watching trains go back and forth. The members of each community should also be able to ship goods to any of those business hubs. Our agency aims to encourage the government to approach infrastructure planning in a global and integrated way.</p><h4>To what extent are development funds from BRIC countries important to Mozambique's development?</h4><p>Most of our funding comes from the World Bank, the African Development Bank, and Europe. However, considering the crisis in Europe, we realized a need to access other sources of funding. In seeking other sources, we have discussed opportunities to work with the BRICs—except Russia, a country that has not initiated donations  to Africa yet. We have been enjoying great support when it comes to funding, but in a country like ours it is advisable also to look for concessional funding. Therefore, we have to strike a balance between concessional and non-concessional loans.</p><h4>How will funds from coal and gas exports be used to create sustainable development across the country?</h4><p>We have been blessed with the discovery of new resources in 2012. In addition, we have the Congo, Liberia, and Angola to learn from; our agency will focus on avoiding previous mistakes to ensure that the resources in Mozambique are being used for the country's development. The resource management team should act in line with the will of the government and the country. That will challenge us in terms of legislation, especially as we work to ensure transparency in the extractive industries. Our focus is on the management of resources that will begin pumping funds into the state budget.</p><h4>How is the Ministry of Planning and Development working to encourage international investors to develop value-added products in Mozambique for export?</h4><p>When companies come here, their flagship is to provide support to the government—but at the end of the day, they are here to maximize their profits. This means that the government of Mozambique is working to enforce legislation that ensures that these activities are benefitting the country. In this way, Mozambique will not be exporting raw materials, but instead adding value locally. This processing will add value to the economy and provide more jobs, which will generate more revenue and engage local companies downstream and boost profits. We are working toward that goal.</p><h4>What specific incentives are in place to encourage value-added production?</h4><p>We offer favorable tax incentives for private investments. In terms of natural resources, these tax measures are lowered. In the post-war period, we had to provide a lot of tax advantages to Mozal, which became a kind of calling card to present to other countries and painted a picture of Mozambique as an investment-friendly country with a positive environment for investors. For current investments, we enforce a regulatory framework based on established international standards. Special tax incentives for goods that are produced exclusively for export still exist. To this end, there are also special economic zones (SEZs) and industrial free zones in the country. There is definitely no company, megaproject, or natural resources production activity that will become duty free.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the success of these zones in encouraging companies to come to Mozambique and launch value-added production?</h4><p>These zones are experiencing excellent growth. We have experience with Nacala, which is seeing growth in terms of FDI and local investment levels. We operate an industrial park close to the smelter, which is also enjoying substantial growth. In summer 2012, we established another duty-free industrial area in Beira. This zone aims to provide logistics for hinterland countries, and has demonstrated remarkable growth. In 2010, we made an initial investment of $5 million in the SEZs. The project has shown promising results, and we are very hopeful that there will be many more investments in the future.</p><h4>What level of involvement does Mozambique have within the Southern African Development Community (SADC) infrastructure plan?</h4><p>Without Mozambique, this infrastructure development plan would not be in place. The majority of the beneficiary countries are landlocked, and therefore rely on us. We consider it our responsibility to increase the quality of services we provide to landlocked countries. Following the approval of the SADC infrastructure plan in Maputo, it has become much easier to raise funding both locally and throughout Africa as a whole, as well as from the African Development Bank and from our multilateral partners. This project was carried out because Mozambique is enjoying a competitive economic advantage. We aim to raise approximately $10 billion for the SADC as a whole, a figure that is required for the improvement of infrastructure. This will ensure that the SADC countries run smoothly in the forthcoming years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>To what extent will special economic zones be the engine of Mozambique's economic growth?<br></h4><p>We started to approve projects in 2009, and some of them are entering into production this year. Many projects are still in the construction phase, and we are focused on building factories and importing the needed capital equipment. We will probably see the effect of these special economic zone (SEZ) projects in the next three to four years. We are also expecting more foreign investment that will contribute substantially to the economy, because we are talking about industries and services that are not related to anything that is already here.</p><h4>Which sectors are being targeted for investment in the Nacala SEZ?</h4><p>The SEZs are for a wide range of activities, from industry and agro-business to services. We are promoting investment in tourism, and there are also areas for heavy industries such as iron ore, fertilizer plants, and chemical plants for gas in Nacala Velha, at the other side of the bay, as well as areas on the south side of the bay where we are promoting more assembly lines for electronics. Current indications show that there is very strong participation from agribusinesses in Nacala. We are in a region that produces many things, and we are mainly promoting agro-business because we are close to a port, and we also aim to increase exports as well.</p><h4>How would you characterize the size and source of agribusiness investment?</h4><p>More than 60% of the investment as a whole is national. From that, around half is agro-business. Foreign investment will grow, and we expect it to become larger than the national investment pool. The top contributors of foreign investment are Portugal, Tanzania, and China. The projects that have been approved since 2009 are all small and medium sized, ranging anywhere up to $15 million.</p><h4>What sort of industry are you expecting to set up shop in Beluluane Industrial Park, the industrial free zone near Maputo?</h4><p>Beluluane Industrial Park was created to support Mozal, and until now 90% of the businesses located in that area support Mozal; some 25 of the 26 companies working in the park are working with Mozal. Export-oriented industries have not yet been developed there. In 2012, a new company was established independently from Mozal, and that is the only company in the industrial free zone that is producing and exporting. At present, we are in the process of improving the management structure of the park. There are about 700 hectares of land available, but only 50 hectares have been utilized so far. Much of the land has not been used since 2001. There are two types of industry that we are looking to target. In the northern part of the park there is land that was reserved for heavy industry like cement factories. Some of this land has already been purchased. It is also reserved for some industries that are using aluminum as a raw material from Mozal, and there are also some companies that are electricity-intensive. On the east side of the park, we aim to develop several assembly lines based on the competencies of the companies we are working with.</p><h4>How does Gazeda work with the airport authorities to plan how best to link the SEZs with transportation infrastructure?</h4><p>All the transportation studies that have been made in Nacala's SEZs are going through Gazeda. We have completed two feasibility studies in partnership with our Japanese counterparts on the area rehabilitation and expansion of the port that was made here in partnership with a Japanese firm. This study has finished, and we are securing funds for its rehabilitation from Japan. Gazeda is seeking investment in infrastructure, and we are a part of the negotiations, including the Ministry of Transport.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What kind of investments are you looking at in Africa?</h4><p><strong>ALP MALAZGİRT</strong> The four sectors that we have experience in are mining, port operations, energy, and fertilizers. If there is any region where you can include all four of those sectors, it is Africa. It needs fertilizer and it needs huge amounts of energy. There are many mining opportunities and port operations. We want to focus on these four sectors and then scale up, using the technology we have and our own know-how. That is the reason why West Africa really fits the bill for us. With the office we have opened in Gabon, and the ones soon to open in South Africa and in East Africa, we will call it the “golden triangle," which will capture all the opportunities we see in Africa.</p><p><strong>ROBERT YÜKSEL YILDIRIM</strong> Our strategy in Africa is different from our strategy in Latin America. We go directly business to business in Latin America; in Africa, we go directly to the government. We want to set up joint ventures with government entities. That way we don't look like foreigners coming in to take advantage of Africa. As a Turkish company, we want to take on a different model than Chinese companies. Africans are getting tired of the Chinese; they make investments in countries, but they bring in Chinese workers. We are informing all the ministries that we want to bring the finance and the know-how; however, we also want to employ local people.</p><h4>What do you see as the most attractive investment opportunities in Mozambique?</h4><p><strong>RYY</strong> Mozambique is interesting for us because it has coal, which means mining opportunities. It also has gas, which is the fuel for fertilizer. We know energy already, which the country also needs to expand and to export to its neighbors. Mozambique has a long coastline, meaning there are many ports and opportunities. When the investment comes, there will be a lot of exports from Mozambique, and it will need gateway ports. Our own shipping company will be able to cover our logistical needs when exporting or importing overseas, and that is why we are paying attention to Mozambique. Another advantage of Mozambique is that it is a gateway for landlocked countries in the area, such as Malawi and Zimbabwe.</p><p><strong>A</strong><strong></strong><strong>M</strong> Mozambique is a country that is developing; however, Colombia is semi-developed. Rio Tinto is producing coal in Mozambique, and it is setting up the infrastructure for its operations. We are a small company, relatively speaking, so we are more interested in so-called “brownfield" projects rather than “greenfield" projects. We need countries where there is enough development so there is a choice among junior-sized companies. In Colombia, the coal business has been around for a long time, and it is mainly small enterprises doing business. Only a few of these will be big enough and strong enough to do business with; however, Mozambique doesn't have that goal yet.</p><h4>Is it difficult to come in and compete with the large-scale companies in Mozambique such as Vale and Rio Tinto?</h4><p><strong>RYY</strong> These are major companies; Rio Tinto and Vale are in the top five. We are not in the top five, so we need to know our scale. We cannot go and fight with the heavyweights because we will get knocked down immediately. We are looking for junior mining companies that we can provide some value-added. The project size needs to be something that we can chew. We don't want it to be too big and then lose everything at the end. We need to be very selective and find the right project for our size. We need something that we can develop so it will be attractive to investors and becomes a target either for M&amp;A or so we can decide to have an IPO.</p><h4>To what extent does Mozambique present Yıldırım Group the opportunity to implement its “one-stop-shop" strategy with regards to energy, logistics, and shipping?</h4><p><strong>AM</strong> Mozambique presents Yıldırım Group an incredible opportunity to implement this “one-stop-shop" strategy because the country has all the right ingredients for Yıldırım Holding to be most effective. It has vast mineral and coal resources, that need to be mined, and it has a long shoreline and only a few ports that need development to ship overseas for valuable foreign exchange. Because Mozambique is a developing country with limited resources, Yıldırım Holding can bring a suite of huge benefits of having just one company and one entity to deal with to provide a full range of services, which are comprised of port operations, port construction, mining, coal transport and logistics, building mine-mouth power plants, and fertilizer production and distribution. Imagine the amount of time—not to mention the valuable human resources and dollars—Mozambique can save by dealing only with Yıldırım as its one-stop solution provider, instead of dealing with a plethora of companies from different countries.</p><h4>What is the scale of the investment you anticipate in Mozambique?</h4><p><strong>AM</strong> There is no set scale or number that we have reserved for Mozambique. However, we have clearly defined the areas that we would like to invest in and form partnerships with other companies and/or the Mozambican government on these projects. The chosen four areas of strategic growth fit like a glove into Mozambique's long-term growth plans, which are in mining, energy, fertilizer, and port operations.</p><h4>To what extent does Mozambique have the potential to become West Africa's key shipping hub?</h4><p><strong>AM</strong> I feel that Mozambique has a unique position, because of its the geography and at this juncture in the history of global trade, to become East Africa's key shipping port because firstly it occupies over 1,300 miles of the eastern coast along southern Africa, and secondly that it acts as a significant transport corridor door for four landlocked African countries with vast mineral, natural, and human resources. Finally, it has its own rich natural resources that will be used for exports to assist in the growth of the country. With all this, it behoves the country leaders not to make substantial investments in port development and port operations. Certainly, the Port of Maputo is of international stature and the Port of Beira is developing. However, there is still a dire need for more ports and efficiency enhancements. With the addition of Gemport and Rotaport into its portfolio of ports in the Sea of Marmara, Turkey, and also having the ownership of 50% of one of the biggest transhipment hubs in the world, Malta Freeport, Yıldırım Group is well poised to assist in an ambitious plan to develop, construct, and operate Mozambique's “window to the world."</p><h4>How significant is Africa in general, and Mozambique in particular, to Yıldırım Group's global portfolio?</h4><p><strong>AM</strong> Yıldırım Group operates in more than 10 sectors, and in each and every sector it is one of the top players either in Turkey or globally. The company also has ambitions to become more global and grow in those sectors that it has the expertise, a track record of transformational change, and synergistic know-how. Mozambique, on the other hand, has the natural resources and a young population and is desirous to grow economically. We feel that there are many areas in which we can work and cooperate. Clearly at the top of this list is port construction and operations, importing coal to fuel energy power plants anywhere in the world, assisting in Mozambique's ambitious plans in exploring and developing minerals, mines, and metallurgical smelting, and also assisting in the promotion, production, manufacturing, and distribution of much-needed fertilizer to support its agricultural base.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[On the Value Chain]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[on-the-value-chain]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you describe the evolution of the Oman Gas Company (OGC) since 2005?</h4><p>The company was established in 2000, when it took over the pipeline transportation business from PDO at that time. The pipelines were about 900 kilometers long and we had a handful of gas consumers at that time. As of today, we have 43 gas consumer points in the country. We have almost tripled our pipeline length, we added three compression stations on the pipelines, and we are still expanding the pipeline network. OGC has evolved from a gas transportation company to a more complex gas transportation and gas value chain focus. Our largest consumer, sector-wise, is power and water. Second comes industry, and that consists of large industrial users, like the methanol, fertilizer, steel, cement, and refinery sectors, and then a good percentage of our gas goes to oil operations.</p><h4>How much gas did you deliver overall in 2012?</h4><p>In 2012, the average daily delivery was around 42 million cubic meters a day by OGC. Our system capacity is in fact more than 60 million cubic meters per day. We have a five-year plan, and we know where the bottlenecks will be. To conduct these reviews we have a network simulation, and we receive gas demand projections from the Ministry of Oil and Gas, which is crucial. There is a lot of interaction and cooperation with the Ministry.</p><h4>What level of reliability does OGC operate under?</h4><p>We have a very high level of reliability. In 2012, we were at 99.997%, which means that we only had a 0.003% interruption rate. We do not distinguish between large and small consumers, but if you shut down a big consumer the economic impact is greater. We have had a high reliability rate across our operations since 2005, and we have not fallen below 99.99% of gas availability in the network.</p><h4>From where is your gas sourced?</h4><p>We get our gas from four producers currently: PDO block 6, which accounts for about 70% of gas production, and then the other 30% comes from Oxy's Safah field, PTTEP, and the Dolphin Gas import project. On average, we import about 5.5 million cubic meters per day from Dolphin, which is approximately 12% of our total supply. It is important that you do not depend on one gas supplier, especially in a country like Oman where we are heavily reliant on gas, and our gas network is quite diversified geographically. We have been dependent not only upon Dolphin Gas, but other producers like PTTEP and Oxy, especially if we have significant gas interruptions from other producers. The Dolphin connection is the first cross-GCC connection, and now we are importing Qatari gas through the UAE. That is the type of good cooperation we would like to see, especially when you talk about gas networks, electricity networks, and other forms of cooperation.</p><h4>Do you provide any consultancy services for companies looking to explore for gas in Oman?</h4><p>We do and we help them. We have been providing some consultancy services, especially for the newcomers to Oman, helping them to understand the gas infrastructure, the business, and the opportunities, where to tie in their plants and pipelines, and sometimes we help them on the pipeline design itself. We also provide feedback on where we can optimize the gas value chain in the country. We have a strong relationship with the Ministry of Oil and Gas, and we advise its officials and they consult us on gas-related issues. We also consult them on gas value opportunities, which has been successful, and we now have projects in the pipeline.</p><div class="quote">“OGC has evolved from a gas transportation company to a more complex gas transportation and gas value chain focus. "</div><h4>How do you envisage gas prices changing in coming years?</h4><p>The price has already changed for major consumers, and the country has to follow international trends. However, for new industries, the government has put in place a different set of gas prices, and that is in line with international trends. Of course, the rise of unconventional or tight gas will mean our supply will cost much more. If we go more unconventional, drill deeper, then we perhaps will need fracking technology and the price will go higher.</p><h4>How much of the manufacturing and design process for pipelines is OGC involved in?</h4><p>We do the feasibility and front-end design in-house, and that is to control our specifications. The pipes themselves come from outside, from China, Europe, and India, and then the local contractors are involved in the EPC part of the project.</p><h4>Where is your focus regionally?</h4><p>One of our largest consumer bases is Sohar, followed by Muscat, and the third region in terms of volume consumption is Salalah. Currently, we have about 320 employees across our headquarters and five operational regions, all the way from Muscat down to Salalah. We will start operations in Sur soon in 2013.</p><h4>How will the Duqm development affect OGC?</h4><p>We are gearing up for it. We are building the largest capacity pipeline in OGC down to Duqm, just to be ready for the Duqm development. We are quite busy on the Duqm pipeline now and I hope we will be the first main infrastructure to arrive at Duqm.</p><h4>Can you tell us about your Omanization initiatives?</h4><p>In April 2013 we reached two years without a lost time incident (LTI). We are doing very well, as is the case with any company that strives in Oman. The concern is road traffic and accidents, and we have been unlucky sometimes with accidents; however, we have succeeded in reaching two years without an LTI, and that is a good record on the safety side. We also have ISO certification in all the different aspects of health and safety, and quality. We are also doing very well from the environmental perspective because we do not flare gas, we only do so when there is an emergency in the compressor station. We are one of the cleanest oil and gas companies in the country. With regard to Omanization, we stand at 95% in the company, with many departments already scoring 100%. Training and development is very important to retain staff.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the gas industry in Oman?</h4><p>Our outlook, starting with OGC itself, will be focusing not only on expanding our gas network, but focusing on optimizing the gas value chain. Meaning, we may be burning a lot of good energy. We are currently giving it to partners to burn, for example, in their gas turbines. We want to start focusing on the extraction of these liquids and make use of its benefits. We have already secured an agreement with the Ministry of Oil and Gas and the Ministry of Finance to implement an LPG project located in Salalah, because we see economical volumes of LPG coming into our pipeline network. We will be building an almost 800 ton per day LPG plant down in Salalah, where we are very active. We are currently in discussions with the Salalah Free Zone and the Salalah Port on the location of the plant and storage facilities, and I hope to follow this with other projects in other parts of the country. In Oman, I think that OCG will continue to grow and there will continue to be growth in gas demand as the government looks favorably at projects that require gas and the value aspect associated with it. This includes the in-country value, which is becoming very important and includes employment. It is not only the volumes, the economics, or the revenue aspects, but it is also how much in-country value the project can bring, the volume of gas that it requires, and the type of employment opportunities it generates. I expect that the government will be focusing more on these three areas. I think the government will be releasing gas to more projects and so there will be a growth in gas-based industries in Oman.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has your experience in France helped you in your role to transform Cape Verde into a tourist destination and hub?<br></h4><p>I was an ambassador to France for eight years, and at the same time I was a multi-lateral ambassador to UNESCO. I also represented Cape Verde in the development committee at the OECD. It was a very interesting experience because Paris is an important diplomatic city, where almost all of the world's countries are represented. It is a large diplomatic forum, and it was rewarding because being in Paris provides cultural, social, and diplomatic rewards. From France, I participated mostly in PR activity and gained experience. As an ambassador in France, there is always a lot of PR to do: contacts, conferences, and dossiers. Dubai is a center of international trade and investment and it is a very important travel hub, connecting all parts of the world. It connects the strong arm of the Emirates. We came here to gain experience and knowledge and contact prospective investors for the same model we want to build in Cape Verde. It is a small archipelago with 10 islands that has turned to services. We want to be a service platform in the mid-Atlantic part of the world. We are one hour from the west coast of Africa, three hours from Brazil, three-and-a-half hours from Portugal and Spain, and six hours from the US. We want to take advantage of our strategic location to build a service platform for the region. That is why one of the objectives is to create an aerial hub. That is what has brought us to Dubai; to begin to approach prospective investors and build an important aerial hub for passengers and cargo. We want to position ourselves as a financial center that can attract investment.</p><h4>What is it about Cape Verde that is attractive?</h4><p>Tourism is the main attraction. We have natural conditions that accommodate several segments of tourism, such as beautiful beaches and a mountainous landscape. We have a very interesting tourism package offer that is already presenting tourism as the main sector for the government. Tourism represents almost 25% of the nation's GDP, and we definitely want to transform Cape Verde into a tourism destination. The sector is already consolidated and that is the future of Cape Verde. The country enjoys year-round warm and sunny weather, and is therefore an all-year holiday destination. The cultural diversity and harmony of the islands make Cape Verde a unique place in the world. It is also known for its social peace and political and economic stability. Its steady economic growth over recent years coupled with social cohesion and prosperity ensure Cape Verde's continuing development.</p><div class="quote">“The cultural diversity and harmony of the islands make Cape Verde a unique place in the world."</div><h4>What steps are you taking to attract more investment?</h4><p>We are working to brand the country. It is unwise to market the country worldwide without a brand. We believe that in the next couple of months we will have our brand, and then we will begin to sell the country worldwide. In this part of the world, we have much work to do. We are better known in Europe because our main sources of financing are from there. There is much investment required, but we are confident that we will be better known in a few years. In view of the importance of foreign investment as a source of sustenance for economic growth, the government of Cape Verde has taken a series of policy measures to encourage FDI flows into tourism, manufacturing, offshore banking and financial services, IT, communications, and fishing. As far as foreign investors are concerned, Cape Verde offers itself as an attractive destination because of several positive features such as political stability, strategic location, availability of skilled labor, and investment-friendly rules and institutions. After following a sustained growth path over the last three decades based on tourism and international services, Cape Verde is now shifting gears to move toward a higher stage of economic development. Our goal is to consolidate the country's position as a premier regional and international hub. FDI has played an important role in the development of Cape Verde, and will again be decisive when the country is embarking on high value-added, capital intensive, and knowledge-based activities.</p><h4>How did the partnership with Capital Consulting come about?</h4><p>The government has been supportive of the project proposed to us by Capital Consulting. Associated with naseba, Capital Consulting is aiming to promote a major air hub initiative in Cape Verde. We are supporting the project and preparing the conditions for its success, but everything depends on a private-public partnership (PPP) down the road. At this point in time, the government has give all of its support to Capital Consulting and naseba to promote the project.</p><h4>What can an investor from Dubai offer to Cape Verde?</h4><p>Being in Dubai is a very interesting strategy that will attract private investors. We have already contacted a number of potential partners, and the first reactions have been very positive. Dubai understands our strategy and people are willing to proceed with us until each project is complete. We are still in the first phase of the project, which is to sell the idea of our air hub initiative. It is something that we are promoting, but we want to discuss and find the right strategic partner before marketing it worldwide.</p><h4>What kind of impact will this project have on the country?</h4><p>It will have a major impact because it will help us consolidate the service platform that we are seeking to build in the country. We are already developing a maritime hub, and an aerial edition will complement our ongoing work. Everything in the country will be better positioned strategically in our part of the world. This work will also create jobs. At this point in time, we are beginning to promote and present the overall strategy. Another strategy we are interested in is the development of the IT sector.</p><h4>What are your plans for the medium term?</h4><p>In six months' time, we will be able to structure the first phase. This is a long-term project that will require at least 15-30 years of work to reach its final stage. We are creating the conditions and working to attract the right investors to join the project.</p><h4>Are there any partners you have in mind?</h4><p>We are not ready to discuss any specific partners because we are still working on the first phase of our strategy. However, we are in negotiations with several prospective interested parties. The project has attracted interest from people in the UAE and Europe, where we already have strategic partnerships with major groups that are interested. It is also possible that Cape Verde could become part of a strategic and economic platform for Singaporean companies for business in the mid-Atlantic region, particularly in West Africa. Singaporean companies are most welcomed because there are numerous opportunities in tourism and leisure, aquaculture, and transatlantic maritime services such as port management, bunkering, and transshipment. There are also opportunities for a strategic partnership in developing synergies on air and maritime traffic and economically profitable activities and operations.</p><h4>How do you describe Cape Verde to potential investors?</h4><p>Clearly, Cape Verde is a country with attractive investment incentives and a strategic location. There is also investor protection and safety with good market access. In addition to this safe, secure, stable and profitable business environment, the developed financial service sector in the country is yet another attractive facet of our country. Our workforce is skilled and available for new projects and challenging work, and the institutional support offered by the government has been streamlined to be a “one-stop shop" for investors.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the Investment Promotion Centre (CPI) contributed to Mozambique's economic growth?</h4><p>Even before the coal and gas boom, Mozambique was an attractive place for business thanks to the commitment of the government to the business community. CPI was set up in 1985 during the transition to a free market economy. Our business environment had further developed by 1993, so we updated the investment center to introduce a new model. The new strategy focused on growth. The World Bank predicted that Mozambique would not grow more than 4% during the global financial crisis in 2008, but we surpassed this prediction. The crisis did not affect business—the agricultural sector even expanded. After Mozambique was cleared of landmines in 2007, people who were living in neighboring countries started to return. The growth strategy was strongly supported by President Chissano and then by President Guebuza. Mozambique has also made a commitment to overcoming poverty. In this sense, CPI plays an important role in the country's economic growth. CPI facilitates business for different sectors. In addition to tourism and agribusiness, Mozambique has a need for experts in a variety of fields in order to build its human capital. We are working with Portugal and the UK in this regard. We are in the process of setting out a roadmap for the next 20 years, which will make us one of the leading countries in Africa.</p><h4>Mozambique fell seven places in the World Bank's Doing Business rankings in 2012 to 139. How can you reassure investors that Mozambique will improve its business climate in 2013?</h4><p>This is a big concern, and it is being taken extremely seriously across all levels of government. CPI has advised the government, in terms of investment, that we have to develop a united strategy for national promotion. The main strategy to improve the business environment is guided by the Ministry of Industry and Trade. In terms of national promotion, we need to build a network to ensure all agencies are working together and coordinating strategy. Today, CPI is speaking the same language as the Ministry of Tourism and the Ministry of Agriculture's promotion directorates, INATUR and CEPAGRI, instead of competing with one another.</p><h4>How is CPI collaborating with partner agencies to promote investment in Mozambique?</h4><p>CPI started with a roadshow in partnership with the Ministry of Energy. We represent CPI and the Ministry of Energy when we travel. From this we are able to direct investors more efficiently. We are working with investors from Brazil and Portugal to build a light rail to connect Matola and Maputo. This needs to be coordinated between the Ministry of Transport and the Ministry of Energy. We have developed numerous strategies, many of which remain to be implemented. CPI has presented its strategy to the Ministry of Planning and Development for the period from 2013 to 2030. In this plan, we identified our priorities and strategic objectives for investment and economic cooperation. We plan to canvass the country to raise awareness of our programs and bring the key stakeholders together. The center is working to build an efficient network with coordination between all ministries and agencies. All international companies come through CPI. There is no way to do business in Mozambique without CPI. If companies go directly to the relevant ministry, they will be referred to CPI. Some companies have even gone straight to the president or prime minister, but these investors are also redirected to CPI.</p><div class="quote">“We are working with investors from Brazil and Portugal to build a light rail to connect Matola and Maputo."</div><h4>What types of support does CPI offer to foreign investors?</h4><p>CPI's critical role is facilitation. We travel abroad to inform investors about opportunities to invest in Mozambique. Once they arrive, we track their progress, and we even help investors when they arrive at the airport going to the hotel. Our staff understands their needs and assists them in establishing businesses and making investments. If an investor wants to purchase land, lease property, set up a company, or hire services, we can assist. We help  guide investors through customs and immigration procedures. CPI also issues letters of invitation for additional investors. The center has direct access at the highest levels—I am in direct contact with the ministers, and we are able to bring issues to them immediately. This is the benefit of strong ties between the private sector and government. We meet frequently, identify constraints to business and development, and find solutions. Our door is open all day to facilitate the needs of investors, free of charge.</p><h4>Which sectors offer the most opportunity for priority investment in 2013?</h4><p>We need to build up infrastructure and logistics; the transport network, trade companies, and industrial parks add value to the coal and gas sector. We are promoting that in every province; every region needs an industrial park. In Cabo Delgado, for example, we are working with Anadarko to create an industrial hub for gas. We also need to work up the value chain in the agricultural sector. The South African supermarket chain Pick n Pay is working with CPI to evaluate which products can be sourced inside Mozambique instead of the border town of Nelspruit. Currently, it ships fresh produce by plane to Cabo Delgado. This model is inefficient and wasteful, so it is working with the Ministry of Agriculture to source products that can be grown and delivered from the planned Nacala Corridor. It is at the heart of the agricultural strategy to ensure produce can get to the markets. There are plenty of opportunities for agro-business, and food security is critical. Mozambique still needs processing plants, fertilizer companies, and investments in energy plants. The tourism sector is also rich in opportunities thanks to our beautiful beaches and fantastic wildlife.</p><h4>What are your expectations for FDI in the medium term?</h4><p>CPI has several applications for investment involving mega-projects. Anadarko has indicated that it plans to invest $8 billion in a gas logistics hub. Vale has also promised $8 billion to build infrastructure not only to aid the shipment of coal, but also to benefit the whole country. The railway through Zambézia will also stimulate the local economy. Another example is the successful Mozambique Development Corridor. This area used to be rural, and now there are many villages and a functioning economy with industrial development. The pro-savannah hub project totals $5 billion in investment. We expect to double the overall figure of FDI within five years. We are confident, despite the challenging business environment. Mozambique has more than 7% economic growth, but it is more important to talk about economic development. Construction, services, and mega projects will boost economic growth, but we need sustainable development, which will take 20 years. FDI is very important to bridge the gap, but we have to also build up the local capacity to invest. The key is joint ventures. We work with Mozambicans to invest here. We will follow the Namibian model, where it is a must to have a local partner.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How extensive are Grupo Synergy E&amp;P's operations in Latin America?</h4><p>We currently have operations in two different mature fields in Ecuador; one in the Santa Elena Peninsula and another in Eastern Ecuador at the Tiguino field. We also have operations in Colombia—a small condensate gas field for which we have been granted exploitation and operations rights for 20 years with a very ambitious investment plan. In Brazil, we operate in three different states: Bahia, Rio Grande do Norte, and Alagoas. Returning to Ecuador, we have recently renegotiated our contracts due to changes in the hydrocarbons law in 2010. These contracts are set to expire in 2016. In this regard, we are holding talks to extend one of the contracts, especially in the Santa Elena Peninsula, until 2029. This particular field is very mature, and it has been exploited for 100 years already. We currently produce 1,240 barrels per day (bbl/d). We have been operating in this field since 2002, with 1,463 wells and around 345 staff in that field. The new operating and investment plan for this field foresees a $56 million investment in order to drill approximately 30 wells before the current contract expires. At the same time, we are to carry 2D and 3D seismic studies that will determine future developments in the field. Regarding the Tiguino field, we have been operating there since 2004 and current production figures are 3,400 bbl/d with 13 productive wells and around 123 staff in that field. Thanks to high levels of investment in Tiguino, we have recovery levels of around 25%, which are above the average. Our exploitation contract in this field expires in 2016, and we are in the process renegotiating with the government to extend this contract with our company.</p><h4>How significant is your investment in technology?</h4><p>Technology is an essential part of our activities, either if it is our own technology or that of our partners. Therefore, to set a figure in terms of investment in technology would be difficult.</p><div class="quote">“People have become more aware of natural gas thanks to its natural conditions and advantages against other hydrocarbons."</div><h4>What are the company's activities in natural gas?</h4><p>In the last 20 years, people have become more aware of natural gas thanks to its natural conditions and advantages against other hydrocarbons. In addition, transportation techniques have improved dramatically and that has played a key role in making natural gas a worldwide commodity. Currently, the US is, thanks to the shale gas infrastructure developed over the years, the world's leading producer of natural gas, and in terms of reserves overcoming even Russia. In terms of Ecuador, it has traditionally focused on oil, leaving aside gas. However, the government has realized the potential of this natural resource and it has already started investing in this area. For example, the government came to us to develop a pilot project to implement a fleet of 100 taxis run by gas. We are just waiting on licenses to start this project. We currently have one service station operating and we believe that thanks to this pilot project we could expand the overall number of taxis to up to 400 and build a new service station. We are also about to sign an agreement with Hyundai to provide it with natural gas for a number of other projects. The government's main aim is to change the energy matrix in public transportation in the main cities of Ecuador in order to reduce pollution. In this regard, I would like to stress the commitment of our company to develop the natural gas industry alongside the government.</p><h4>What role does natural gas play in your overall activities in the country?</h4><p>At the time being, it is very minimal; however, we are sure that the pilot project will definitely boost the industry and increase the importance of natural gas in our portfolio in the country. I believe that public transport and the Ecuadorean industrial network represent a very promising target for the natural gas industry in this country, and hopefully, we will see the usage of natural gas increasing in the near future. Again, we are committed to contribute to the development of the Ecuadorean natural gas industry thanks to our know-how and expertise in the field at the international level.</p><h4>What are the main activities the company is implementing in terms of social responsibility?</h4><p>Over the last few years, we have strengthened our social responsibility activities toward the communities where the company operates. For example, not long ago we put together a book with the history, traditions, culture, and some pictures of the Waorani community. The book is available for sale and all the proceeds from it go directly to the community. Additionally, we also have workers from this community as part of our staff. Synergy Group E&amp;P Ecuador is characterized by consistent respect to stakeholders, ethical behavior, transparency, accountability, the rule of law and respect for the principles of social responsibility embedded in the international standard ISO 26000:2010, on which we are working. Likewise, our support and respect for the universal principles of human rights, labor standards, the environment, and anti-corruption are expressed through the Global Compact initiative, which we are attached to from this year.</p><h4>What are the challenges facing the hydrocarbon industry in Ecuador?</h4><p>Both international players and Ecuador face the same challenges: government and local community relations with oil hydrocarbon companies and human capital. Therefore, I believe that the government's legislation and legal framework should be more favorable, while we try to attract human capital into the industry and continue investing in new technology.</p><h4>What should Ecuador do to capitalize on its potential to become a relevant hydrocarbon player worldwide?</h4><p>The government of Ecuador should establish a better legal framework that attracts foreign players; it should not become a bureaucratic burden for companies coming to Ecuador. In terms of companies, we should make sure we do our work properly so that we gain the trust of both governments and local communities. We should further strengthen our commitment to the environment and the local communities in the country.</p><h4>What are your future business plans?</h4><p>We will take part in the many tendering processes in Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador. At the same time, we will look into expanding partnerships with other companies. Additionally, in Cuba, where we have been working with the government for the last five years, we are considered an A-Class company—the highest level—and we have optimistic future perspectives to start exploitation work in the near future. In Mexico, we are also considering many potential activities. In Ecuador, we aim to become a leading player in managing mature fields within the natural gas industry.</p><h4>What's your general outlook for the Ecuadorean economy for the medium term?</h4><p>This is a very attractive time for the entire Latin American region, as the particular cases of Ecuador, Colombia, or even Peru are proving. Ecuador needs to further attract foreign investment in order to boost growth and development, just as Peru and Colombia have been doing.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the major developments at Azercell in 2012?</h4><p>For Azercell, 2012 was very intensive and full of new horizons. The company's market share of Azerbaijan's mobile communication market is 53%, and its network covers 99.8% of the country's population. By the end of 2012, the number of Azercell subscribers reached 4.4 million people. We operate 54 customer service centers, of which 32 are in the regions. The most exemplary symbols of Azercell's successes in 2012 were the general sponsorship of the Eurovision Song Contest 2012, the deployment of 4G mobile internet technology (LTE) for first time in Azerbaijan, and the significant upgrade of our 3G network. Currently, Azercell is the provider of the fastest mobile internet in Azerbaijan. In 2012, Azercell received a silver certificate issued by the Investors in People (IIP). Azercell Telecom LLC is the first company to receive a silver certificate among the countries of the CIS, and most importantly among other international telecommunications companies. Azercell is a part of the TeliaSonera group of companies, and in 2012 the group became one of the world's top 100 sustainable companies, rated 13th on the list compiled by the World Economic Forum.</p><h4>Having recently been appointed CEO of Azercell, what are some of your personal aims for the company in the short term?</h4><p>In a country where the tradition of communications is part of a person's identity, earning the trust of millions does not come easily. In this endeavor, we had to make a long but interesting journey together with our loyal subscribers. In the age of digitalization, Azercell has been playing an active part in the process of enhancing people's access to information, knowledge, and education, which in turn is helping to transform their lives and foster social change. Our network helps people to do business, as well as save time and money on travel.</p><h4>The mobile penetration rate in Azerbaijan stands at around 115%, which is well over the world average of 80%. What does it take to thrive in this environment?</h4><p>Azerbaijan is a fast-growing country with a young population. In a country with such high mobile penetration, Azercell manages to maintain its position as the leading mobile operator in Azerbaijan. Our superb customer care and quality network ensure that Azercell is the first choice for most Azerbaijanis. Looking back at our history, we realize that Azercell has not merely been a cellphone company, but truly a part of the society where it is functioning.</p><div class="quote">“Currently, Azercell is the provider of the fastest mobile internet in Azerbaijan."</div><h4>It will be President Ilham Aliyev's 10-year anniversary in 2013. How would you describe the economic developments in Azerbaijan over the past decade?</h4><p>Over the last 10 years, Azerbaijan has developed a lot. The government of Azerbaijan has made every effort to make the country attractive to businesses, investors, and tourists. Today, Azerbaijan is one of the world's fastest-growing economies. It has become a venue for global events, conferences, and festivals, through which our culture is promoted and the world gets to know and understand Azerbaijan better.</p><h4>What are Azercell's medium-term plans?</h4><p>Our goal is to be a company that every Azerbaijani can be proud of. Azercell has done its utmost to earn this title by providing the best service to its subscribers, and we will continue to do so even further.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Having recently joined Azerfon, what are your priorities and goals for the next couple of years?<br></h4><p>We have been working on improving our network since 2011, and have just completed a major upgrade. In Baku we have an outstanding network. We are strong in the regions, but still have more work to do. We will continue to focus on improving our network, as this is the core “product" of a telecommunications company. Secondly, we want to continue to provide a range of tariff offerings to our consumers. Each of our tariffs provides excellent value to the consumer, each meets a specific consumer need, and our prices are very competitive. With a stronger network, and the best tariffs, we think we offer great value. Thirdly, we aim to improve our consumer services at touch points, such as customer care, and in our shops. We are constantly working on increasing the quality of our services. Finally, we plan to strengthen our brand during 2013, to better capitalize on our core offering.</p><h4>How will you be repositioning the brand?</h4><p>We need to be more consistent in our visualization and advertising. I worked for five years as Chief Marketing Officer at Beeline in Russia, which is the core brand of VimpelCom. One of the main reasons that we did so well was that we had incredible consistency, and we were very careful in all of our messaging to make sure it contributed to the strength of the brand. We now need to evolve our advertising message in that vein. Azerfon used to run two brands: Nar Mobile and Azerfon-Vodafone. We have now consolidated behind the Nar Mobile brand.</p><h4>Azerbaijan currently has a mobile penetration rate of 115% and a fixed-line rate of under 20%. What is the reason for the gap?</h4><p>When I was at VimpelCom, I had a chance to do business not just in Russia, but also in eight countries in the CIS, where these statistics were not uncommon. The development of fixed-line infrastructure was not a huge priority in the former Soviet states, and so when mobile telephony was introduced, it was an easy way to expand and reach people. Frankly, mobile telephony is much more convenient than fixed, and the infrastructure is much easier to develop, so it is better for the consumer. The 115% rate is based on registered SIM cards and the use of multiple kinds of devices, including tablets and dongles. Baku is well penetrated in terms of consumers that use mobile phones, and the expansion is related to dongles and second devices. Expansion in the regions, however, is primarily concentrated on new mobile users.</p><h4>What is Nar Mobile's position in the market?</h4><p>In terms of subscribers who have used our services within the last 90 days (90-day subs), we grew 25% in 2012. This makes us the fastest-growing mobile operator in Azerbaijan. Our mission is to provide communication space in which people can network, work, and entertain. We strongly believe in making telecommunications affordable and reliable.</p><h4>How would you describe the strengths of the telecoms sector in Azerbaijan overall?</h4><p>Compared to Western Europe, the penetration rate is higher due to the lack of fixed-line infrastructure here. As there is not as much fixed, there is also less broadband and that means that the use of mobile data is higher here than in many other parts of the world. The number of data subscribers in our network has more than doubled over the last year. Azerbaijan is a follower compared to countries with the latest technologies, but we are one of the first companies in the CIS to implement in-air phone calls in cooperation with Swedish company “OnAir." We have an agreement with Azerbaijani Airlines (AZAL) to provide our customers with mobile communication services while flying on its newer aircraft. We have a chance to look at what works in the world and judge what we think will be accepted by our consumers here in Azerbaijan.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of Azerbaijan Railways and what has your role been in its development?</h4><p>The construction and the subsequent development of the first railway in Azerbaijan were associated with the transportation of oil. For many years, oil was primitively transported in barrels, which were placed on carts and carried by caravans. The industrial workers of Baku were interested in building the railway and pipelines to be able to increase their profits from selling oil. Thus, oil producers and the managers of oil refineries had repeatedly asked the Committee of Ministers for the construction of the railway. A meeting of the Committee of Ministers attended by Czar Alexander II on June 16, 1878 approved a project on the construction of a railway for the oil industry. The construction of a 27-kilometer-long railway was entrusted to the “Poti-Tbilisi" railway association. The construction of the railway began in 1878 and was completed in 1879. On December 17, 1879, the Balakhani, Surakhani, and Sabunchu railway stations started receiving goods for railway transportation. The official opening ceremony of the railway was held on January 20, 1880, as oil was transported in tankers for the first time in the world. Since that historic date, Azerbaijan's railways have developed in parallel with the growing demand for cargo transportation. At present, the total length of Azerbaijan's rail network is 2,910.1 kilometers, including the operational length of 2,079.3 kilometers. The latter includes an 802.3-kilometer, two-way section. A section of 1,241.4 kilometers of the operational length, or 59.7%, is electrified, while 837.9 kilometers, or 40.3%, is intended for diesel-powered locomotives. A total of 1,527.7 kilometers are provided with automatic signaling equipment. It is also worth mentioning that the first electric railway in the USSR was commissioned on July 26, 1926, when electric trains started moving between Sabunchu and Surakhani, the well-known oil districts of the Absheron Peninsula. Two out of 176 railway stations of the Azerbaijan Railways, Bilajari and H.Z. Tagiyev, are fully automated distributing stations. A dozen stations have container yards equipped with all the necessary machinery and mechanisms, while three others (Keshla, Ganja, and Khirdalan) carry out operations involving large-tonnage containers. Whereas in the first 10 years since being established the railways were closely associated with the development of oil production and refining, beginning from the latter half of the 20th century the railways started to serve the growing needs of the national economy and were extensively used for the transit of goods to neighboring countries. The relatively recent history of Azerbaijan was a period of difficult ordeals for both the railways and the country as a whole. After the break-up of the Soviet Union in the 1990s, Azerbaijan's railways entered a period of recession, the economic links with neighboring countries were interrupted, cargo and passenger transportation were reduced to the minimal level, and transportation in some directions was completely interrupted. As a result of this, the railway infrastructure became unserviceable, qualified professionals had to seek employment in other areas, and the republic's railways were in disarray. The fact that Azerbaijan was dragged into the conflict around Nagorno-Karabakh further exacerbated the situation. As a result of this aggression, which has led to the occupation of 20% of Azerbaijan's territory by Armenian armed units and the emergence of more than 1 million Azerbaijani refugees, the Azerbaijan's railways sustained serious damage. A section of more than 240 kilometers in length was exposed to Armenian aggression. Due to the suspension of railway traffic in the Mehri-Karchivan direction, the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic was cut off from the rest of the republic and has been bearing the brunt of a blockade for over 20 years. Although the entire railway infrastructure and rolling stock in the said territories have been completely destroyed, the railway managed to survive such a difficult period and succeeded in meeting the demand for transportation. On June 15, 1993, the national leader of the Azerbaijani people Heydar Aliyev returned to power following the persistent demands of the people, and he managed to stem the economic decline. This was a turning point in the development of the railways, and the start of a period of revival for the country's steel trunk. Specific measures were taken in those years to organize railway passenger transportation both in the country and to neighboring republics at a high level. The railway department started a major campaign to renovate passenger carriages using its own resources. Shortly afterward, high-quality passenger carriages meeting international requirements were commissioned. The commissioning of the “Express" passenger carriages with soft seats for the first time in the history of Azerbaijani railways and in the CIS was received very well by the country's population. The economic relations of Azerbaijan Railways with neighboring countries were restored, paving the way for the reopening of passenger and cargo routes to the Russian cities of Moscow, St. Petersburg, Rostov, Tyumen, Makhachkala, the Ukrainian cities Kiev and Kharkov, the Georgian capital Tbilisi, and the city of Tabriz in the Islamic Republic of Iran. The current President of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, has signed a number of decisions to bring the railway transport system into line with international standards. The key objectives of the programs have been to meet the needs of the growing population and economic demand for railway services, to address the government's defense needs, to increase Azerbaijan's transit potential, to improve the quality of railway transport, to reduce the cost of passenger and cargo transportation, to contribute to the effective operation of the transport system in general, and to facilitate the overall socioeconomic development of the country. Since I assumed leadership of the railways in 2003, this sector has experienced drastic reforms and structural changes, the volume of passenger and cargo transportation has significantly increased, and specific measures have been taken to improve the safety of railway transportation. In an effort to execute the State Program, Azerbaijan Railways has purchased maintenance machines and equipment, set up new production lines, and introduced state-of-the-art technology.</p><h4>How has the construction of the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars (BTK) railway cemented Azerbaijan's position as a regional railway hub?</h4><p>The BTK railway project will provide a transport link from the Caspian and Central Asian regions to Europe, facilitate passenger and cargo access from Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey to European countries, and eventually speed up the process of Azerbaijan's integration into Europe. In addition to deriving economic dividends from the increased railway traffic, Azerbaijan will become a transit hub and significantly strengthen its regional standing. Azerbaijan's participation in any project that can bring stability, prosperity, and economic benefit to the region, including the BTK railway line, is highly important because it will be possible to use this transport artery to send and receive goods on an area stretching from China to Europe. As President of the Republic of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev said at the signing ceremony of the agreement on the construction of the BTK railway in Tbilisi on February 7, 2007, “the implementation of this project will bring us even closer together, step up regional cooperation, bring stability and prosperity to the region, and serve the interests of our countries and peoples."</p><h4>Does Azerbaijan Railways focus more on passenger transport or cargo transport?</h4><p>Since most of the budget of Azerbaijan Railways is formed on account of cargo transport, the company focuses more on this aspect. However, Azerbaijan Railways is doing everything it can to meet the demand for passenger railway transport.</p><h4>What percentage of the population travels by rail as opposed to other modes of transport?</h4><p>In 2012, the railway service was used by a total of 2.7 million, or about 30% of the population.</p><h4>How many passengers did Azerbaijan Railways carry in 2012?</h4><p>A total of 2.61 million passengers traveled from railway stations in 2012. Passenger transportation constituted 2.7 million people, including 305,700 on international routes.</p><h4>What are the medium-term plans for Azerbaijan Railways?</h4><p>In the next five to six years, Azerbaijan Railways plans to completely upgrade its infrastructure, renew the existing equipment, switch the Baku-Boyuk Kasik direction to 27.5 kV AC and subsequently to the micro-processor signaling system, create an automated signaling system for cargo and passenger transport, purchase new passenger carriages, wagons and one- and two-system locomotives operating on AC, increase the traveling speed of trains to 140 kilometers per hour, meet the growing population and economic demand for railway transport services, address the government's defense needs, increase Azerbaijan's transit potential, reduce the cost of passenger and cargo transportation, ensure the effective and viable operation of railways, facilitate our contribution to the socioeconomic development of the country, and secure a place among the railway administrations of the world's developed countries.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of Yeni Hayat in Azerbaijan and what has your involvement in the company been?</h4><p>Yeni Hayat was founded in 2002. I believe we have managed to set up one of the leading companies in the construction sector by establishing high-quality standards. Back in 2002, we were only building residential houses. Now we are a part of a large group of companies and develop more sophisticated and unique architectural projects. Yeni Hayat has always collaborated with leading European companies, and thus obtained extensive experience with advanced technology that has been implemented in our projects. Yeni Hayat was named as such because construction is not only a business for us; it is also a new life and mindset. Every building we have constructed has left an imprint on our city because of its architectural concept and remains a heritage for future generations.</p><h4>What are some of the most notable achievements of Yeni Hayat?</h4><p>Yeni Hayat is trying to carry out both architecturally and functionally more interesting activities. There is a global public reaction to our magnificent and unique buildings, hospitals, schools, Olympic and sports facilities, and concert halls. We try to ensure that every facility we build becomes an identity of quality and beauty. Overall, 2012 was extremely successful for us. Our latest project, and source of great honor for us, is Azure, a 141,000-sqm facility that includes residential buildings, business and trade centers, and the largest indoor family entertainment center in Europe. Another great accomplishment is Megafun, which is also an entertainment center.</p><h4>What are your plans for 2013 moving forward?</h4><p>Several opportunities exist for large-scale projects today. We will seize any available opportunities and work on the creation of similar family entertainment centers in various regions across Azerbaijan in 2013. In the near future, Megafun will expand into Russia, Turkey, Georgia, and Kazakhstan. We are reviewing all cooperation proposals.</p><div class="quote">“The ongoing development of the construction sector has had a positive effect on the sectors that provide raw materials."</div><h4>How did the idea of supporting the Azerbaijan Olympic team come about?</h4><p>Sports have become a visiting card of Azerbaijan, something that promotes the country abroad. We are very happy that sports are highly developed in the country. Culture and sports cannot develop without strong public support. I think our people are happy because the country is led by someone who goes beyond just helping and supporting sports and athletes. The President has devoted a lot of care to this area. I have been working in close contact with athletes for many years, and I say with confidence that the achievements of athletes are not valued as highly anywhere else in the world as they are here in Azerbaijan. We view our esteemed President as an example in both our business activities and in all other spheres of life. Therefore, we are trying to provide any help we can to the athletes, whose mission is to promote our country around the world.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the importance of the construction sector in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>The ongoing development of the construction sector has had a positive effect on the sectors that provide raw materials and contributed to the production and trade of various long-term consumables. Since the beginning of the 20th century, there have been large-scale developments within the construction sector, and dozens of residential buildings and facilities that were built and commissioned over the years are now protected and preserved in order to retain their architectural heritage. In more recent years, hundreds of high-rise apartment buildings meeting international and EU standards were built and commissioned.</p><h4>How has the economic development of the country progressed over the past decade?</h4><p>The socioeconomic reforms under the leadership of President Ilham Aliyev have fostered the country's development. Economic strategies pursued by the leadership of the country provide sustainable economic growth and simultaneously improve the welfare of the Azerbaijani people. Socioeconomic indicators over the last decade show that our country managed to remain unaffected and provide opportunities for long-term development. Azerbaijan has taken confident and successful steps toward the further liberalization of the economic system and a strong diversification policy, as well as the effective use of the abundant natural resources and regional capacity.</p><h4>What are the medium-term plans for your company?</h4><p>Our primary mission is to strengthen our influence in the construction sector of the Caucasus and Eurasian regions by participating in important regional projects. Our goal is to become an internationally competitive company working beyond the borders of Azerbaijan.</p><h4>Yeni Hayat has been active in its support for Azerbaijan's athletes. How did the idea of supporting the Olympic team come about?</h4><p>Sport has become some kind of a visiting card for Azerbaijan, something that promotes the country abroad. We, the people of Azerbaijan, are very happy that sport is highly developed in this country. However, it is also true that culture and sport cannot develop without strong public support. From this point of view, I think our people are twice as happy because the country is led by someone who goes beyond just helping and supporting sports and athletes. The President has surrounded this area with truly parental care. I have been working in close contact with sportsmen and women for many years. And I say with confidence that their achievements are not valued as highly anywhere else in the world. Nowhere else is there such care and attention to sport and sportsmen and women. We view our esteemed President as an example in both our business activities and in all other spheres of life. Therefore, we are trying to provide any help we can to our sportsmen and women, whose noble mission is to promote our country abroad.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the rapid influx of international companies and expatriates influenced the real estate market?<br></h4><p>This is a positive thing for both the Azerbaijani community and those who are lucky enough to work in Azerbaijan. The demand and success of business in Baku and elsewhere has created a market where developers and agencies, such as Qaya Emlak, can operate in the high-end property market, which is beneficial for both residents and landlords.</p><h4>What trends can you identify in the local real estate market?</h4><p>After the construction boom, deluxe and A-class properties became the main sector of both residential and commercial construction. Those properties are being prepared to serve both the local and expatriate community. Customers today are willing to pay, but they are looking for superior service. Today's market requires professional real estate in the general, commercial, and residential spheres with high standards of property management. Qaya Emlak is investigating the current situation to integrate a property management system through the major developers it is working with.</p><h4>Which sectors of the real estate market have seen the most growth?</h4><p>Baku is a city that is evolving quickly; however, in a sensible and strategic way. I expect that we will see an increase across all sectors of real estate over the coming years in residential, office, and hotels. Offices are of particular interest to us as there is room for some iconic headquarter buildings on Baku's skyline. I know these are under construction, and I am looking forward to seeing them succeed. Qaya Emlak as a business operates in all these areas of real estate, and it will seek to add value to both buyers and sellers.</p><div class="quote">“Today's market requires professional real estate in the general, commercial, and residential spheres."</div><h4>Who is your target market and what is your rental/purchase breakdown?</h4><p>Qaya Emlak was set up a few years ago to provide professional real estate services to local and international communities within Azerbaijan. Our target market is all social groups, but we mainly plan to set up long-term business relations with major developers. Qaya Emlak as a company will evolve according to the demands of our customers. If we see an increase in the requirements for rental properties among both the international and local communities, then we will inform our landlord contacts and attempt to make mutually beneficial deals. As of now, our main business is the sale of residential units.</p><h4>What initiatives is Qaya Emlak taking to allow increased access to housing?</h4><p>In order to allow increased access to housing, Qaya Emlak offers long-term credit options for its customers from the exclusive portfolios of various developers. As a team whose main target is customer satisfaction, we also consider various payment options for our lower-income customers.</p><h4>How is Qaya Emlak capitalizing on the burgeoning tourism sector?</h4><p>Qaya Emlak is a business specifically set up to work with both international and local people. The tourism boom will continue to increase greatly over the next few years, allowing us to advise landlords how to enhance their properties to take advantage of this. For example, having shops that tourists wish to visit on the lower floors of their buildings can be an excellent source of income—often far more lucrative than selling the space as apartments.</p><h4>What is the outlook for Azerbaijani real estate in the medium term?</h4><p>Azerbaijan is expecting improvements in social loans and an increase in the mortgage budget. Investments and new projects are being implemented, which will increase our portfolio and create new areas in Baku city. Also, an increase in the number of mortgages will help young working- class people gain access to housing.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of your major achievements over the past year?</h4><p>The project of the highway leading to Baku Flag Square was completed in May 2012. We also completed the construction of a new international airport in Gabala, with a runway length of 3,600 meters. This will be very important for the region, which is rich with summer and winter tourism resources. We have also built a highway from the airport to Gabala. We hope to draw many tourists from different countries in the future. In addition to this, we have built a new runway at a length of 4,000 meters and reconstructed the existing one at Heydar Aliyev International Airport. Besides these huge civil construction projects, several new road projects around Baku were implemented by AzVirt.</p><h4>Do you have any plans for further international expansion?</h4><p>We generally concentrate our activity on Eastern Europe and the Balkans. We started a highway construction project in Serbia, and we have also been awarded a design-and-build project in Romania, and construction work is planned to start in the near future.</p><h4>What new projects do you have in the pipeline in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>The first section of the road from Bilgah to Sumgait (a 14-kilometer stretch), including one tunnel, one bridge, and one underground pedestrian passage, is completed. The second section of the project (from kilometer 14 to kilometer 42) is expected to be finished in 2015, and will consist of six traffic lanes and 12 bridges. The main reason for the construction of this motorway is to join the northeastern part of the Absheron peninsula with the Baku-Guba highway leading to the north via the Mardakan-Bilgah-Novkhany-Sumgait motorway, without entering Baku city. Other projects are the Buzovna-Mardakan-Gala and Gala-Pirallahi routes, at which construction has been ongoing since late 2012. All of our projects focus on the public sector and civil construction. We are also in the process of building a new terminal, a control tower, aprons, and taxiways at Heydar Aliyev International Airport. We expect our work at the airport to be completed in 2013. This will boost capacity to 3 million passengers per year.</p><div class="quote">“Since 2007, five Azerbaijani construction companies have started working in the international arena."</div><h4>Who does AzVirt work with in terms of design?</h4><p>We work on the design of roads without any support. For the airport, the concept design was carried out by ARUP and a UK company. We also subcontract work to smaller companies. In our foreign projects we find local designers to partner with.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the Azerbaijani construction sector?</h4><p>Since 2007, five Azerbaijani construction companies have started working in the international arena. This shows the progress of the construction market in Azerbaijan, as well as demonstrates the high quality and innovation of our production. This expansion is poised to continue, and we are satisfied with the construction market in the country.</p><h4>In the past decade, how would you quantify the changes in Azerbaijan's investment landscape?</h4><p>The changes are visible for everyone. The past 10 years have been marked as a period of immense change for Azerbaijan, mostly because of our great leader, President Ilham Aliyev. The government is actively working to increase the amount of non-oil FDI. This leads to more business opportunities in the construction field.</p><h4>What are AzVirt's medium-term plans?</h4><p>We would like to become one of the largest and best Azerbaijani companies in the international arena. We are becoming more popular day by day due to our major projects here in Azerbaijan.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Matanat A is a leading company in Azerbaijan and the region. As President of the company, how would you evaluate its activities?<br></h4><p>Matanat A was launched as a company in 2000. Its key development principle has been to bring the latest technology and the most advanced construction techniques to Azerbaijan and pave the way for innovation. We have achieved our goal over the years, as the company's portfolio currently includes over 1,000 products and more than 200 trademarks. The company has tried to operate in accordance with the requirements of a free market economy. Both ordinary consumers and companies implementing major construction projects in Azerbaijan have great confidence in the products of Matanat A. This confidence is certainly a product of our hard and goal-oriented work. Matanat A is the author of several patents. We can point to our company's FasNatural product, which replaces aglay stone and has already been patented in over 150 countries around the world. FasNatural is a dry mixture used on building façades. In comparison with aglay stone, it does not absorb moisture, will not crack in shafts, and reduces the façade burden by 11 times. This suggests that our company not only applies the technology available in the world, but also works to design its own techniques and innovations, thus contributing to the development of the global construction industry.<br></p><h4>The construction sector is booming in Azerbaijan. What portion of your business is local, what portion is international, and where do you see the most growth potential?</h4><p>In fact, not only the construction sector but also other sectors of the economy are experiencing dynamic development as a result of the government's successful economic policies. The overall economic development has had a knock-on effect on the construction segment as well. Matanat A has also benefited from the boom in the construction sector by producing high-quality and modern building materials. Most of the company's business is in Azerbaijan; however, we also work with other countries. Our international activity currently consists of exports. The products of Matanat A are exported to CIS countries, including Russia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan. Since products in this segment of the construction industry cost very little, are in large supply, and are quite heavy in weight, it is not deemed economically viable to transport them over long distances. Therefore, production has to be organized in regional countries. Regarding the potential for growth, it is clear that globalization is the driving force behind economic growth. Our company sees the main source of growth both in the future development of the domestic construction sector and in expanding its business on a global scale.</p><h4>It was reported that Matanat A would build a facility that will produce construction materials in the Krasnodar region of Russia. How does this move fit into your current growth strategy?</h4><p>We consider exports to foreign countries a top priority for our activities and make every effort to increase them. Since it is not economically profitable to transport our products over long distances, the organization of production in some foreign countries becomes inevitable. Russia's Krasnodar region is one of the places where Matanat A plans on building a plant. Its construction will take place using Russian credit resources. This regional enlargement is fully in line with the company's growth strategy and we are confident that the national brand of Matanat A will also earn recognition outside Azerbaijan.</p><h4>What are the benefits and challenges of expanding your regional footprint?</h4><p>Globalization opens up both extensive opportunities and challenges for businesses. Obviously, successful operations in foreign markets are important for sustainable development. One of the key challenges of working in a foreign market is the fact that entry into a different business and competition environment requires different, diverse skills, additional resources, and successful strategies. Despite the said challenges, several competitive companies have emerged in Azerbaijan in recent years. Matanat A considers its operations in foreign markets to be highly competitive.</p><h4>How would you rate Azerbaijan as a base for multi-national operations?</h4><p>Azerbaijan is one of the most favorable places for multinational operations. The investment and business environment in the country has received positive assessments from the world's leading rating agencies such as Standard and Poor's, Moody's, and Fitch. Also, Azerbaijan is ranked highly in the World Bank's Doing Business and Global Competitiveness reports, which can be viewed as international confirmation of the attractive business and investment climate in the  country.</p><h4>Over the past decade, what have been the most important changes in Azerbaijan's business landscape and economy?</h4><p>In the 10 years of Ilham Aliyev's presidency, the Azerbaijani economy has undergone dramatic and fundamental changes. The fact that the GDP has tripled in the past eight years is the best indicator of economic and social growth. All spheres of economic and social life have experienced dramatic changes for the better. The non-oil sector has developed at a rapid pace in the last 10 years, a competitive army of national businesses has emerged, and a strong infrastructure network highly important to entrepreneurs has been put in place. In general, our country has made great strides in terms of regional socioeconomic development in district areas. The improving standard of living in the country has given an impetus to all sectors of the economy. Azerbaijan has joined the ranks of the world's sustainable economies and is a major economic player in the region.</p><h4>Where does “Matanat A" see itself in the medium term?</h4><p>In the medium term “Matanat A" will continue its course for the development and application of new construction technologies. To support ongoing government programs, the creation of jobs will be one of our priorities. To this end, we plan on building and commissioning new plants. The new plants to be built in Azerbaijan, in particular the limestone plant to be established in Gazakh District, will enhance our production base. The company also intends to establish a network of branches in foreign countries in order to increase exports and accelerate our integration into foreign markets.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[island-paradise]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the latest developments with the Khazar Islands project?</h4><p>We have begun constructing the buildings on the islands, and 13 are already nearing completion. In addition to this, we reclaimed 300 hectares of land. A 276-meter bridge is slated for completion in February 2013. We have created 10 hectares of green spaces, and a five-hectare space will boast three football stadiums and a number of tennis courts, while the other section is designed to become what we call “Children's World." In June 2013, the parks will be finished and nine restaurants will be opened. We have already finished the microbrewery, where residents and visitors can watch how their refreshments are prepared.</p><h4>What preparations were made for the completion of Phase I, and what can we expect from this initial work?</h4><p>We bring the stones from the mountain, which is 10 kilometers from the sea, to reclaim land to build Khazar Islands. We expect to finish filling Phase I in 2015. There will be 6 million sqm of construction works during Phase I, including 20 kilometers of boulevards in total. Phase I will be made up of six islands, and the development of four of them is in progress. Filling the land is a difficult task, so we will use specialized Dutch ships for this type of work. There will also be four hotels and apartment complexes. When Phase I is complete, it will also feature 40 restaurants on the water.</p><h4>How is the project being financed?</h4><p>We have planned to finish the construction in 2016-2017. In total, we will need to invest $10 billion to complete Phase I. Of this amount, 20% will be sourced from Avesta concern, 20% from remaining funds, and 60% will come from sales. There is a new mortgage law being developed in Azerbaijan, and if it passes into legislation we will also be able to extend mortgages on apartments in the complex while the facilities are still under construction. Therefore, even if the execution of sales hasn't finished yet, the mortgages will begin in March 2013.</p><div class="quote">“I expect Azerbaijan to earn at least $20 billion a year from tourism revenues."</div><h4>What other projects is Avesta Concern involved in?</h4><p>Avesta comprises 25 companies, each of which is involved in a different sector, whether it be tourism, construction, marketing, or advertising, for example. We have several other projects in addition to the Khazar Islands project. Another initiative is a trade center that we expect to complete by end-2014. We also have five large apartment projects, all of which are under construction now, as well as a hospital. I also want to create several manufacturing zones in order to use local production more widely to meet our needs.</p><h4>How would you describe the investment climate in the local construction sector?</h4><p>This used to be an area of great concern for the country. However, with new laws the construction sector has become relatively well regulated. Today, I believe that Azerbaijan still needs approximately 100 million sqm of new construction projects, and for this to come to fruition, foreign investment is essential.</p><h4>How would you assess the evolution of the construction sector over past decade?</h4><p>A decade ago the construction sector was in disarray; the contracts were concluded and the companies constructed without licenses, and as a result the quality was very poor. Now, everything is well regulated, firms have the appropriate licenses, and certain quality standards have been firmly followed.</p><h4>What are Avesta's medium-term plans?</h4><p>We are planning to build 19 large bridges during Phase I, which will not use asphalt on the roads. Even though it is very expensive, the company prefers granite, which lasts thousands of years. In the long term, granite could be up to 50 times cheaper than asphalt, which has to be reapplied every few years. Another facility will have the capacity to serve 1 million people and boast two stories of underground car parking, with a capacity for 1 million cars. We are planning to set several world records: the largest car park, the longest boulevard (at 150 kilometers), the most restaurants in one city, a 1,050-meter tall building, and 150 bridges. We expect 700 million people to visit Azerbaijan solely to see this building. The company also expects at least 20 million people a year to visit Azerbaijan in general. To accommodate these rising visitor numbers, Azerbaijan needs to expand its transportation infrastructure. I expect Azerbaijan to earn at least $20 billion a year from tourism revenues. This would mean more revenue from tourism than from the oil and gas sector. Azerbaijan Tower will promote the name of Azerbaijan everywhere, and thus I am putting all of my effort into this project because as an Azerbaijani man I love my motherland. The President and his administration have also been of great support to us, and we would like to reciprocate this great support with a project worthy of this country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Improved Outcomes]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[improved-outcomes]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the major developments within the Ministry over the past few years?</h4><p>There has been huge growth in almost all sectors of agriculture over the past decade. Our GDP was AZN1.45 billion in 2003, and reached AZN4.76 billion in 2012. The volume of agricultural produce increased by 330%; this figure encompasses all agricultural products. The main reasons for this growth are the numerous decrees for the development of the agrarian sector signed by President Ilham Aliyev. This growth is not exhaustive, and there is the potential for more in our country. The implementation of state programs signed by the President, including the one on the socioeconomic development of the regions, will enable the sustained growth of the agricultural sector in the future as well.</p><h4>How would you assess the importance of agriculture for the diversification of Azerbaijan's economy?</h4><p>Azerbaijan is known to the world as a country rich in oil and gas resources. Indeed, the driving force of the economy rests on oil and gas. However, during the first years of independence the oil and gas industry was a major part of the national economy, and now the development of the non-oil sector is a national priority. Therefore, the President committed the government to doubling GDP during the period of 2010-2020, and this growth should come from the non-oil sector. The agricultural sector constitutes part of the non-oil sector, and I think the potential for growth still exists. The volume of agricultural produce in 2020 will be twice as much as in 2010. We pay great attention to the diversification of the national economy. We do not want our economy to be dependent on oil and gas alone. The President has declared his wish to turn oil capital into human capital. The agricultural sector is developing in line with other non-oil sectors of the economy, thus contributing to diversification.</p><h4>What are the major improvements that have occurred in Azerbaijan's productivity from an agricultural perspective?</h4><p>As part of the increased financial support given to the agricultural sector, Agroleasing OJSC was established. Every year, agricultural machinery, technological equipment, and mineral fertilizers are purchased and imported into Azerbaijan by Agroleasing through funds allocated from the state budget and accumulations from Agroleasing's own operations. These are then provided to farmers and rural entrepreneurs on a concessional basis, and consequently these new technologies and equipment contribute to increased productivity in agriculture. Improved productivity is one of the challenges in the agricultural sector, because land is limited in Azerbaijan. In order to develop livestock production, highly productive breeding cattle are imported from Europe and bred here through artificial insemination. All this ultimately contributes to increased livestock productivity. For the crop production sector, we use high-yielding seeds. All of these activities will enable us to sustain intensive growth in agriculture.</p><div class="quote">“A large variety of products—particularly fruits, vegetables, garden crops, and their processed parts—are exported from Azerbaijan."</div><h4>To what extent does the Ministry provide subsidies for agricultural activities?</h4><p>Subsidies are provided in several different ways. For example, agricultural producers are exempt from most taxes; they only pay land tax, which is marginal. Apart from this, the President signed a decree in January 2007 regarding state support to agricultural producers. According to this decree, AZN40 per hectare of arable land is provided to all farmers for fuel and lubricants. In addition, AZN40 per hectare of land is provided to rice and wheat producers. Furthermore, the government subsidizes 50% of all mineral fertilizers used, and 50% of the cost of the imported highly productive cattle is covered by the government, with the remainder paid by the farmer over three years. We also provide subsidies in the seed-growing sector. In total, AZN573 million worth of subsidies were given to agricultural producers in 2012.</p><h4>What role does FDI play within the agricultural sector of Azerbaijan?</h4><p>International organizations have invested and carried out numerous projects in Azerbaijan's agricultural sector. There is a state credit agency within our Ministry, which is responsible for the implementation of projects co-financed by the government of the Republic of Azerbaijan and the World Bank. The latter invites other partners to join a project and invest in Azerbaijan. In addition, the International Fund on Agricultural Development (IFAD) is overseeing projects in Azerbaijan. Overall, 10 projects have been initiated during the period from 2003 to 2012, which has contributed to the agricultural development of the country.</p><h4>What are the medium-term plans for the Ministry?</h4><p>Our medium-term plan is to fully provide our population with food and agricultural products. Today, we import some agricultural products, and at the same time a large variety of products—particularly fruits, vegetables, garden crops, and their processed parts—are exported from Azerbaijan. The main focus of these medium-term plans is to ensure self-sufficiency in all food and agricultural products in Azerbaijan.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[From the Bottom Up]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[from-the-bottom-up]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of Karat Holding in Azerbaijan?<br></h4><p>Karat Holding was established in 1994, and it was a year afterward that the Azerbaijani economy started to make its initial steps to recovery. We started as a family business, and we began by trading agricultural commodities such as wheat, grain, barley, corn, and flour. Then, a few years later, we saw an opportunity to process these commodities in our own country, and we changed from importing to processing. We established our own grain-grinding facility, and we started to produce wheat flour. I started working in the company as an engineer in the mills, and then I moved toward sales and marketing, and finally into the office. Now, I am the head of the company. I think that the head of a company must always start from the bottom. It is important to know all the layers of the company.</p><h4>Do you think the agro-business sector will ever overtake the energy sector in terms of importance and FDI?</h4><p>It is a well-known fact that agro-business has been important for the past 15-20 years. This is because the population of the world is growing, but crop levels are staying the same. Also, if we add climate change and natural disasters into the equation, there is a severe imbalance in the general world crop ratio. This means that all countries defend their own agricultural sustainability with strict policies. It is imperative to keep rising prices stable. Due to climate change, the amount of crops is declining, meaning that agro-business has become a more important issue not only in Azerbaijan, but throughout the world. The energy sector is important, but I think that agro-business is also gaining more prominence because countries must satisfy and fulfill their agricultural needs—people need to eat. These are issues that affect every country, not just Azerbaijan.</p><h4>How would you characterize the FMCG sector?</h4><p>For a producer to reach the level of producing pasta, he must first start at the bottom, which is agricultural commodity trading, then wheat grinding to find further markets for the flour and wheat products. The producer needs to find more by-products, such as biscuits or pasta. We carried out a feasibility study to enter the pasta and spaghetti sector. The tradition of pasta is new in Azerbaijani culture, as it is a foreign way of eating. Starting around our independence, we noticed a growing consumption of pasta, and the per capita consumption rate has increased by over 80%. It is a new product; people who used to eat bread and cheese now prefer to eat pasta with various sauces. I think that it is a part of globalization and people diversifying their eating habits.</p><h4>Even in Azerbaijan, where there is a tradition of rice, are people still moving more toward pasta?</h4><p>It is the habit of the people and you cannot direct them; it doesn't depend on us. If we had made a survey 25 years ago and asked about pasta, people wouldn't know what it was. However, now people know. They even know the different shapes. Even if there is a stable rice tradition, pasta will still continue to gain ground in the market. I think we have made the correct decision. We market our pasta not only in Azerbaijan, but in foreign countries as well. We started to feel the need to export to different countries such as Georgia, Turkmenistan, and further afield to some African and Asian countries. We have lowered our costs during production, and we have found a good marketing policy. I think that it is a new market for us and, since 2010 we have been looking for new opportunities. The “Made in Azerbaijan" label is starting to become more popular in West African countries, the Philippines, Georgia, and in some Central Asian countries.</p><h4>How popular is your animal feed production?</h4><p>Animal feed is a byproduct of our grinding process. Around 25% of the grain that is ground can be used as animal feed, which we call bran. I think it is the second or third most demanded product from us. Bran is not so much a movable product, and we prefer to protect our own farmers by selling the bran here. It is very good for the poultry and meat industries. The more we sell here, the lower the cost of beef and chicken becomes.</p><h4>What are your views on the current economic climate in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>We think that there has been a serious step forward over the last 10 years since our current President has been in power. We have observed a step-by-step increase in the economic climate, and we consider Azerbaijan's role not only as an energy producer, but also as an economic power in the region. Azerbaijan has become a hub for nearby countries, and many economic projects have been started throughout Azerbaijan. This is due to our President's professionalism and his endeavors. Azerbaijan is recognized by NGOs and auditors as a leader in the region, and we have partners that conduct business in many countries. We have a lot of suppliers for instance, from Switzerland to Uzbekistan. The agricultural sector is a very diverse world, and we have many partners who come to visit us. Azerbaijan is unrecognizable from year to year, and this is because of its economic strengths. Over the past decade, it not only displayed an internal growth of business, but also local companies have grown so much that we have started to open up to foreign markets. For example, Karat Holding has grown over the last 10 years, and it has opened up to the nearby countries of Georgia and Russia. This means that Azerbaijan-based capital has started to enter nearby countries, which hasn't been observed for many years. We also own milling facilities in Georgia and 30% of Georgia's flour is produced by Azerbaijan. The Azerbaijani economy has grown so much that we have not only managed to stop the imports of basic foods, but we are now producing and exporting them as well.</p><h4>What are the medium-term plans for your company?</h4><p>We are always thinking of motion, which means we always want to grow our business. We are concentrated on our own business and sector; we don't want to invade other sectors because it is very difficult for us to diversify and it could have severe results. We want to grow in our own field and expand. For example, in 2013, we are willing to add one more brand to our portfolio and expand to one more market, maybe Ukraine. Since 2007, we have modernized all of our mills in Azerbaijan to the same standards as mills in Germany or Switzerland, which have much higher standards than Russia or Turkey. Our plans are to bring our facilities in Georgia up to European standards in the medium term.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been your Ministry's most remarkable achievements in 2012?</h4><p>As a result of the influence of economic opportunities on the life of our citizens, we have achieved sustainable economic growth supported by rising social wellbeing. As a governmental institution, our Ministry works with a strong focus on new achievements in the field of strengthened social policy according to the common development of the country. Our main achievements in 2012 were the improvement of an equal social security system for everyone, the establishment of a reliable mechanism for the protection of the rights of workers, the strengthening of the social protection of low-income citizens and their involvement in active measures for creating self-sufficient opportunities, and the transformation of our system to a more accessible scheme for each citizen based on international experience. One of the main aims of the policies implemented in Azerbaijan is to reduce poverty and, as a result of these policies, we have reduced the poverty level in the country by five times, or approximately 7%, over the last eight years. In 2011, we started “self-support" programs, which provide active support to poor families with certain potential to increase their income by setting up households. After one year, positive results were observed that guaranteed its continuation into 2012, and currently more than 281 families in 15 districts have been involved in this program. Moreover, we are working toward establishing a social support fund that can provide opportunities to gradually move people above the poverty line. The Public Council, established in 2011, was an important step in our cooperation with civil society groups. The Council is actively involved in all fields of activity, including the improvement of social legislation and the implementation of social programs. It is very important to be aware and to take into consideration the opinions of society in each activity, as well as to ensure the participation of the community and transparency in social protection measures. In early 2012, we established the National Tripartite Social Council on Health and Safety at Work with active support from the International Labor Organization (ILO) and other social partners. This Social Council is focused on strengthening joint efforts for the effective protection of workers' rights and increasing efficiency in the context of cooperation with major international organizations. Meanwhile, throughout the year we regularly meet with groups of citizens who benefit from our services, consider their opinions and views, and examine any cases of discontent during the provision of services, as well as their existing potential in order to identify any kind of active support. These factors are important for carrying out more task-oriented activities. On the other hand, in 2012, we have significantly expanded the processing of relevant services for citizens without direct contact with officials. In 2012, we succeeded in the areas of rehabilitation facilities, restoration, treatment services for martyrs' families, and employment, in particular among the youth, as well as cooperation with international organizations and countries.</p><h4>What efforts has the Ministry made to improve the wellbeing of people with disabilities?</h4><p>Azerbaijan has a flexible and purposeful policy related to the material and spiritual needs of people with disabilities. The legislation is regularly being improved based on global experience, international conventions, and the recommendations of public unions. People with disabilities, including children, have all social, economic, political, and individual rights and freedoms enshrined in the Declaration on the Rights of Disabled Persons adopted by the UN General Assembly and in Azerbaijan's legislation. Financial support to these people is being strengthened constantly. For instance, they are being provided with benefits, housing, cars, treatment services, and rehabilitation facilities. As an example, I can note that approximately 5,000 people with disabilities were provided with new apartments and more than 3,200 people with disabilities were provided with cars. The network of rehabilitation and treatment centers for people with disabilities has been significantly extended in the regions. According to state programs approved every year, consecutive measures such as the treatment and rehabilitation of people with disabilities and the meaningful organization of leisure activities, as well as the expansion of the Paralympic team, are being taken. In 2012, the following successes can be noted: recreation facilities for 1,000 people with disabilities were created; over 8,000 people with disabilities were rehabilitated in centers under the Ministry and services for 90 people were provided in Ukraine and Bulgaria; 100 people with bone and muscle diseases were treated at the Naftalan Treatment Center; and Azerbaijani Paralympians won 12 medals including four gold medals in six sports at the London 2012 Summer Paralympic Games. Nowadays, one of the main issues for us is providing the means of recovery for people with limited working abilities. Therefore, we are trying to take social rehabilitation measures regarding medical institutions. I would emphasize that projects implemented in the country with the continued support of the Heydar Aliyev Foundation play an important role in the integration of people with disabilities into society. I should also point out that service trends provide conditions for social integration, and the cooperation of specialized NGOs in this field is especially important. We have provided specialized community-based rehabilitation services on a regular basis to children between three and 12 with mental disabilities from over 120 families at their homes jointly through the Social Services Initiative organization. We can create the necessary skills and habits to eliminate mental and physical problems in these children. These successful projects created the conditions in partnership with specialized civil society unions to continue community-based rehabilitation services. Starting from 2012, NGOs were involved in work based on government orders. In general, together with care and support for people with physical disorders, we consider it important for them to join and be an active part of society and we are taking the relevant steps in this regard.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the employment level in 2013?</h4><p>Azerbaijan is a country that has made great strides in reducing unemployment as a result of the implementation of socioeconomic development programs in the country. More than 1 million jobs were created in the last eight years, and the majority of them were permanent; this process continues successfully. As a result, the unemployment rate is around 5%.</p><h4>Does labor legislation need any changes in order to simplify procedures for the recruitment of foreign specialists in the country?</h4><p>Azerbaijan has become an attractive country for foreign specialists because it provides diversified and harmonious economic development, enhances the applications of advanced technologies, and is an important partner of global and regional economic projects. Certainly, the basis of our immigration policy is the right to choose available vacancies in the first place. On the other hand, the flow of cheap labor from abroad will not provide anything to the continued modernization process in our country. Therefore, our main goal is to create favorable conditions for foreign specialists who meet international standards and will be useful for the development of the national economy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate the success of the FIFA U-17 cup held in Azerbaijan in October 2012, and how does this pave the way for future international sporting events?</h4><p>The FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup 2012 was the first tournament of its kind in Europe and in the Muslim world. We did our best to organize it at the highest level, and I believe we succeeded. There is no doubt that such large events have a huge impact for the future development of the sporting infrastructure in general because of the legacy that they leave behind. There are a number of stadiums that have been part of the legacy of the World Cup, such as the Bakcell Arena, Dalgha Arena, and Bayil Stadium. There are already some other international football events that take place in Azerbaijan, such as the Caspian Cup, which is for U-17 national football teams. There were eight participating national teams in the Caspian Cup 2011 and Caspian Cup 2012. In 2013, there will be 12 teams, and we already have confirmation from large footballing countries such as Turkey, Japan, and the US. Additionally, according to a decision of UEFA's Executive Committee, Azerbaijan will host the U-17 UEFA European Championship Final Tournament in 2016. Hosting such international tournaments has a positive influence on our country, and provides a precedence to organizing other major international sporting events Azerbaijan.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the success of your grassroots football program held in cities around Azerbaijan?</h4><p>There are many different grassroots events organized by AFFA, not only in Baku and Lankaran, but all over the country. Such events assist us greatly in identifying young talent, generating mass participation, and popularizing the game among the younger generations. Grassroots events are an excellent foundation to achieve success in football, and such events will benefit the game. We organize several events in order to promote women's football in the country, such as the Live Your Goals event, which we held jointly with FIFA. Other events, such as the Ball Festival and Grassroots Festival, are regularly conducted throughout Azerbaijan.</p><h4>Do you expect Azerbaijan to be able to participate in the 2014 World Cup?</h4><p>Our national team has already played four official matches in the current 2014 World Cup qualification round. We drew against Israel and Northern Ireland, and lost to group leaders Portugal and Russia. It is not easy to qualify for the World Cup Finals, but we have four home matches coming up, and we expect good results.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the current economic climate in the country, and what effect does this have on the growth of sports?</h4><p>Azerbaijan is now hosting numerous European and international events and tournaments as a result of the continuous support from President Ilham Aliyev. Many Olympic centers have been built in different regions, and now members of the public are starting to use them. At the same time, several more centers are being built. Since 2011, we have seen remarkable progress in terms of the completion of several new stadiums such as Dalga Arena, Bayil Stadium, Bakcell Arena, Agsu Stadium, and Bina Stadium. We have also completely renovated the Tofig Bahramov Stadium, and commenced construction of the Olympic Stadium, which will have a 65,000-person capacity. There are many infrastructure projects that have been completed recently, and there are a number of projects that are currently under construction. In 2012, Azerbaijan hosted the FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup, and now it is going to host one of the final rounds of the U-17 European Championship 2016. In addition to this, the European Olympic Games will be held in Azerbaijan in 2015. This shows that international sports organizations trust Azerbaijan as a reliable event partner.</p><h4>What are the medium-term plans for AFFA?</h4><p>The main objective of our association is to prepare for the U-17 UEFA European Championship, which will be held in Baku in 2016. We are now training a national team that will represent our country in the tournament. We are planning to establish football academies for some of the big-name football clubs of Azerbaijan in 2013. We are also planning to take part in the bidding process to be a part of the 13 host countries for the UEFA European Championship 2020, and this will be one of our main focuses in the medium term.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does the Jumeirah in Baku differentiate itself in light of increased competition from other international hotel chains?</h4><p>We are the only luxury international city resort in Baku and Azerbaijan, which gives us an advantage to successfully position the Jumeirah Bilgah Beach Hotel in local and international markets. During our opening year in 2012, we hosted a number of cultural and trendsetting events in our unique outdoor venues and state-of-the-art conference facilities. The aim for the future is to continue to deliver on our brand promise of “Stay Different," and ensure memorable experiences for all of our guests. The variety we have to offer for both the leisure and business traveler will definitely differentiate us from the competition. Most importantly, our continued investment in the training and development of our colleagues will ensure that the highest level of service is always on display—as expected from any Jumeirah Hotel around the world.</p><h4>How would you characterize the five-star sector in Baku?</h4><p>The five-star hotel sector has definitely flourished over the last 18 months, with all the major hotel companies coming into Baku. I would say this is a testament to Azerbaijan and Baku for the progress being made in all different areas of the economy, and for being a leading destination in both business and leisure travel in the region. Now, all the five-star international hotels need to keep this positive momentum going forward and add more value to this unique city. Baku is not only a business destination, but also a city with a fascinating history, vibrant arts, and a cultural hub, as well as enhancing the beautiful architecture and embracing its ideal of being a city of the future with many landmark developments approaching completion. I think each of the five-star hotels must work harder, smarter, and also combine their marketing efforts together so that we all are able to assist Baku in fulfilling is potential. At Jumeirah, we consider it both a privilege and an opportunity to be in Baku in such exciting times.</p><h4>Who is the main target for your hotel?</h4><p>The leisure guest is our dominant market. Local guests from Azerbaijan, neighboring CIS countries, and Russia, along with affluent travelers from both the Middle East and Europe, who are looking for an adventurous getaway and cultural expedition will definitely value what Baku and Azerbaijan has to offer. We are also targeting business groups for MICE tourism, and in this regard we are receiving many requests from Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Turkey, Georgia, and local businesses that would like to hold their team-building activities away from the city and on the beautiful shores of the Caspian Sea.</p><h4>Are there any other regions where you are looking to expand the Jumeirah brand?</h4><p>Jumeirah's enviable portfolio now consists of 20 luxury hotels and residences globally. Obviously, the Middle East is an important region for us with Jumeirah's origins in Dubai, and there are further plans for Jordan, Morocco, Qatar, and Egypt. Asia Pacific will also see growth for Jumeirah with a number of properties scheduled for China plus projects announced in Bali, Indonesia, and India. We see Baku as a key gateway city to the CIS and Russia and the success of Jumeirah Bilgah Beach Hotel.</p><h4>How would you describe the current investment climate within the Azerbaijani tourism sector?</h4><p>Azerbaijan is recognized for its rich energy resources and all the business opportunities related to the oil and gas industry. It is very encouraging to see the world coming to Azerbaijan for different purposes, hence the progress and development within the tourism sector. Obviously, because of Azerbaijan's many pure nature reserves, parks, and genuine hospitality culture in the regions, we are seeing more and more investment in regional areas, which is a very promising sign for everybody involved. A few years ago, who would have thought of coming to Azerbaijan for a skiing holiday? Now this is possible. If the positive economic climate continues, then investor confidence in the tourism sector will grow. Investment in tourism means opportunities in many different sectors. The food, agriculture, construction, transportation, telecommunications, and manufacturing industries are all beneficiaries of the tourism sector, and it provides employment opportunities to many young Azerbaijanis. Continued investment in tourism brings continued growth in many different fields, which develops the diversification of the overall economy.</p><h4>It is the 10-year anniversary of President Ilham Aliyev administration in 2013. What developments have you noticed in the country over the past decade?</h4><p>I was fortunate enough to first come to Azerbaijan in mid-2005, and back then I would think to myself that this country was definitely going places. You could feel the energy of a young, dynamic population trying to achieve its potential. Today, after witnessing most of the projects and developments being completed, the commencement of more projects, and after hosting world-class events and organizations in all areas, Azerbaijan is becoming a leader in its region. The vision to do more and continuously improve is the most significant development I can name. I believe that under the vision, leadership, and strategic direction of President Aliyev, there will be continued success and higher levels of prosperity in the future, and we have seen evidence of this over the last 10 years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of Qafqaz Hotels in Azerbaijan, and what is your background within the company?</h4><p>The former President of Azerbaijan, Heydar Aliyev, contributed a great deal to the development of the tourism industry. It is a result of his attention and care that several important events aimed at the development of tourism have taken place in Azerbaijan. One of these has been the establishment of the Gilan Tourism company, a part of Gilan LLC, in 2005. Gilan Tourism includes eight hotels of different categories under the brand name of Qafqaz and a travel agency. I was appointed as General Coordinator of Gilan Tourism in 2008, and I have been working in Azerbaijan in this position for five years now. In that time, I have opened eight hotels. God willing, we will inaugurate two more hotels in Gabala in the near future. Of course, this is a great success not only for Gilan Tourism, but also for Azerbaijan as a whole. Qafqaz has become a recognized brand name, and it is one of Azerbaijan's first hotel chains. At the same time, Qafqaz hotels are also schools. We have provided our staff with comprehensive training on the subtleties of the tourism and hotel sector. As a matter of fact, we are proud that some of our former employees have moved on to join internationally renowned hotels using the training and experience they have obtained at Qafqaz Hotels. As a group, we are working on promoting the brand name of Qafqaz Hotels and Resorts, not only in Azerbaijan, but also around the world. To this end, we participate in annual international tourism exhibitions. However, it is worth noting that Qafqaz Hotels is already known fairly well throughout the world. It is very gratifying indeed that Qafqaz hotels are gaining international recognition as a chain of Azerbaijani hotels. I am very proud of that.</p><h4>How does Qafqaz Hotels in Baku differentiate itself in light of increased competition from international hotel chains?</h4><p>There is a general system of running a hotel business, which is basically the same in all hotels. What differentiates hotels from each other are their standards. When these standards are developed, it is necessary to take into consideration the values and culture of the country in which a hotel operates, as well as the interests and tastes of its people. Many members of our team, including myself, have years of experience in internationally renowned hotel brands. We are trying to combine our international and local experience and take into account the national and spiritual values of the Azerbaijani people to develop what we believe is the standard for Qafqaz Hotels.</p><h4>What does hospitality mean for you?</h4><p>Hospitality is a Latin word meaning “friendliness to guests." For me, hospitality means giving the guests the opportunity to feel important, valuable, happy, and comfortable. Hospitality comes from the heart. We come across guests with different tastes and wishes, and it is not easy to please and satisfy everyone. There are moments when I feel extremely tired, but on seeing smiling and grateful customers I forget it all. No matter how tired we might be, the most important thing for us is to make our guests feel happy and at home in the atmosphere we have created for them. We always try to communicate this motto to our staff in training. Even the smallest detail matters in the hotel business. I always say this to my colleagues. If we want to provide a quality service, we need to pay attention even to the seemingly little details. This is one of the key principles of Qafqaz Hotels. We must show hospitality to our customers not only in words, but also through the expression on our faces and gestures. We often ask our guests why they prefer one hotel or restaurant to another, and the answer always boils down to hospitality, atmosphere, taste of the dishes, and the service.</p><h4>Why was Gabala chosen for Qafqaz Hotels instead of other regions?</h4><p>The largest number of hotels in Azerbaijani districts is concentrated in Gabala. This, however, does not mean that Gabala is the only city where the hotel business is booming. We operate the Qafqaz Sahil Hotel in an area stretching along the Caspian coast, in one of Azerbaijan's most beautiful locations—Lankaran. We intend to open a second hotel in Lankaran in the near future. But why Gabala? I have been asked this question often. Gabala is one of the oldest Azerbaijani cities. I would even call it the heart of Azerbaijan's northern region. Surrounded by the Greater Caucasus and sitting on the banks of the Damiraparan River, Gabala has an amazingly beautiful natural setting—emerald green forests, snow-capped mountains, the rumble of its rivers and waterfalls, mineral water springs, and hundreds of historical monuments. Gabala is also the most developed of Azerbaijani districts. Due to its natural beauty, it has always attracted tourists.</p><h4>Are there any other regions where you have tabled the further expansion of the Qafqaz brand?</h4><p>Azerbaijan is a very diverse country. It is rich in mineral resources, natural beauty, historical and architectural sites, and culture. We always work on improving the quality of our services, and we are certainly interested in setting up hotels in all Azerbaijani districts. This would both enable foreign visitors to discover other regions of the country and facilitate travel for local holidaymakers. God willing, we will commission two magnificent hotels in 2013-2014. One of these will be established in Lankaran in the south of the country and the other in Goygol. We are also working on several hotel projects outside of Azerbaijan at the moment.</p><h4>How involved is Qafqaz Hotels in promoting sports tourism in the regions?</h4><p>In an effort to develop sports tourism and diversify the recreation of tourists staying in our Gabala hotels in winter, we are currently working on a major ski center project. We hope to commission part of the ski center in late January 2013. Also, the rafting and cable park will be put into operation in Gabala in the summer of 2013. Another major project we are working on now is golf tourism. Experts invited from foreign countries are currently working on the project. All of the above will contribute significantly to the development of sports tourism in Azerbaijan.</p><h4>How would you describe the current investment climate within the Azerbaijani tourism sector?</h4><p>Azerbaijan's tourism sector is developing at an unprecedented pace. In the years I have been a part of this industry, I have witnessed numerous activities, projects, and events. Five international five-star hotels have been opened in Baku over the course of one year. Baku has played host to a number of international events and competitions, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism has represented Azerbaijan in all international tourism events, the European Olympic Committee has decided to conduct the inaugural European Olympic Games in Baku in 2015, there have been numerous exhibitions, and many music festivals have been held in Azerbaijan. All these have contributed to the development of tourism in the country. When I first came to Azerbaijan, I came across a phrase by former President Heydar Aliyev in a magazine: “A nation with a high level of culture will always experience progress, will always live and develop…" During the time I have been in Azerbaijan, I have seen how diverse its culture is.</p><h4>What developments have you noticed in the country over the past decade under the Ilham Aliyev administration?</h4><p>I have only seen five years of President Ilham Aliyev's 10-year administration. This period has been one of peace, stability, and security. Azerbaijan is a country where representatives of different ethnicities live together like one family, where people are independent and modern, and the country is dynamically developing. This is an indicator of successful policies carried out by the country's leadership. I feel very happy and proud to work in brotherly Azerbaijan.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of Sinteks MMC in Azerbaijan?<br></h4><p>In 1992 I started a business as an entrepreneur, and by 1996 it had evolved to become Sinteks, a company involved in luxury brands. We had one multi-brand store before we started to represent well-known Western fashion brands through our mono-brand stores. Currently, we have 35 stores in Baku, and since 2008 we have started to move into more mid-market brands. However, our core and main business strategy relies on luxury brands. At the same time, the company has tuned and evolved the luxury brand concept into two larger multi-brand stores called Emporium, one of which is more classic and chic, with renowned brands such as Giorgio Armani and Stella McCarthy. The other is fresh and young, with many young designers from the US, China, Japan, and South Korea.</p><h4>How do you motivate Azerbaijani clients to buy in Baku in the face of fierce competition from Western European “shopping haven" cities such as London, Paris, or Milan?</h4><p>As a luxury company, we face this type of competition. We aim to demonstrate the difference to our clients. When they travel abroad, they are offered a wider variety than what is available here in Baku. Despite this, we are trying to reach the same level and overcome the competition of shops in Europe and even Istanbul. What we strive to offer here in Baku is a personalized VIP service. At our company, we have a special customer-service training program that was established by French and US companies. We implemented this at our store and we are working closely with our customers. We know them directly; this is a small country. Clients are very loyal in Baku, showing that the atmosphere is not like London or Milan, where there are streams of tourists. We are able to offer a precise service to our customers, especially in the luxury segment. This is what we have been doing, and it works. Sometimes it is not only what you buy that matters, but also how you buy it. This is how we struggle against our main competitors; we try to differentiate ourselves to provide the best services adapted to local tastes and specific markets.</p><h4>Which luxury segments are you looking into for further investment?</h4><p>We are currently not involved with any jewelry brands and we only have one department in our store dedicated to that segment, though we may focus on it in the near future. Our company does not only work in Azerbaijan, but it is also in Georgia, Kazakhstan, and Mongolia. We are planning to increase our business in those countries as well. We are not considering the restaurant or hotel business, however; we want the company to be a specialist in its field. I am a retailer who has been involved with the business for 20 years, and I also seek to be a professional. Nowadays, with globalization throughout the world, it is important to be truly specialized and a professional in your field, on both a local and international scale.</p><div class="quote">“We are able to offer a precise service to our customers, especially in the luxury segment."</div><h4>What are your development plans and targets for the business over the medium term?</h4><p>We have several projects we are looking at. We are always looking to bring in more major brands. I believe that in 2013 almost all of the major famous brands will exist in this market. We are now seeking more special concepts for Baku, such as a department store and multi-brand store, similar to the Emporium concept we have now. In Azerbaijan, the tourist stream is in Baku. We see that the majority of department stores are in London or Paris, where there are many tourists. Geographically, we need space as a retail company that specializes in luxury items. We started our activities abroad in Georgia in 2009, and then we expanded to Mongolia and Kazakhstan. The Georgian market is not as strong in terms of luxury brands, but the Mongolian market was surprising for us. Recently, we launched a Burberry store in Kazakhstan in a brand new luxury shopping center alongside all of the major brands. Sinteks also plans to target other Central Asian countries such as Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. It is important to know the market in depth in each country, and we are trying to be more international.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were Bakcell's most important developments in 2012?</h4><p>The biggest and most notable development is our partnership with Manchester United. We are the only partner for Manchester United in the region, and it has provided us a very strong platform with which to take our brand to the next level. It also helps us get recognition more widely outside of Azerbaijan.</p><h4>What strategies led to the decision to enter into a partnership with Manchester United?</h4><p>It is an incredibly well-known brand. It reaches beyond football as the world's premier club; it is the best football team, and we like to think that we are the best mobile operator. The content that Manchester United brings to the partnership and the opportunities we have to leverage its brand among our customers and the broader market as a whole is fantastic. We looked at several other clubs and sports, and the package that Manchester United brought was significantly better than anything other contenders could deliver. We have staged a number of events and a very large launch event, which brought us a large amount of brand recognition. We are currently leveraging content to our customers and also the broader partnership relationship with our corporate customers and opinion-makers in the country.</p><p>Football is a global game; it reaches out and touches people at all levels of society. It is a great way for people to talk and interact, and we like people talking and interacting, especially when they do it on our network. It is a sport that touches people at the senior levels as well as the more mainstream levels; it is a very egalitarian sport and a lot of our brand values relate to the sport. Specifically, Manchester United resonates very well with our own brand values.</p><div class="quote">“Customer numbers for mobile broadband and internet are increasing at an exponential rate."</div><h4>Which market segments have seen the most growth?</h4><p>We have seen a significant growth in data on our network. Data is a very large component of our overall traffic mix. Customer numbers for mobile broadband and internet are increasing at an exponential rate. We are seeing many smart phones on our network, and we have the highest proportion of smart phones of the three operators in the country. Our customers are increasingly using their handsets as a means to access the internet and its content.</p><h4>When do you expect mobile number portability to be fully operational?</h4><p>The Ministry of Communications and Information Technologies is pushing very hard for us, and the whole industry, to launch mobile number portability effectively at the end of 1Q2013. It offers the customers a choice that is different from what they currently have, and we are very supportive of the Ministry's initiatives in this area. We would anticipate being a net winner in portability. For us, a lot of the corporate and higher value customers tend to be with our competitor, Azercell, and are locked into Azercell because of their number. Azercell was launched prior to Bakcell with its GSM services. By way of legacy, it has captured many of the most valuable customers and they are now understandably eager to keep their numbers. Those customers are effectively locked out to us, but portability would allow us to access them. Feedback from the market, and especially from large national corporates, is that there is significant frustration that they can't move, or it is very expensive. Thus, the market is looking forward to portability as well.</p><h4>How do you evaluate the investment climate in the ICT sector?</h4><p>We have had people knocking at our door to work with us. The external view of our sector in Azerbaijan seems to be very positive. We have gone to the market a couple of times to raise bonds, and they were massively oversubscribed, which is encouraging. All of the major vendors are present here and are aggressively competing for business. In general, it is a buoyant place to be. A lot of money is flowing from the oil sector, which is coming into the non-oil sector and attracts investors. There is much infrastructure to build and we have a lot of spectrum to exploit. From our standpoint, we see a good future.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the market for luxury cars in Azerbaijan?<br></h4><p>First of all, I would like to stress that the current circumstances in Azerbaijan allow the opportunity to represent every prestigious automobile brand at a high level. This is primarily the outcome of successful socioeconomic policies that have been conducted by the leadership of Azerbaijan. In addition, the constant increase of the financial living standards of our population and the required infrastructure make it feasible for these prestigious automobile brands to be represented in the best way.</p><h4>How do you compete with several other luxury car brands in a market that is heading toward saturation?</h4><p>We are more than happy to see that luxury automobile brands are being represented in the local market. However, our competition strategy is primarily based on good intentions with strong business activities because healthy competition is the foundation of increasing development. The driving force of demand for Porsche is our customer-oriented approach to individuals and corporations.</p><h4>What challenges exist for the growth of the luxury car market and how is Porsche addressing them?</h4><p>In order to increase the number of vehicles in the market, there have been several types of automobile-oriented events and road shows. For example, the city of Baku hosted one of the largest international automobile events called “City Challenge." As a flagship for luxury cars, Porsche engages in its own specific type of participation during every event.</p><h4>What Porsche models do Azerbaijanis prefer?</h4><p>When buying a car, the Azerbaijani citizen expects and is interested in models such as the Cayenne and Panamera. However, our strategic objective is to match the level of interest toward sports cars as compared to the other popular models.</p><h4>Given that fuel prices in Azerbaijan are extremely low, is there a market for hybrid cars?</h4><p>As a representative of a sports car company, I can assure you that hybrid cars will find a niche in the near future, as ecological standards become essential. This phenomenon encourages the export of hybrid automobiles. When the time comes, our hybrid Porsche will be ready at the forefront of this technology.</p><h4>What are your growth objectives for Porsche in 2013?</h4><p>Considering the increased interest in the Porsche brand worldwide, we expect similar results here in Azerbaijan. From my perspective, the variations in the range of Porsche models for 2013 will speed up the development process as expected.</p><h4>What have been the most signiï¬cant changes to the investment landscape in Azerbaijan during President Ilham Aliyev's term?</h4><p>Throughout the leadership years of the honorable President Aliyev, the country's economic indicators have grown exponentially. Since 2003, our government and our nation have achieved unbelievable success in the social sphere, as well as in every other area of development. Huge amounts of money have been invested in various sectors of economy. Furthermore, Azerbaijan has established industries with strong backgrounds and foundations and over 1 million jobs have been created. This has been directly affecting the living standards of the population and increases hope for a prosperous future. I strongly believe that the President will continue to lead our nation into a thriving future.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the market for Kia cars in Azerbaijan?<br></h4><p>If we analyze the market for the sale of new cars, we can see that in 2012 the market expanded by 30% in comparison with 2007. If we also compare the sales of Kia cars over these years, we observe an eight fold increase. Over a short period of time, the Kia brand has settled in third place and is now very close to becoming the second best selling brand in the market. It would be no mistake to say that Kia cars are very popular and prestigious in Azerbaijan. Therefore, one can conclude that the balance between the prices and technical characteristics of our models is optimal. We see this as one of the main reasons for such a dramatic increase in our sales. Generally speaking, as is the case with the markets of other countries, it is possible to follow the trend in Azerbaijan's car market. People give preference to not very expensive, practical, and, at the same time, good-looking cars. The growing international popularity of Kia cars is the result of the company's efforts to meet these criteria.</p><h4>How do you compete with and differentiate yourself from the many other car distributors in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Azerbaijan has been one of the world's most dynamically developing countries for the past several years. The purchasing power of the population has significantly increased. Accordingly, demand should also be at a high level. Therefore, we have to acknowledge that since demand exceeds supply in Azerbaijan's new cars market, it may be wrong to say that there is tough competition. We can't meet this demand. One of the reasons for that is the growing popularity of Kia cars throughout the world. In 2012, the company exceeded its manufacturing plan by 130%, but if it hadn't been for the shortage of cars, this indicator could have been even higher. At the same time, we understand that we have to take this opportunity to expand our sales and service networks. From this point of view, 2012 was a very successful year as we succeeded in opening a large service center in the country's second biggest city. As to how we differentiate ourselves from others, we try to proceed from the standpoint of our customer's comfort. Customer satisfaction is the driving force of our everyday work. The key measure of success in our business is not tangible and cannot be measured with money. It is our attitude to customers that has no unit of measure and is the key to our success.</p><h4>Over the past year, which models have seen the most popularity in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>According to the results of 2012, the most popular models were the Cerato, Sportage, Rio, Optima, and Sorento. As for growth in sales, we can nominate the Sorento, Cerato, Cadenza, Picanto, and Optima. The preferences of Azerbaijani customers are fairly stable. The sales of the Picanto model have also steadily increased. This attests to the fact that the number of women driving cars is on the increase. The most memorable premiere of 2012 was the introduction of the Quoris, a model that belongs to a completely new market segment. This model has a unique design, is based on the latest technologies, and is highly comfortable. We started offering it at the end of 2011 and the result has exceeded our expectations. This is evidence of the fact that people already perceive Kia as part of the premium market segment.</p><h4>What are your growth objectives for 2013?</h4><p>In 2013, in an effort to address customer demand, we intend to increase the number of our sales and service centers. Most importantly, though, we plan to bring our market share to 18% and compete to become the second biggest market player. We will be aided in this by the introduction of the latest generation of such models as Cee'd, Cerato, Carens, and Soul in 2013.</p><h4>What have been the most significant changes in Azerbaijan's investment landscape over the past decade?</h4><p>Regarding investments, I would like to approach this question from a different angle. In my view, the Ilham Aliyev administration has identified the most important spheres for investment. The economic and military power of the state, its international reputation, and the social and economic prosperity of the population are growing. In other words, investment is channeled into the country as a whole and its people.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the investment climate for international investors in the media sector?<br></h4><p>First, I would like to note that Azerbaijan has a dynamically developing economy with a large consumer market and solvent demand. The country has a unique geographical position and possesses rich natural resources that promise huge revenues. All the conditions of a favorable investment climate have been ensured. The investments worth tens of billions of dollars made in Azerbaijan testify to the fact that local and foreign investors are showing interest in the country in terms of attractiveness. I believe the low investment risk associated with financial and socio-political stability refer to Azerbaijan's investment advantages. As for the media sector, anyone can run a media outlet without licensing.</p><h4>How does AzerNews deal with the challenges of press freedom in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>In my opinion, the decisions taken to ensure freedom of speech and the press in Azerbaijan over the past few years have significantly promoted a solution to many challenges in this sphere. There are no restrictions on operating media in the country, and media outlets function without licensing. Azerbaijan's media is the most developed in the region. It is so gratifying to note that 156 media outlets were registered in Azerbaijan in 2012 alone. The total number of registered media outlets exceed 4,700. The approval of a defamation law, which the Azerbaijani government put up for public discussion, will relieve journalists of criminal responsibility. There is no problem with freedom of speech and the press in Azerbaijan. The Azerbaijani media, including AzerNews, immediately reacts to any serious issue in society.</p><h4>How is AzerNews expanding given the increasing expatriate population here in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>The sustainable economic development of Azerbaijan makes our country attractive to foreigners, whose numbers have increased each year. Azerbaijan has built many hotels and is prepared to receive the increasing number of tourists. AzerNews, with a predominantly international audience, is keen to guide the country's expatriate population deep into the economic, social, and political life of Azerbaijan, and satisfy their interest in the national culture and history. Taking into consideration the variety of sectors foreigners are involved in, we focus on different fields of the economy: business, the ICT sector, and tourism. AzerNews tries to serve as the best source of information for the expatriate community and strengthen as an online media outlet.</p><h4>What will be the topics to look out for on the Azerbaijani news agenda in 2013?</h4><p>I think the upcoming year will be a very important period in the country's social and political life. Azerbaijan will hold presidential elections in 2013 in accordance with the Election Code. Coverage of this important event will be the top priority, along with highlighting the socioeconomic and political life of the country. The unresolved Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, which emerged as a result of Armenia's territorial claims on Azerbaijan, will remain the top of the Azerbaijani news agenda in 2013. AzerNews will continue its efforts on informing the international community about Azerbaijan's fair position on the conflict and violation of the rights of over 1 million Azerbaijani refugees, who were ousted from their homes during the war with Armenia in the 1990s. At the same time, encouraging the development of the tourism sector will be another topic high on the agenda.</p><h4>What are your medium-term plans for AzerNews?</h4><p>AzerNews is keen to become a leading regional newspaper fully covering the South Caucasus, the Middle East, and Central Asia. To become a reliable source of information and reference is a challenge for us. AzerNews is also eager to further develop its website by using advanced technology. Our newspaper will become more active on social networking sites, including Facebook and Twitter. We strive to increase traffic and become more popular for references by our numerous readers. Our focus is on expanding subscriptions through electronic systems, including NewspaperDirect, where AzerNews is represented now. The latest news is posted on the website, social networks, and the iPad. Nevertheless, the printed version is still valuable for me personally and our team.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of Holcim Azerbaijan?<br></h4><p>The Garadagh Cement Plant was established according to a decree by the USSR Council of Ministers in 1949. It was the largest enterprise in the Caucasus countries in terms of cement production capacity. Starting with two wet kiln lines, it increased to four lines very quickly. In 1999, Holcim entered Azerbaijan through the privatization of Garadagh Cement shares. New management and technology-enhanced plant performance meant that production volumes reached 900,000 tons in 2003 and 1.3 million tons in 2005. Holcim Azerbaijan received a privatization certificate based on the government's requirements in 2007. Today, Holcim is the majority shareholder with a 70% stake. Azerbaijan Investment Company (AIC) and EBRD hold 10% each and the other minority shareholders comprise the remaining 10%. In 2008, Holcim's Board of Directors approved a modernization project for the plant in Azerbaijan. Even though it was during a period of global financial crisis, Holcim successfully invested ‚¬330 million. Holcim replaced the old wet kiln with a single, new, state-of-the-art dry kiln line. At the time, it was the largest investment in the non-oil sector of Azerbaijan. The implementation of advanced technology increases cement production capacity, lowers the impact on the environment, decreases gas and dust emissions, and creates an opportunity to use alternative fuel resources for a sustainable production cycle. In April 2009, we organized a groundbreaking ceremony for the new dry kiln line, which was opened in July 2012.</p><h4>What strategies led to the decision for Garadagh Cement to be rebranded as Holcim Azerbaijan?</h4><p>We had long considered Holcim the main shareholder of Garadagh Cement. The decision to rebrand was made for various reasons. In 2012, Holcim completed the reconstruction of a new plant with the capacity to produce 1.7 million tons of cement. The modernized state-of-the-art kiln raised standards and quality. We became part of the Holcim Group and fully responded to international standards by establishing quality and sustainable development principles. The name of Garadagh is a geographic location, and this name is still used in product brands of Holcim Azerbaijan, such as Garadagh Optimal, Garadagh Special, Garadagh Expert, Garadagh Spring, and Garadagh Solid. Currently, in Azerbaijan, the Holcim brand effectively contributes to the high-quality, sustainable development of the local construction industry.</p><h4>As the largest cement manufacturer in Azerbaijan, who are your main clients and what market are you targeting?</h4><p>Holcim Azerbaijan is the leading company with high-quality products in the local cement market and technical solution support. Holcim Azerbaijan is the preferred cement supplier for professional customers involved in construction projects initiated and supported by the government as well as by private investors. Holcim is stimulating and strengthening the interest of its customers through high-quality products and compliance mechanisms, testing and certification programs carried out at local and international laboratories, and on-time logistics services. We are a partner of our customers throughout entire construction projects, from tendering and engineering to building and post-construction. We work together with our customers to devise mixed designs and generate optimum value and performance. Each customer plays a significant role and contributes to the Holcim Azerbaijan business model.</p><h4>What are some of the activities of the Holcim Foundation with regard to sustainable development?</h4><p>We have 100 years of experience in this region, and we were the first company to introduce modern technology and high-performance standards toward sustainable development and sustainable construction. We always go beyond our core business. The Holcim Foundation works closely with diverse stakeholders, including academics and experts, to continuously create innovative approaches for sustainable development. Sustainable construction aims to meet present-day needs for housing, working environments, and infrastructure, without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. It incorporates elements of economic efficiency, environmental performance, and social responsibility, and contributes to the greatest extent when architectural quality, technical innovation, and transferability are included. We select and support initiatives that combine sustainable construction solutions with architectural excellence and an enhanced quality of life, beyond simple technical solutions. An emphasis is put on progress, people, the planet, prosperity, and proficiency.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the roots of Azersun Holding and its ties to Azerbaijan?<br></h4><p>Azerbaijan is a young, but rapidly developing country walking with vigorous strides toward its goals. For more than 70 years, Azerbaijan was a part of the Soviet Union. In the past, the countries included in the Union were connected by close economic relations. However, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Azerbaijan gained its independence under conditions of economic and political crisis. Reforms were carried out in the country within a short period of time after the return of great political leader Heydar Aliyev. These reforms resulted in the renovation of the overall infrastructure of the country. Owing to the decrees of the President and the decisions passed by the government, a favorable entrepreneurial environment was established in the country. The high intellectual culture of the population redounded to the mastering of the management of the new technology we brought. As a result, we succeeded in establishing modern production enterprises capable of meeting the demands of the region. The geographic location, natural resources, large industrial component, as well as the intellectual and economic potential of Azerbaijan provided numerous opportunities for the country. Thanks to the successful continuation of the political course by President Ilham Aliyev, rapid development has been maintained and remarkable progress has been achieved in all fields of the country. For the purpose of developing the economy, especially the non-oil sector, a large number of new programs have been developed and business opportunities have been enhanced day by day. The adopted laws ensured the establishment of a favorable business environment in Azerbaijan, and, at the same time, encouraged the involvement of foreign investments in the country and the free activity of foreign companies in the Republic.</p><h4>What have been some of the major achievements of the company?</h4><p>I am confident to say that Azersun Holding enhances its business activities, opens new places of work, and develops day by day. Our business traditions in quality management, health, safety, and the environment are continuously developing. From the point of view of development, we appreciate the business environment established in the country and the assistance and support provided by the government for the enhancement of entrepreneurial activity, and we believe that such cooperation will play a significant role in the future development of our business. We aspire to the stable development of the non-oil sector that will provide innovations and benefits for the developing economy of Azerbaijan. The production capacity of Imishli sugar refinery, Masazir salt factory, Kurdamir dairy complex, Bilasuvar canning plant, Qazax canning plant, and the waste-paper recycling complex that we established in recent years enables us to meet the demands of not only Azerbaijan, but also other countries of the region. Our Azersun Agricultural Products enterprise, equipped with the newest models of agricultural technology, is a complex that has no equivalent in the region.</p><h4>What are Azersun's medium-term plans?</h4><p>Azersun Holding will continue contributing to the development of the food industry in Azerbaijan as the executor of huge agricultural projects and set the continuous development of the domestic production standards of Azerbaijan as its key objective. For the purpose of achieving this goal, we attach the utmost importance to the improvement of the professional skills of our staff, ensuring the competitiveness of our enterprises and the high quality of our products.</p><div class="quote">“We aspire to the stable development of the non-oil sector that will provide innovations and benefits for the developing economy of Azerbaijan."</div>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you rate viticulture in Azerbaijan compared to other countries in the region?</h4><p>Grapes are one of the most ancient and revered fruits in the world. Grapes have enchanted people with their elegance and beauty from time immemorial. Numerous archeological excavations carried out on Azerbaijani territory and the written heritage of ancient and medieval travelers, historians, and geographers, including Homer, Herodotus, Strabo, Colimelli, Hovgal, Masudi, and al-Muqaddasi provide evidence that Azerbaijan has always been noted for its tradition of viticulture. Although the foundations of industrial winemaking in Azerbaijan were laid in the middle of the 19th century, it only started to develop as a sector in 1969. National leader Heydar Aliyev, who later became the President of the Republic, made a number of important decisions to facilitate the development of viticulture. As a result of the measures taken, whereas in 1969 vineyards covered 57,100 hectares, they reached an area of 210,000 hectares in 1984. While in 1969 only 240,300 tons of grapes were cultivated, in 1984 the figure exceeded 2 million tons. This enabled Azerbaijan not only to overtake neighboring republics but also become the USSR's leader in the production of grapes. In 1985, the USSR leadership passed measures to eliminate drunkenness and alcoholism, thus dealing a major blow to viticulture and winemaking. After the great leader returned to power in Azerbaijan, the Law on Viticulture and Winemaking and a number of other regulatory and legal acts were adopted in 2002. In addition, on December 15, 2011, President Ilham Aliyev signed into act a state program on the development of viticulture in Azerbaijan for 2012-2020. The program outlines prospects for the development of viticulture in the country. Specific instructions were issued to relevant public agencies to facilitate the development of the sector. Funds for the development of viticulture have been allocated from the state budget, the National Fund on Entrepreneurship Support, and through private investment. No other country in the region has approved such comprehensive public programs on the development of viticulture. The nine climatic zones available in Azerbaijan make it possible to plant and cultivate high-quality grapes in soils not requiring irrigation. Therefore, in comparison to other countries in the region, Azerbaijan has extensive opportunities for the development of viticulture, and we hope that this sector will soon become a leader of national agriculture.</p><h4>How is Azerbaijani wine perceived globally, and what needs to be done in order to increase its brand image?</h4><p>In the heyday of viticulture and winemaking in Azerbaijan in the 1970s and 1980s, Azerbaijani wines won two grand prix, 46 gold, 49 silver, and three bronze medals at various international and All-Union tasting exhibitions and festivals. Most of the wines produced in the Republic at the time—around 92%-95%—were unclarified and the rest were natural. Now, this proportion has changed in favor of natural wines. The change in proportion has also had an impact on the fame of Azerbaijani wine. The fact that grapes accounted for the biggest share of food exports from Azerbaijan in 2011 attests to a trend that new varieties of Azerbaijani wine are becoming increasingly recognized around the world. In order to enhance the brand image of Azerbaijani wine, it is necessary to ensure its original and individual nature. Some of the key measures to this end would include the effective utilization of more than 300 indigenous grape varieties cultivated in Azerbaijan's nine climatic zones, the production of wine based on recognized grape varieties, the use of oak casks in the storage of wines in cellars, the restoration of the country's previously renowned wine brands, and the development of new ones. We also think it is important to create a synergy of classic and modern technologies and use state-of-the-art equipment and bottling techniques.</p><h4>How will domestic awareness and the appreciation of wine change in future years?</h4><p>Azerbaijan is expected to significantly expand its vineyards and subsequently the production of grapes and wines in the near future—vineyards are expected to increase from 16,000 to 50,000 hectares by 2020. Since the production of wine will significantly exceed domestic consumption, it is necessary to explore foreign markets. In order to increase domestic consumption, it is necessary to get rid of the legacy of Soviet stereotyping and take effective measures to change public preferences. It is also necessary to inform the population about the nutritional and medicinal properties of wine. To achieve this, it might be useful to conduct various festivals, open tasting shows, and run campaigns to promote winemakers and their wines and improve public awareness in the wine-making districts of the Republic.</p><div class="quote">“No other country in the region has approved such comprehensive public programs on the development of viticulture."</div><h4>What is your total yearly production and how much of that is exported?</h4><p>As is the case with any business, the managers of Ganja Sharab-2 are taking measures to develop the company, improve the quality of products, and increase the volume of production. To this end, the company has purchased and installed the latest processing equipment. A total of AZN1.6 million, or around $2 million, has been spent on this in the first nine months of 2012. As a result, the quality of our products has dramatically improved and the demand for them has increased. A total of 390,500 decaliters of wine was produced in the first 10 months of 2012. An analysis of the last seven years shows that the production of wine has increased by 178,300 decaliters. Issues relating to exports are always the focus of our management. In the same time period, a total of 214,100 decaliters of wine was exported, or six times more than in the same period of 2005. Our wines are exported to the Russian Federation and Ganja Sharab-2 is currently in talks with other countries regarding exports.</p><h4>How would you characterize the investment climate for viticulture in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Viticulture and winemaking hold a special place in the industrial sector. They are important to the national economy in terms of value-added and economic efficiency. At the same time, viticulture is a capital-intensive industry that requires major investment. Appreciating the exceptional importance of viticulture to the national economy, the country's leadership is attaching special importance to this sector. The various public programs that have been adopted to date identify viticulture as a priority area. In addition to the fact that the establishment of vineyards requires significant investment, major expenses are also necessary to support the vines until they bear fruit. The timely procurement of grapes is also highly important. The State Program on the Development of Viticulture in the Republic of Azerbaijan, adopted by the government, aims to resolve these problems and facilitate the development of viticulture and winemaking. The program lays down the main directions for the development of viticulture and winemaking and spells out funding sources. These measures have created a favorable investment climate for the development of viticulture in Azerbaijan.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does your company do to help animals?<br></h4><p>This is a non-profit organization. To put it simply, we pick up stray or homeless cats and dogs and bring them here. We treat them, feed them, clean them, and make sure they are vaccinated and sterilized if they are in a healthy condition. Then, we try to find them homes. First we rescue them from the streets, then we try to get them adopted so that, ideally, they find a home. That is our main function.</p><h4>How do you make people aware of the adoption process?</h4><p>We started by launching campaigns because we were just getting ready. We are very new, and we have recently moved since someone donated some land to Vefali Dostlar. Starting in January 2013, we are working with a very good company that does our marketing and advertising in order to give us exposure. They know who we are, what we do, and what our aim is. Our aim is to control the population of stray animals on the streets of Azerbaijan.</p><h4>Do you work with government organizations?</h4><p>Not at the moment. We have not had any government support so far, but we have not approached it either. We wanted to do everything and invest ourselves in this project and show it that we really mean to do just charity here. We are hoping that when we are more exposed and people know about us the government will take our hand, not just in financial ways, but in legal ways; in the way of legislating some animal laws, such as laws against animal cruelty, because animal rights are very weak at the moment. We hope to foster a culture of animal loving within children. We are also hoping to have school groups visit us in the future so the children can see animals and be able to touch them, love them, and learn that animals are precious.</p><div class="quote">“We hope to foster a culture of animal loving within children."</div><h4>What are you doing to reduce the number of stray animals in the long term?</h4><p>We have a program called “spay and neuter," which every shelter in the world does. It is the most important thing a shelter does. We sterilize these animals so they can't reproduce on the streets and the population is controlled. That is the first thing. We do it ourselves, and we do it free of charge for anyone who brings their animals here, pets or strays.</p><h4>What are the current attitudes toward pets in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>I have lived in Azerbaijan for 20 years, and in the past four or five years I have started to see more pets, especially small dogs. This trend is definitely growing. About 20 years ago, no one had a dog unless they had a large garden or they had a guard dog. Now, I see people in the city with tiny dogs, and that is good; it is animal loving. It is a trend with little dogs, but it is better than before, at least they are learning to live with animals and be kind to them. Even if it is a trend, it is an improvement.</p><h4>What advice would you give to the general public when it comes to taking care of animals on the streets?</h4><p>When you are walking or driving in the street, look around and you will see a kitten that is cold or a puppy that is hungry. For us to solve this problem, we must sterilize our animals so they don't reproduce unwanted offspring. Sterilize your animals and be kind to them. They are kind, innocent, and they won't hurt us unless we hurt them.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the changes in Azerbaijan over the last 10 years during President Ilham Aliyev's tenure?</h4><p>Honestly, I have seen so much change in Azerbaijan. Each year has progressed more toward becoming better than a European country. The level of progress has been so fast and the culture has changed so much. The way people think, dress, and act are completely different. The progress in this country is unbelievable. Every time I take a trip and come back, I see the city has developed further. I hope that with this rate of progress, Azerbaijan will go forward and be better than every other country. We are moving toward becoming the Paris of the Caucasus.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the major developments of the Ministry in recent years?</h4><p>One of the most graphic examples of the President's social policies is the development of health care. A number of highly important legislative acts, state programs, and other regulatory documents have been passed under the direct leadership of the President. Major reforms have been implemented in recent years to improve healthcare management, strengthen the material and technical logistics of medical institutions, introduce cutting-edge technology, and dramatically change personnel policies. This, in turn, has enabled Azerbaijan's healthcare system to develop in accordance with international standards, embarking on a path of consistent integration into the healthcare systems of the world's leading countries, and to significantly improve the reputation of Azerbaijani healthcare internationally. The dynamic development over recent years also continued in 2012, which was reflected in the improvement of demographic and health indicators. A comparative analysis of the last 10 years shows that the birth rate has increased from 13.9 to 17.4 per 1,000 people, while the mortality rate has dropped from 6.0 to 5.3. The natural increase of the population has risen from 7.9 to 12.1, which is the highest indicator in Europe. Budget allocations to health care have increased by more than 11 times in comparison with 2003, to constitute AZN660 million in 2013. The allocations from the state budget and the public investment fund have enabled the Ministry to establish medical centers that use state-of-the-art technology and are fitted with cutting-edge medical equipment. About 500 medical facilities have been built or renovated over the last decade. Of these, about 70% are located in the countryside. These include the National Cancer Center, the National Ophthalmology Center named after academic Zarifa Aliyeva, the Scientific Surgery Center named after A. Topchubashov, the National Perinatal Center, the National Urological Hospital named after M. Javadzadeh, the Azerbaijan Medical University clinics, the Clinical Medical Center, the National Clinical Hospital for Children, the Children's Neurological Hospital, and many other major health facilities. In 2012 alone, a total of 76 medical institutions were built or renovated. Of these, 40 were located in Baku and 36 in regional areas. Renovation and overhaul has been carried out at 24 medical institutions (13 in Baku and 11 in the regions), and they have been put into operation. Since 2005, a total of 11 state programs targeting priority healthcare sectors have been adopted, and their implementation is successfully underway. A total of AZN387.7 million has been spent on the execution of healthcare programs over the past 10 years.</p><h4>What progress has been made by the Ministry with regard to treating people with hereditary diseases?</h4><p>As a result of the measures taken by state programs, the level of medical service provided to mothers and children, patients suffering from oncologic disorders, endocrinological issues, hereditary blood diseases, kidney insufficiency, and so forth has dramatically improved. The diagnosing quality of these diseases has also substantially increased, and the supply of medicine has improved. As a result, performance indicators regarding this type of service have significantly increased. For the first time in Azerbaijan, as part of a diabetes program, diabetic patients have been provided with self-control resources including glucose meters and strips. Moreover, the perennial problem with the provision of diabetic patients with medicines has now been resolved. As a result of these measures, the level of diabetes identification has increased, while the number of registered diabetic patients has risen by 3.6 times since 2003 to reach 180,000 people. In addition, the morbidity rate among diabetic patients has dropped from 21.7 to 7.5 per 100,000 people.</p><h4>What developments have come to light with regard to treating cancer patients in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>The adoption of the “State Program on the Provision of Oncologic Patients with Medicines for Malignant Tumors" has led to significant progress in fighting cancer. The material and technical logistics and infrastructure of hospitals providing cancer treatment has substantially improved. The National Oncology Center has been provided with the latest medical equipment, including a mobile diagnostic unit. President Aliyev attended the groundbreaking ceremony for a new building of this center personally. It has now been built and put into operation. As a result of these measures, the identification of cancer patients has dramatically improved and the morbidity rate among cancer patients has dropped from 62.1 to 59 per 100,000 people.</p><div class="quote">“About 500 medical facilities have been built or renovated over the last decade."</div><h4>What measures have been taken to improve the quality of medical services offered in Azerbaijan's maternal wards?</h4><p>A priority of the government's social policy is to improve the quality of medical services provided to mothers and children. As a result of the direct involvement of the country's leadership, major strides have been made in this area in recent years as well. The adoption of the state program on the protection of the mother and child, the introduction of electronic health cards, and immunological prophylaxis of infectious diseases has contributed a great deal to the protection of maternal and child health. To demonstrate our special focus and attention in this area, the Ministry established a total of seven perinatal centers in the republic, including in the city of Baku and the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, as well as reconstructing and completing a major overhaul of the National Children's Hospital and the second and third Baku clinical hospitals for children, the Children's Neurological Hospital, the Children's Cancer and Cardio Surgery Centers, and many other facilities providing medical services for children. All of the children's outpatient clinics in Baku have been fully renovated and fitted with state-of-the-art medical equipment in recent years. As a result of these activities, indicators describing maternal and child health in the country have dramatically improved. Whereas in 2003 the rate of infant mortality was 16.7, in 2012 it dropped to 10.8 per 1,000 people. The rate of maternal mortality dropped from 18.5 in 2003 to 14.9 in 2012.</p><h4>What is the Ministry doing in order to prevent the spread of infectious diseases in the country?</h4><p>Significant achievements have been made as a result of measures taken by the Ministry of Health to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. The timely inoculation of children has played a key role in preventing the spread of infectious diseases. As is the case in developed countries in Europe, children in Azerbaijan are inoculated against 10 potential diseases. The start of inoculation against pneumonia is expected to commence in the near future. It is worth indicating that inoculation against four infectious diseases was introduced only in the last 10 years. The national inoculation plan reaches about 96%-98% of the targeted population every year.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-brighter-future]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the major developments within the Ministry over 2012?</h4><p>In recent years, a number of major changes have been implemented in the education system of Azerbaijan. One of the major developments we had was the improvement of the infrastructure of the education system, including the construction of new buildings for schools and higher education institutions. For example, over the last decade 2,400 new school buildings have been constructed or repaired. This amounts to more than 50% of the schools functioning in Azerbaijan. All of these schools were equipped with the necessary, modern equipment in order to ensure efficient learning and teaching. One of the important issues is that starting from 2012, forcedly displaced people who were accommodated in the hostels of the universities are being gradually moved to new buildings constructed specifically for them in different areas of Baku city. This is not only for university hostels, but also for kindergarten, school, and college buildings. Another important point is that over the last few years, the construction of the legislative basis of education has continued. It is very important because our education system previously functioned as an integral part of the Soviet education system, but now our education system is developing on the basis of national legislation. Starting in 2008, we have completely changed the content of secondary education and started the introduction of a national curriculum. Five years ago, we started the introduction of a new curriculum in the first grade of general schools, and now the new curriculum is used in grades one to five. You might ask, what is this innovation about, what is the difference between the previous curriculum and the new one? The main difference in the curriculum that we had and what we have now is that the previous curriculum was only based on the memory of the students. They only had to memorize what they were taught, but now the new curriculum stimulates the development of the logic capabilities of the child, and their critical thinking and life skills. It is easy to say it in a sentence, but it is very difficult to implement. We started publishing new textbooks based on this curriculum and distributed them free of charge to schools. At the same time, based on the new curriculum, we organized training courses for teachers at schools and universities. We also initiated a new evaluation system.</p><p>Another major development is the introduction of ICT into the education system. When we started this process, we had only one computer for every 1,044 children in our secondary schools, but now this indicator is one computer for every 20 children. At the same time, we also conduct special training courses for teachers on computer skills. These courses are conducted at schools, and more than 50% of teachers have already attended these courses. Another vital issue that I'd like to point out is the management of the education system. Previously, we had a centralized system where education was managed by one center. Now, the system is more decentralized and the education institutions are governed not from the center, but by the local communities and authorities. At the same time, we managed to improve the independence of the universities. This also means that we attract parents into the management of educational institutions. In Azerbaijan, parent-school associations have been established, and through the activities of these associations parents are broadly involved in the process of management. Out of the 4,500 schools that we have in the country, more than 2,000 became members of this association, and this number is growing.</p><h4>What changes are occurring to the way that education in the country is being financed?</h4><p>Over the past few years, there have been some serious changes to way the education system is financed. For example, we are now transferring to a per-capita financing system, and we are continuing our joint project with the World Bank aimed at the introduction of this system in our secondary schools. The majority of higher education institutions are independent and financed directly by the government. It is very important to provide teachers and managers with the opportunity and necessary conditions for continuous education. A specialized curriculum for teachers has been developed for continuous education, and it is implemented on the basis of this curriculum. The attention to the development of education from the President of Azerbaijan is increasing every year, and the funds allocated to education are also rising as well. Teacher salaries are likewise increasing, and their social protection is improving. The role of the Heydar Aliyev Foundation in the construction of school buildings for disabled children and the development of inclusive education should be emphasized. Over 10,000 Azerbaijani youth are now receiving their education abroad. Out of this amount, about 2,000 students are financed within the framework of the “State Program on Study for Azerbaijani Youth Abroad for 2007-2015." We are planning to increase this number to 5,000 by 2015. The state also finances a further 2,000 young people on the basis of an exchange program between universities. There are also more students studying abroad on a self-support basis. At the same time, the number of foreign students studying in Azerbaijan's higher education institutions is increasing. At present, about 7,000 foreign students receive their education in our universities.</p><div class="quote">“Our education system is developing on the basis of national legislation."</div><h4>How would you evaluate the importance of ICT solutions in education?</h4><p>It is very important, and it is an issue that President Ilham Aliyev has particularly focused on. Recently, the President adopted “Azerbaijan 2020: The Vision of the Future," a development concept. The introduction of ICT has been given a very important role in this concept. Within the framework of introducing ICT in education, we closely cooperate with world-famous companies such as Microsoft, Intel, and Cisco. We implemented a new project aimed at the provision of a computer for each student. E-school is another project that we are developing. This project is very much welcomed by both students and teachers. From one side, we are broadening the opportunities for teachers and students to receive up-to-date information, and at the same time they have an opportunity to get acquainted with modern teaching methodologies.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Bilgi University grown and developed since it was founded?</h4><p>Bilgi was one of the first in the second wave of universities founded in Turkey. Its story goes back a bit further to the time of private universities, because private universities were not allowed to set up. Initially, the school was set up as a private university that was doing dual-degrees with UK universities. It was established by nine founders who were not entrepreneurs; they were simply in love with education. They wanted to set up a university in Istanbul to introduce a synergy between the poorly served neighborhoods and wealthy students. It serves the A+ to A category in terms of non-scholarship students. Since 2009, we have been a very highly perceived social science university. Because of the competition in mass education, we decided to become a fully comprehensive, national university rather than an Istanbul city university. We added engineering, architecture, health sciences, and many Master's and PhD degrees. For the first time in Turkey, we created a bilateral exchange agreement with the University of Liverpool in the UK. We were the first to do so in a foundation university. And we were the first to do a 3+1 degree in Turkey, where you study three years here and spend your final year in the UK, ultimately receiving two accredited degrees. It was a major accomplishment. We have seven such degrees available now, and we want to grow in that area.</p><h4>How would you characterize Bilgi University's approach to education?</h4><p>Since its foundation, Bilgi has attempted to establish a cultural and scientific community that promotes tolerance and respect for a diverse amount of individuals with different lifestyles, beliefs, and ways of thinking, within the framework of contemporary universal values, while at the same time maintaining strong ties with all segments of society. The Bilgi community includes more than just students; it also includes faculty, alumni, families, employers, and neighboring communities where Bilgi is located. Being part of the Laureate International Universities Network, the founding premise of Bilgi has come “to make education more accessible and affordable so that more students can pursue their dreams." Bilgi seeks to educate free-thinking, creative, intellectually curious, and enterprising individuals who will contribute to a world in which knowledge is accessible to all and, indeed, in which access to it has come to be seen as a fundamental human right. Bilgi holds a primary responsibility for providing, maintaining, and further developing an academic environment in which both students and faculty members are able to engage in learning and the production of knowledge at the highest level.</p><h4>What is the significance of Azerbaijan for Bilgi University?</h4><p>Azerbaijan-Turkey relations have been strong, with the two often being described as “one people, two states," due to a common culture and history, and the mutual intelligibility of the Turkish and Azerbaijani languages. Turkey has been a staunch supporter of Azerbaijan in its efforts to consolidate its independence and preserve its territorial integrity. Azerbaijan has always been the leading student provider to Bilgi. Linguistic affinity is one of the most important advantages for Azerbaijani students to get acquainted with the local society since English is still not the second language within the public, even though Bilgi is an English-medium university. The historical and special connections of the two countries also provide a stable ground for prospect partnerships. The close proximity of the two countries makes Bilgi a favorable choice, especially for families. Istanbul, of course, is a location preferred by Azerbaijani youth, and Bilgi offers the highest quality academic services as well as social, cultural, and economic support to all Azerbaijani applicants. Among other foundation universities, Bilgi announced the first international student scholarship for Azerbaijani students. To be honest, even though our Azerbaijani students carry a different passport, we feel that they are an irrefutable part of our family. We will carry on accepting satisfactory numbers of students from Azerbaijan who will be the leaders of tomorrow starting their professional life at Bilgi.</p><div class="quote">“Bilgi seeks to educate free-thinking, creative, intellectually curious, and enterprising individuals."</div><h4>How does Bilgi University tailor its educational offerings to appeal to students from Azerbaijan?</h4><p>We have representatives in Baku and we visit Azerbaijan at least five times a year. We visit high schools and other private education establishments and try to recruit academically successful candidates. We do road shows from one city to another to interview prospective students, and then host them in Istanbul for the duration of their studies. More importantly, we have private outreach and marketing campaigns specifically tailored for Azerbaijan every year. Countries that recruit hundreds and thousands of international students acknowledge students as a lucrative source of income. At Bilgi, this is exactly the opposite. We offer satisfactory tuition scholarships to appeal to international students. The purpose of the scholarship is to provide our students an environment where they can interact with others in the English language. We are very certain that our university provides the optimum international opportunities both in Turkey and abroad. We make sure that all of our students take advantage of our exchange and partnership agreements with over 300 leading institutions all over the world. There are dual-degree options as well as other student placement exchange occasions for one or two semesters. All of our students are expected to take advantage of these opportunities during their undergraduate studies.</p><h4>Why are international links important to Bilgi?</h4><p>Education cannot be separate from the world. The very word “universe" is part of “university," which is number one. Number two is opportunity; we want students to experience different cultures. The same concept I mentioned domestically is true internationally and is related to understanding different perspectives. It is important to understand even those who you may not like and get to know where they are coming from. There may be disputes and issues, but that is why Bilgi wants to unify students and connect the Laureate network. Furthermore, we wanted to build a true network, not just an exchange program, so that we are on one campus but utilizing multiple campuses worldwide under the same conditions. I think that is the main difference that we aim to make. International students contribute varied perspectives to the experience of all students and enhance our long tradition of having Bilgi students learn from one another. Students from abroad are also highly important in our internationalization mission. Bilgi plays a vital role in international capacity building through the education and training it offers international students. This is particularly significant for students from low- and middle-income countries. International students bring with them an international perspective helping Bilgi domestic students enjoy a stimulating multicultural academic environment. Peer-to-peer learning can be as instructive as traditional academic teaching. A diversity of ideas and experience fuels innovation. Bilgi is hosting almost 600 international students from 90+ countries all over the world.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate the performance of the Azerbaijani athletes at London 2012?<br></h4><p>We were extremely happy with our results at London 2012. We set records in several sports that we participated in, and we also had a large team, with 53 athletes. Our team won 10 medals, of which two were gold. On the one hand, it demonstrates that London 2012 can be considered as our best Olympic performance ever, while on the other hand, one in five of our athletes were able to come home with a medal. In terms of worldwide rankings, we were in 30th place; in Europe, we were 15th; and of Islamic countries, we were third.</p><h4>What efforts does the NOC make to promote sports among Azerbaijani youth?</h4><p>Azerbaijan's NOC is considered as a signatory of the Olympic Charter of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). The main aim and goal of the NOC is to promote the participation of Azerbaijani athletes in Olympic Games. It is not under our obligation to prepare athletes for the games; however, this remains the obligation of the local sporting federations, clubs, and societies. Our obligations and goals are to provide participation in the international Olympic movement. We are the liaison between national athletes and the international arena. Moreover, the Azerbaijan NOC, in closer collaboration with each national sport federation, organizes awareness-raising campaigns and events in order to draw young people's attention to sports and by doing so to promote the importance of sports activities for a healthy lifestyle. Each national sport federation has their own sport development and promotion projects, which are planned either in the short-term or long-term perspective. As an umbrella organization, we usually support sport federations during their awareness-raising events in order to have the possibility to cover a broader audience.</p><h4>What do the European Olympic Games signify for Azerbaijan?</h4><p>At the very outset, let me proudly highlight that Azerbaijan is a country of “firsts." Our country is known for its firsts from the oil sector to art, from chemistry to culture. Azerbaijan prides itself on having created the first opera in the Middle East. Azerbaijan was the first Muslim country that granted women the right to vote. Hosting the first European Games will be marked as another “first" of ours in the field of sports. Therefore, we feel delighted by hosting the first-ever European Games in the capital city of Azerbaijan. Being the first city to host the European Olympic Games means a lot for us: it means a privilege; it means an opportunity; it means new challenges. On the other hand, it is worth mentioning that these will be the inaugural European Olympic Games. There have been Oceanic Games, Asian Games, and Pan-American Games, but this is the first time that the European Olympic Games will be held. Generally, in order to prepare for such a large-scale event, one needs a minimum of six or seven years, as is the case for the Olympic Games. However, we have just over two years. Considering the time schedule, we will consider the scope of work and work hard. In time, we will come up with a sporting program in coordination with the European Olympic Committee (EOC), as well as other international committees.</p><div class="quote">“We are the liaison between national athletes and the international arena."</div><h4>What further international sporting events are  being planned in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>In June 2013, the Islamic Solidarity Sports Federation will convene in Indonesia to announce who will host the 2017 Islamic Solidarity Games. We believe it will be Baku, as we are currently the sole host-candidate city and our candidacy was officially confirmed in October 2012 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, during the meeting of the Executive Board of the Islamic Solidarity Sports Federation. We have established a working group under the Baku 2017 Bid Committee comprising of professional local and international experts. The working group is responsible for the whole bidding process. It should be noted that in 2016 alone, Baku will host two tremendous events: the World Chess Cup and the UEFA U-17 European Championship Final Tournament.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[from-our-land]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the idea behind starting AZGRANATA, and what strategy has guided your expansion and diversification?</h4><p>The main idea was to launch a factory in the region that would support regional development, create new jobs, support local farmers, introduce modern agricultural growing technologies to Azerbaijan, decrease the country's reliance on imports, and promote pomegranate products globally. The guiding idea was natural consumer demand for quality products, regional development, and more investment in human resources that lead to expansion. In order to become competitive in the local market and also to eliminate the risks associated with reliance on one product, we aim to diversify our product portfolio.</p><h4>Does the Azerbaijani brand and export image impact your sales, and how is AZGRANATA striving to improve the “Made in Azerbaijan" trademark abroad?</h4><p>We have faced no constraints regarding the Azerbaijani brand or export image in foreign markets. Azerbaijan is famous for pomegranate and other fruit throughout the world. That has helped us to some extent when we sought to enter foreign markets. In order to improve the “Made in Azerbaijan" trademark, we produce and sell only the highest-quality products, participate at global trade fairs, and attend business forums abroad. We partner and cooperate with global and reputable companies exclusively in order to strengthen our operations and increase the trust of our consumers and customers. AZGRANATA always supports its clients in their regional markets in promotion of the “Made in Azerbaijan" trademark. Locally, we organize visits to our factory and introduce our production facilities and processes to our partners and final consumers.</p><h4>How would you describe the market for FMCGs in Azerbaijan, and how do you intend to place your products ahead of well-established multinational brands?</h4><p>The FMCG market in Azerbaijan is very competitive, as there are many local and foreign players at work. Currently, due to an increase in the population's income, demand for high-quality FMCG products is increasing and thus attracting new players and products to the market. We make our marketing plan decisions based on extensive research, so we are aware of consumer demand and try to offer a supply that matches it. We also differentiate our products in markets by price and the fact that they are sourced locally. AZGRANATA works to produce goods for several consumer segments that differ in taste and income level. However, we never compromise when it comes to quality. In addition, we position ourselves as producers of organic and natural products.</p><div class="quote">“We partner and cooperate with global and reputable companies exclusively in order to strengthen our operations."</div><h4>What is the penetration rate of your products in Azerbaijan, and what percentage of your products is exported?</h4><p>Despite only launching sales operations in September 2011, our local market penetration is almost 100% to date. It is possible to find our products at every sales point in Azerbaijan. We began exporting at the end of 2011 and the beginning of 2012. Since then, our exports have shown an increasing trend. Today, exports account for 10% of our general sales. In addition, our products are sold in the CIS, the US, the UAE, and more than 10 European countries including Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and the UK.</p><h4>How do you envisage the increasing awareness of your products in new markets?</h4><p>Pomegranate juice is very famous for its health benefits, and consumption rates are growing around the world. In order to match this growth, we will participate in exhibitions, continue searching for new markets, and support our clients abroad. Our pomegranate juices have been certified organic by the German Lacon GmbH institute, are kosher, and have ISO 22000:2005 accreditation. By continuously investing in promotion abroad, we aim to increase the awareness of our products and highlight the “Made in Azerbaijan" trademark.</p><h4>How would you rate Azerbaijan as a production base for consumer goods?</h4><p>Azerbaijan has a lot of perspectives due to its environmental and geographical location. Azerbaijani agriculture is growing and able to supply production companies with raw materials. Also, high literacy levels in Azerbaijan puts it ahead in finding skillful and knowledgeable human resources, which are extremely important to produce goods of high quality.</p><h4>What have been the most significant changes to the investment landscape for FMCG goods in Azerbaijan during the administration of President Aliyev?</h4><p>During the tenure of President Aliyev, a significant amount of new FMCG-manufacturing organizations were opened and restructured. The government launched many different support programs to establish local manufacturing organizations, increase local production, and encourage exports. The main purpose of supporting local manufacturers was to decrease external dependence on the FMCG market. Moreover, strengthening competition caused the consistent increase in the production of high-quality products, all of them affecting the consumers' well being. President Aliyev attended the opening ceremony of our factory, and the visit was very important to us. His vision is to increase exports and he encouraged us to focus on exports. Following such a vision, we are already exporting to close to 20 countries, and we are looking forward to increasing that number to 40 by the end of 2013.</p><h4>Looking forward to 2013, what are your growth objectives for AZGRANATA, and which markets are you targeting for future expansion?</h4><p>Our main focus will remain exports. We plan to invest in promoting our products abroad. We will embark on export enhancement by opening regional distribution centers in the CIS, Europe, the US, and the Middle East. Furthermore, we will support our clients in promoting our brands in their local markets. We also plan to diversify our product portfolio even more by introducing new products in 2013, such as compote, pomegranate syrup, and jam and pomegranate wine, which are unique to Azerbaijan. These products will also become a competitive advantage for the company.</p><h4>What is your medium-term outlook for AZGRANATA?</h4><p>We aim to increase our exports in the medium term. We will position ourselves as an organic product supplier throughout the accessible markets. In addition, we plan to expand in related agricultural sectors by investing in fruit gardens, developing best-practice growing systems, improving cold storage, and furthering our fruit processing activity.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the developments within Delta Group over the past year?</h4><p>High-quality control and the systematic monitoring of investment projects has led to the growth of Delta Group. In 2012, a committee headed by the Board of Directors was created. It is a regulating and administrative committee through which there is a management of business processes and the interaction between import, distribution, logistics, marketing, and production. Highly qualified specialists in the field of sales, logistics, finance, and management are involved.</p><h4>What is the progress on your Saglam Qida factory and what impact is this expected to have on production once it is opened?</h4><p>This plant is unique in Azerbaijan. The production process will meet all of the requirements of international quality standards. Bread and bakery products will meet hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP), which are hygienic quality standards. The main goal for us is to provide our customers with high-quality bakery products at affordable prices. At this stage, the plant's construction is complete. Currently, German experts are conducting adjustment work. The logistics system and marketing strategy is fully developed. The plant will open soon, and in the near future customers will be able to buy our bread at various outlets.</p><h4>How would you describe the market for FMCGs in Azerbaijan? How do you intend to place your products ahead of well-established multinational brands?</h4><p>Over the last few years, the FMCG sector has continuously developed and we have seen an expansion of market chains and an increase in local production. In addition, many worldwide brands have entered the Azerbaijani market. All of these factors have led to an expansion of Azerbaijani companies abroad, as they have been using their experience in the national market to widen the scope of their activities. I am very positive in terms of future expectations and I believe the sector will grow further in 2013 and beyond. In general, our work is uniquely designed to meet the needs of consumers. Products imported and manufactured by us are under investigation in the domestic market. This involves a variety of qualitative and quantitative research in the field of marketing. Due to the necessary experience in the field of marketing, we offer products in the market that fulfill the needs of our consumers. Even some of them, according to surveys conducted by independent local and foreign marketing companies, have become our customers' favorite products.</p><div class="quote">“In addition to the bread factory, we are planning projects in terms of agriculture and flour products."</div><h4>What is the penetration rate of your products in Azerbaijan? Where are your products exported?</h4><p>We conduct our operational activities in the territory of Baku and regions of Azerbaijan. At this time, we have covered all regions of Azerbaijan, including the territory of Nakhchivan. We have a major stake in the strategically important food sector. Also, we are the official representative of world-famous brands, both in Azerbaijan and in several other countries. Producing goods capable of competing on the world market, our aim is to present Azerbaijan to foreign countries. Our goods are present in countries such as Russia, Israel, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, Libya, and Iraq.</p><h4>How would you rate Azerbaijan as a production base for consumer goods?</h4><p>I firmly believe that Azerbaijan has huge potential and possesses all the resources to become a production base. Thanks to the successful policy of President Ilham Aliyev in the field of production, we see increases in output every year and the quality of consumer goods improves regularly.</p><h4>What have been the most significant changes to the investment landscape for FMCG goods in Azerbaijan during the past decade?</h4><p>The global and targeted work of the Aliyev administration in carrying out reforms in the economy, and in particular in the development of the FMCG of sector in Azerbaijan, was one significant change. According to strategic research, Azerbaijan is on track to become the most rapidly growing country by 2030. The scale of the population's total income is progressing and the average monthly income per capita is also growing in relation to previous years. During this past presidential administration, numerous enterprises for FMCG production have been created. In parallel, new foreign investors and world brands have presented a market of great opportunities in Azerbaijan. As a producer and importer, Delta Group completely supports the President and his administration.</p><h4>Looking forward to 2013, what are your growth objectives for Delta Group?</h4><p>Delta Group has always been a development-oriented company that has actively sought to join the ranks of nationwide projects. In addition to the bread factory, we are planning projects in terms of agriculture and flour products. We aim to expand our import portfolio and bring even more internationally recognized brands to Azerbaijan. By the end of 2013, we expect an increase in capacity, product assortment, and the construction of a regional logistics center, which will provide franchising services.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Azerbaijan hosted two major international events in 2012. How would you evaluate their success?</h4><p>According to feedback we received from the organizers of Eurovision 2012 and the U-17 FIFA Women's World Cup, the events were organized and implemented successfully and there were many positive opinions about the high standards we met. Team members, coaches, performers, and journalists from all over Europe and the world were impressed by the capability of Azerbaijan as a new destination that has the ability to facilitate and host major international events without any problems or major deficiencies. This success also helped us maintain a positive trend of tourist arrivals, as there were some worries on our side that tourist flows might decline in 2012 due to the global economic and financial crisis. Currently, Azerbaijan is still on a path to become a primary tourist destination for Europe, and these major events and many other important undertakings served to promote the country.</p><h4>What needs to be done in order to change Azerbaijan's image abroad and make it attractive for both winter and seaside tourism?</h4><p>For both segments of tourism, we need to work on the development and improvement of infrastructure. For this we are developing the Shahdag skiing resort to cover the winter tourism side, with the opening of the first two hotels planned in the near future. In the same area, we plan to develop a “tourist cluster" as we build up the seaside areas in the vicinity of Shahdag. Relevant high-scale plans are being developed and regulatory issues are also being resolved. We expect to make great progress in the development of the human potential in these areas, as it is not sufficient to conduct marketing alone—the level of service, entertainment, safety, and other aspects must be covered to reach appropriate levels of sustainability. We also have to identify and elaborate regulatory mechanisms for construction and land allocation.</p><h4>What initiatives is the Ministry undertaking in order to increase foreign investment in the hospitality sector?</h4><p>We established fruitful cooperation with AZPROMO, the Azerbaijan Investment and Export Promotion Agency. Together, we have developed and promoted several projects at various organized events. Moreover, we engaged in active negotiations with several potential investors who are interested in the local tourism market. We consistently discuss concrete projects, help investors understand the business and legislative environments, identify opportunities, and highlight potential challenges and proposed solutions for the sector. Within the national tourism strategy covering the period of the next 10 years, we will allocate more time and effort to the establishment of relevant links with international investment communities, which will encourage them to come to Azerbaijan. As a first step, we plan to take part in several tourism investment forums during 2013, mainly to present the investment potential of the local tourism industry. Furthermore, several provisions will be stipulated in the new Tourism Law to provide additional incentives for foreign investment.</p><div class="quote">“We promote our culture at more than 20 major international tourism fairs and exhibitions annually. "</div><h4>Azerbaijan has a very rich cultural heritage that is often unknown to those without connections to the country. What efforts are being made to promote Azerbaijani culture abroad?</h4><p>We stage many events such as cultural days in a number of countries every year. In addition, we promote our culture at more than 20 major international tourism fairs and exhibitions annually. There is also the Azerbaijani Cultural Center, which opened in Paris in September 2012 with support from the Heydar Aliyev Foundation. Our Ministry actively promotes Azerbaijani culture in the world's mass-media outlets, as well as by advertising Azerbaijan on CNN, euronews, and other international channels. Many international cultural events such as the International Theater Festival, the Gabala International Classical Music Festival, the Rostropovich Festival, and the Jazz Festival are being held in the country, complete with the participation of celebrities who seek to show their art and learn about local culture.</p><h4>What have been the most significant changes to the tourism sector in Azerbaijan under President Ilham Aliyev's administration?</h4><p>The major changes seen in the tourism industry are thanks to Ilham Aliyev's administration. The Ministry of Culture and Tourism in its current shape was established by presidential decree. It was President Aliyev's administration that identified tourism as one of three non-oil sectors that have priority and must be supported by the government in line with its economic development policies. In addition to agriculture and telecommunications, tourism enjoys the status of a priority industry. As a result, two state programs were approved for the development of tourism, one of which has already been successfully completed. Since tourism is more than simply hotels and travel companies, there was invaluable support from the leadership of the country in terms of the development of relevant infrastructure such as roads and transportation networks. We also worked in partnership to attract private investment, promote Azerbaijan as a tourism destination, implement various projects, and host international events. Another example of the President's tremendous support was that 2011 was declared the “Year of Tourism," with many events and activities planned to support the national tourism sector.</p><h4>What are the Ministry's medium-term plans beyond the 2013 presidential election?</h4><p>The tourism industry is operating in a period of rethinking, and we are currently evaluating the path we have completed, as well as the shortages and deficiencies of the organization. We are identifying our future priorities and action plans, potential, and perspectives. There are some strategic events that will take place within this medium-term period including, but not limited to, the development of a new Tourism Law, the preparation of a 10-year Tourism Strategy, a major international project toward the improvement of the technical capabilities of the Department of Tourism, and the inauguration of hotels within the Shahdag skiing resort. Furthermore, the resolution of major issues regarding tourism and recreation zones in cooperation with other state agencies and the staging of a number of key events are on the agenda.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate the success of the 2012 Year of Sports?</h4><p>With the decree of Ilham Aliyev, the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan, 2012 was declared the “Year of Sports." In the true sense of the phrase, 2012 really was a year for sport. The achievements of our athletes and the organization of international competitions in our country, as well as the strengthening of material and technical resources, made it a good year for sport in Azerbaijan. Undoubtedly, the greatest success was at the London Olympics. Azerbaijan scored its best medal haul in its Olympic history at the London 2012 games and was also among the top-ranking Muslim countries. Our Olympians won two gold, two silver, and six bronze medals, making the total a record for the country. Azerbaijan was 15th among European countries, third place among Muslim countries, and fifth place in the CIS. In terms of the Turkic states, Azerbaijan ranked second. For the first time, Azerbaijan was represented in six sports with 21 athletes. Azerbaijani Paralympians also won a historic victory at the Paralympic Games. Our team, competing for the first time, won four gold, five silver, and three bronze medals. The team finished 27th among 166 countries and 12th among European countries. There were many individual achievements at the games, including Rovshan Bayramov, who won a silver medal, and Xetaq Qazyumov, who won a bronze medal, thus repeating their results at the Beijing Olympics. Maria Stadnik won a silver medal after much improvement. And Ilham Zakiyev became the owner of a triple Paralympic medal. For the first time in the history of Azerbaijani sports at the London Paralympic Games, our athlete Natali Pronina won one gold and four silver medals in swimming, and with a total of five medals, she made history. Togrul Asgarov won a gold medal at the age of 19 and entered the history books of Azerbaijani sports as the youngest Olympic champion.</p><h4>Azerbaijan also recently hosted its largest sporting event ever, the FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup. How successful was the event and how has that paved the way for Azerbaijan to host future international sporting events?</h4><p>Throughout 2012, Azerbaijan hosted several events. One of these events was the FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup, held between September 22 and October 13 in Baku and Lankaran. Every year the number of international competitions organized in our country increases. In the coming years, the number and quality of the competitions will improve. We are now looking forward to host the 2015 Chess Olympiad and the 2015 World Chess Cup in Baku. In addition, Baku will host the inaugural European Games in 2015 and the 4th Islamic Solidarity Games in 2017.</p><h4>A lot of money has been invested in sporting infrastructure projects in regions outside of Baku. What is the philosophy behind the investments?</h4><p>Over the past 10 years, 35 Olympic sport complexes have been built. They provide a great opportunity for the development of sports in each region. As a result, our youth is growing up healthy and strong and a new generation of athletes is emerging. At the same time, the opening of such complexes in the regions means athletes have the ability to compete at various levels as the country is able to hold more and more events. Currently, a gymnastics complex is under construction in Baku that will allow us to hold various international competitions. We also have the Republic Sport Medical Center, which will provide athletes with all medical services. The construction of the Water Sport Palace has begun in Baku. The creation of sports centers plays an important role in the strengthening of the material-technical base of sports as a whole. In recent years, special attention has also been given to the construction of swimming pools and chess schools. For example, in 2012 several chess schools opened in the regions and began to operate. The Tofiq Bahramov Stadium has also been redeveloped and is now able to host various outdoor sporting events.</p><div class="quote">“Every year the number of international competitions organized in our country increases."</div><h4>With the 2013 Presidential elections coming up, what issues do you think are most important to the electorate?</h4><p>Young people are the focus of a special government program, and despite the fact that the program was only adopted 16 months ago, a large number of challenges have been overcome. In December 2011, a Youth foundation under the Ministry of Youth and Sports was established by presidential decree. The Foundation began its activities in accordance with modern requirements and using progressive international experience in this field; it is the first organization in the country to conduct all of its activities over the internet. For the first time in Azerbaijan, the Youth Foundation accepts and supports individual applications. In order to support the development of young people, especially in the regions, the network of social service institutions also continues to expand. Currently, there are 15 such centers, and the construction of 15 more have begun. A package of legislative proposals have been prepared in order to protect the interests of young people, such as for housing, employment, support for talented people, and education. The population is over 9 million, of which 31% is in the youth category. Nearly half of the electorate are young people. Opinion polls show that our young people trust and believe in the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan. They believe in the innovative spirit and fair leadership of the President supporting young people, and in turn they take an active participation in the implementation of policies accepted by the President. Azerbaijan's youth highly appreciates stability and favorable conditions for the development of society and the economy. The Azerbaijani youth support the policies of President Ilham Aliyev. This fact was also confirmed during the last elections. Athletes and young people feel the special care of the state. I believe that they will vote for the continuation of this development direction.</p><h4>What is the long-term plan of the Ministry in order to ensure the promotion of sports?</h4><p>At present, we are implementing state programs for the development of football and chess for the upcoming years. This process will continue in the future. In addition, similar programs will be implemented for various kinds of sports. The modernization and expansion of sporting infrastructure will continue into the future. We also aim to create bilateral relations with other countries in order to develop sports programs.</p><h4>Baku has been chosen to host the first ever European Olympic Games in 2015. How are you preparing for this?</h4><p>The idea to organize the first European Olympic Games 2015 in Baku and the following decision of the European Olympic Committee created excitement among the Azerbaijani people. We are honored to hold the first ever European Olympic Games in Baku. With the decision, which was made in Rome on December 8, 2012 at the General Assembly of the European Olympic Committee, Europe has entrusted Azerbaijan with hosting such an important event. As you know, the first step in any job always demands much more responsibility. In this way, we are doing our best to organize the games at the highest level, so we will be able to justify the confidence of the people who voted for the candidacy of Baku, and amaze the sporting community with our organizational experience.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of SINAM in Azerbaijan and your personal role in the company?<br></h4><p>From the very start, we focused on innovative approaches to ICT implementation, and this has set us apart from our competitors. Almost 18 years later, SINAM remains one of the largest providers of integrated ICT solutions in the South Caucasus and Central Asia region. The company has affiliates in the UAE, Russia, Kyrgyzstan, and Georgia. We are active in the Southern Caucasus, Central Asia, and the Middle East. Our value proposition spans the entire value chain, from hardware implementation and software design to consulting services.</p><h4>Could you list some of the projects that SINAM has been part of?</h4><p>Over the years, SINAM has succeeded in the implementation of many large projects, especially in the area of e-government in Azerbaijan. In terms of the absolute number of individuals who have been using technologies introduced by SINAM within the government sector of this country, it is equivalent to more than 7.5 million users. Our solutions are used by the entire population of the country, and this makes us very proud. Also, our solutions directly or indirectly affect some 60% of companies conducting business in Azerbaijan. SINAM has implemented several dozens of projects in various government institutions, including the State Border Patrol Service, the State Social Protection Fund, the Central Bank, the Ministry of Communication and Information Technologies, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Education, to name a few. The most important projects include the introduction of banking service solutions for the national postal service, AzerPost. This solution was a pioneer project within the CIS. SINAM was a member of a consortium of global market leaders implementing this project. The excellence of the solution attracted the attention of other governments, and currently the consortium is about to implement similar solutions for the postal services of Ukraine and Moldova. SINAM is always on the lookout for the latest trends in IT in order to implement them in its solutions. Part of our business strategy includes the development of cloud-based services. The global trends in computer technology in the next few years will be in cloud-based solutions, and SINAM has made the transition to this strategy several years ago. I believe that in 2013-2014, most of the IT providers and services around the world will make a transition to cloud-based solutions. SINAM is also actively involved in penetrating international markets with its e-government solutions. We are actively working in Kyrgyzstan on projects for taxation services and land survey agencies in the country. We are most interested in countries that are actively implementing e-government solutions.</p><h4>How does SINAM manage to source IT specialists in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Our company is in constant collaboration with universities and colleges that train IT specialists in the country. Students are invited for internships at our company, and the most successful students receive contracts to work in our company and grow professionally. We have close ties with Baku State University, the State Technical University, and Qafqaz University, which are the main sources of IT specialists for SINAM. Graduates from these types of schools should be creative, innovative, and capable of solving multiple problems.</p><h4>How would you assess the importance of e-government solutions for Azerbaijan?</h4><p>The efficiency of any government is based on the quality of services it provides for its citizens. The only way to provide these quality government services is through e-government. The development of e-government technology and ICT is given special attention in Azerbaijan because the government's strategy is based on building effective and transparent relationships between the state and its citizens. The projects implemented by SINAM in Azerbaijan help enable this strategy, and we are proud that we are part of this process. At the same time, I argue that Azerbaijan needs to increase funding to build its electronic government. This will help to improve the quality of services, build the required foundations, and catch up with global e-government leaders. For example, Singapore has developed a program to introduce an electronic government scheme during 2010-2015 at a total cost of $2 billion. In Azerbaijan, the total budget for the same types of services is only $200 million. This is not sufficient if our country wants to become more efficient. I am sure that in the next few years, Azerbaijan will be spending more on the development and the introduction of e-government technology.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Having served as Minster of Transport for 10 years, what would you say some of your major accomplishments have been?<br></h4><p>In recent years, the activities of the transport sector have been focused on a major overhaul of the entire transport infrastructure, the complete satisfaction of the population, the economic need for transport services, and the effective organization of business with the aid of ongoing reform. These goals have always been in the spotlight of the Ministry of Transport. Specific measures have been taken to accurately fulfill the tasks laid down in various state programs. Over the last 10 years, the volume of permanent investment in road transport infrastructure has reached AZN7.4 billion. The average annual growth in freight traffic is 8.18%, and 5.54% in passenger traffic. A total of 1.6 billion tons of cargo and 11.4 billion passengers have been transported. The average annual growth rates in the turnover of cargo and passenger transportation has been 17.36% and 6.9%, respectively. The volume of cargo in the Europe-Caucasus-Asia international transport corridor was 465.4 million tons, registering an average annual growth of 5.12%. The volume of transit transportation in said corridor is 145.8 million tons. Due to the transition of Azerbaijan to a market economy, the transport sector has undergone institutional reform, and the transport infrastructure and management institutions have been significantly modernized and upgraded. In order to ensure the effective management and regulation of the road transport sector in the conditions of new economic relations, “The Single Transport Policy Concept of the Republic of Azerbaijan," “The Strategy on the Development of a Transport System in the Republic of Azerbaijan," and “The Transit Strategy of the Republic of Azerbaijan" have been developed to facilitate integration into the international system of transport and contribute to the overall development of the country's transport infrastructure. In order to facilitate its integration into the international system of transport, eight laws have been adopted, 16 presidential decrees signed, 79 decisions and resolutions of the Cabinet of Ministers issued, 106 bilateral and multilateral agreements on cooperation in the field of transport concluded with a number of countries, and 27 memorandums signed. In addition, the Republic has joined 15 agreements and conventions of the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE).</p><h4>What is the country's policy for opening up more international air links for regional cities in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>A total of AZN956.3 million has been invested in the development of the aviation sector and the renewal of the air fleet. Over the past several years, four Airbus-319s, four Boeing-757s, one Boeing-727, one Boeing-747, two ATR planes, and six helicopters have been purchased. In addition, a modern Baku Cargo Terminal with logistical management meeting modern requirements has been commissioned. An international airport has been built in Gabala, while international airports in Nakhchivan, Ganja, Zaqatala, and Lankaran have been renovated. Work is currently underway on the construction of a new terminal, runway, and four hangars at the Heydar Aliyev International Airport. In order for the aviation infrastructure to further enhance the transit potential of the region and to develop the country's tourism industry, a process has been started to upgrade the national air fleet. Plans have also been put in place to declare the country's international airports free economic zones.</p><h4>With regards to the imminent completion of the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars (BTK) railway, what impact does the Ministry hope to see from increased regional integration?</h4><p>The joint venture of the BTK railway project by Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey has begun and is currently in full swing. The construction of a 101-kilometer section required to connect the Trans-Europe and Trans-Asia railway networks to the South Caucasus railway system will enable cargo and passenger transportation from China through Central Asia and from the South Caucasus to the EU. The full operational capacity of the transport corridors passing through Azerbaijan will necessitate joining the convention concerning international carriage by rail and becoming a member of its intergovernmental organization. As a link enhancing the importance of the Transport Corridor Europe-Caucasus-Asia (TRACECA), the BTK railway project will also expand the transit potential of regional countries, accelerate the process of integration into the EU, facilitate cooperation within the framework of the European Neighborhood policy, and contribute to the development of Azerbaijan's foreign economic relations.</p><div class="quote">“In order to improve the quality of the taxi service in Baku, 543 London taxis and other cabs have been purchased."</div><h4>What is being done to improve the quality and efficiency of public transport, both in Baku and in the provinces?</h4><p>In order to improve the quality of public transport, an international bus terminal meeting modern standards has been built in Baku. New bus stations have been built in 14 district centers. Existing bus stations have been renovated and commissioned in seven other district centers. A total of 2,720 large- and medium-sized modern passenger buses have been brought to Azerbaijan in the last five years in an effort to improve the quality of inter-city, intra-urban, and international passenger transport, ensuring safety and reducing traffic congestion. A total of 400 out of 750 transport vehicles for inter-city bus services, 2,100 out of 3,000 vehicles for intra-urban services in Baku, 20 out of 90 transport vehicles for inter-city bus services, 100 out of 400 transport vehicles for intra-urban services in Ganja, 20 out of 90 transport vehicles for inter-city bus services, and 80 out of 650 vehicles required for intra-urban services in Sumgait have been replaced. In order to improve the quality of the taxi service in Baku, 543 London taxis and other cabs have been purchased. The number of London taxis is expected to increase to 3,000. A total of 65 taxi stands have been established throughout the capital. Measures have also been taken to improve the quality of the bus service in Baku, such as the establishment of 617 new bus stops. An intelligent transport management center has been built and commissioned in the city of Baku.</p><h4>What challenges does Azerbaijan face in becoming a regional transport hub, and how is the Ministry addressing these?</h4><p>The fact that the TRACECA and North-South international transport corridors converge on Azerbaijan has led to the emergence of an important transport hub in Eurasia and has required the creation of necessary transport infrastructure. Some of the most important infrastructure projects we have undertaken include the reconstruction of a highway and a railway line from Baku to the Georgian border on the basis of the latest technology in order to accelerate the speed of traffic and improve road safety, the construction of a new international seaport and creation of an international logistical center in the Alat settlement where both corridors converge, the purchase of new ferries with a capacity of 52 railway carriages in order to eliminate any physical barriers, the simplification of border clearance procedures through the introduction of a “one-window" principle, and the commissioning of six international airports throughout the country.</p><h4>More than $140 million of the state budget has been allocated to the Ministry for 2013. What are some of the main projects that will be funded by this?</h4><p>In general, the funds allocated from the state budget and other specific funds finance the construction and maintenance of motor roads, junctions, tunnels, pedestrian subways and other facilities, the implementation of various road transport projects including maintenance and repair, and the reconstruction of roads that are on the Ministry's balance sheet. Large-scale projects are mainly implemented with loans and financial support from international financial institutions.</p><h4>What is the long-term vision of the Ministry?</h4><p>The proposals on future development directions with a view to resolving some of the outstanding problems with the organization of passenger and cargo transport and ensuring better coordination among various transport agencies in international transportation are as follows: to establish educational institutions to train qualified drivers in line with international standards; supply institutions with the necessary equipment and develop modern training programs; to optimize the bus service within district areas and between villages; and to continue work on the construction of new bus stations and the reconstruction of existing ones. In order to eliminate traffic congestion in the main cities of the Republic (Baku, Ganja, and Sumgait), we need to identify areas suitable for car parks at the entrance to the cities and elsewhere, to expand radial streets and avenues and build new radial roads in the newly reconstructed parts of the city, to introduce a light high-speed railway service, to apply new technology in order to ensure the transparent operation of the transport sector, to build alternative high-speed and fee-based roads along the North-South and East-West international transport corridors, to build a new highway linking Guba and Shamakhi districts, and to continue work on replacing the sand and gravel roads in the Republic with asphalt-concrete roads.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your plans to increase the route network to incorporate long-haul destinations?</h4><p>We have a contract with the Brazilian company Embraer for the supply of six medium-haul jets, which will join the AZAL fleet in 2013. We also signed an agreement with Airbus for the supply of two long-haul Airbus A340 aircraft, the first of which arrived in Baku in January 2013. We have decided to set our sights on markets in Southeast Asia and North America. We have recently held talks with the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), which resulted in AZAL receiving the right to perform flights to Beijing. At the same time, we are actively preparing for audits by the relevant regulatory authorities in the field of civil aviation in order to obtain permits to operate flights to New York. In parallel to this, we plan to open flights to a number of new destinations in Russia, the CIS, and beyond.</p><h4>How has AZAL reacted in light of increased competition from European carriers, such as British Airways, Turkish Airlines, and Lufthansa?</h4><p>We firmly believe that there can be no development without competition. Although said airlines have extensive experience in international air travel and Azerbaijan's civil aviation department is still very young, AZAL already complies with the highest standards of safety and quality of service and is not afraid of competition. This is a normal process if we take into consideration the ever-growing international authority and economic attractiveness of our country, as well as the rapidly blooming city of Baku. In essence, Azerbaijan's aviation industry faced the same choice as Singapore in the early 1970s—to take the path of protectionism or to open its air gates to all interested foreign carriers. The choice was made in favor of the latter. Today, AZAL has strong competition from globally recognized brands from almost all directions. On the Baku-Moscow route alone there are six carriers with up to 10 flights per day. Passengers don't have an obligation to fly with us, and the airline understands that. Such competition makes us stronger, and this largely explains AZAL's compliance with international requirements and standards. In 2012, our flight attendants and pilots received a new elegant uniform designed in bright colors with positive elements of national ornamentation. Passengers like the new outfit, and we have received hundreds of positive reviews.</p><h4>How would you describe the evolution of Azerbaijan's aviation sector over the past decade?</h4><p>It is rather difficult to embrace such a massive topic in an interview format. In the past 10 years under Ilham Aliyev's presidency, Azerbaijan's civil aviation has come a long way. These have been years of successful projects and impressive achievements. The replenishment of the aircraft and helicopter fleet with modern Western aircraft, the growing passenger and cargo traffic, the opening of new lines, the construction of new airports and a cargo terminal, and the opening of a modern flight training center are just a few of the positive changes that have occurred in the industry since 2003. We are optimistic for the future, knowing what a huge responsibility lies on Azerbaijan's aviators. After all, one of our main goals is to maintain the course, pace, and dynamics laid down by the President over the past 10 years.</p><div class="quote">“One of our main goals is to maintain the course, pace, and dynamics laid down by the President over the past 10 years."</div><h4>What investment opportunities exist in Azerbaijan's aviation sector?</h4><p>The civil aviation sector of Azerbaijan is open to investment. A bright and fresh example of this is the new crew-training center of the National Aviation Academy of Azerbaijan. It is a joint venture with Boeing, which is a full member and investor in the project. It also shares all the financial risks with AZAL. Launched only recently in 2010, the project has proved very successful. It has already become a key institution in the region providing training to crews from Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Georgia, and many more countries. In May 2012, an agreement was signed on awarding the National Aviation Academy of Azerbaijan the status of an International Air Transport Association (IATA) Training Center for the “Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Air."</p>]]></richbody0content>

Some of the more prestigious projects we have worked on are Flame Towers, the Heydar Aliyev Cultural Center, and the Shahdag Summer-Winter Tourism Complex Project. The Flame Towers project is located on the Caspian Sea in Azerbaijan. The site is situated on a hill overlooking Baku Bay, the old city center, and a park. With a site area of approximately 28,000 sqm, the project consists of three main buildings—office, hotel, and residence towers—and a mall that links them. The total built-up area (BUA) of the project is approximately 245,000 sqm. The concept belongs to HOK, and DIA Holding designed the details of the project. The Heydar Aliyev Cultural Center will provide the city with a major new venue and landmark. Dedicated to the founding President of Azerbaijan, the center will house a conference hall, an auditorium, a library, a museum, and food and beverage areas. The site will take up just over 100,000 sqm. The concept was designed by Zaha Hadid. The Tourism Complex in Shahdag will be developed in several stages and accommodate up to 10,000 visitors in various hotels when completed. In addition, a comprehensive tourism program will be developed for the visitors, engaging in both summer and winter activities.</p><h4>What projects are you involved in abroad?</h4><p>DIA Holding has been awarded as the general contractor of the Bilkent Integrated Health Campus Project, located in Ankara, Turkey. The project consists of a health campus with a total capacity of 3,662 beds and will serve Ankara, as well as nearby cities. The campus will have 1,350 doctors, 2,750 nurses, and 2,580 assistant personnel with a total capacity of 20,000 patients per day. DIA Holding has a contract to be a service provider for the health campus for 25 years. The whole project is valued at ‚¬1.1 billion, and will be financed through public-private partnerships (PPPs) with various international financial institutions.</p><h4>How would you describe the investment climate within the Azerbaijani construction sector?</h4><p>Azerbaijan is a rapidly developing country, and the future potential in the construction sector is huge. Economic resources pave the way for further development in Azerbaijan, and the human capital potential here makes the country an attractive investment location.</p><h4>What changes have you seen in the economic development of Azerbaijan during Ilham Aliyev's tenure over the past decade?</h4><p>The economic development of Azerbaijan is far from negligible, and countries around the world have recognized the importance of the country in the region. Considering the economic growth over past 10 years, there are many reasons for being optimistic about the future of Azerbaijan. There are several enormous construction projects in Baku that have already taken a significant place in the region. Baku has a more significant standing than nearby cities on account of its cultural background, climate, and historical value.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the core strategies that have guided the development of ANT Group over the years, and how has the company positioned itself within the construction sector?</h4><p>We've been involved in both state- and private-sector projects over the last few years. This has included a few major projects with the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Justice. We are also working on the Bus Terminal project and another project in which we are constructing three-story buildings in the “20 Yanvar" district. We strive to ensure all of our projects are aesthetically pleasing. Whilst our work is mainly concentrated in Azerbaijan, we also have a small number of projects in Russia.</p><h4>How does working on state projects differ from private sector projects?</h4><p>On public projects, the costs, expenses, and budget are set by the state, whereas private sector projects are all dependent on market prices, making them more uncertain. We like to make sure we balance our project portfolio so we don't just focus on one customer base.</p><h4>What growth opportunities are there in Azerbaijan's construction sector?</h4><p>There is a lot of potential and opportunity for growth here, be it in terms of residential construction, tourism infrastructure, or public buildings.</p><div class="quote">“There is a lot of potential and opportunity for growth here, be it in terms of residential construction, tourism infrastructure, or public buildings."</div><h4>What challenges are there?</h4><p>The main challenge facing our sector in Azerbaijan is the lack of human capital. Whereas most countries these days have an unemployment problem, we tend to find that we have an inherent lack of skilled workers.</p><h4>How has Azerbaijan evolved over the past decade during President Aliyev's tenure?</h4><p>Since independence, the Azerbaijani economy has been improving very rapidly. This is due to strong profits from the oil industry, as well as the smart leadership and economic policies of our government.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the construction sector in the coming years?</h4><p>Azerbaijan offers many opportunities. I feel that the construction sector will continue to grow in the coming years, and we are very happy to be a part of this growth.</p><h4>What are your medium-term plans?</h4><p>We want to enlarge our construction business, as well as our production of construction materials, furniture, and concrete.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-better-footprint]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your overview of the ICT sector in its current state?</h4><p>Qatar's vision for 2030 has four pillars. One of those pillars is economic development and to have a knowledge-based economy. The goal is now to diversify away from the oil and gas sector to other industries. This is driven by the vision of His Highness the Emir. If you look back to the early 2000s, the main driver of the Qatari economy was oil and gas. Today, Qatar is investing heavily to diversify its economy. The ICT sector is led by ictQATAR as the regulator, and it has established different operators to enable the ICT sector and to promote its agenda, which in the end will meet the Qatar National Vision 2030. The country's ICT sector is mainly comprised of Qatar Satellite (Es'hailSat), Qatar National Broadband, as well as the telecoms operators. Five years ago, there was only one operator, but today there are several, which is a testament to Qatar's desire to open the market and promote the diversification of the economy. Diversification is a very important point, and it needs to be considered seriously because oil and gas are finite raw materials, and every country needs to have a backup plan to have resources and run the economy. In Qatar, we have the ICT sector and the sports sectors, which today is not only about the World Cup but also investments. We also have the tourism sector, which has projects and investment diversification opportunities.</p><h4>How do these plans synergize with the Qatar National Vision?</h4><p>People are the main assets. If we are investing in our staff, that means we are investing in assets. Our team of Qatari engineers will definitely contribute to the company, which will contribute to the ICT sector, which will contribute to the overall Qatari vision; it is all interrelated. Humans are the main resource and we cannot ignore them. That is why we are investing in our team. Indirectly, they will complement our vision and they will complement the Qatari 2030 vision.</p><div class="quote">“People are the main assets. If we are investing in our staff, that means we are investing in assets."</div><h4>What does Es'hailSat's target market consist of, and what do you plan to offer these clients?</h4><p>Es'hailSat was established in 2010 to serve the strategic and commercial objective of the state of Qatar. This country has many broadcasters, the most well-known being Al Jazeera. In 2010, when Al Jazeera won the broadcasting rights for FIFA 2010 in South Africa, it suffered from severe interference from signal jamming. Es'hailSat's strategic objective is to help the local and national broadcasters maintain the continuity of their broadcasts without interference. The commercial objectives will be formed once the strategic objectives have been fulfilled. Our customers will be mainly broadcasters, not only in Qatar but also around the region. Our primary services are broadcasting and telecoms.</p><h4>What are the characteristics of the satellite?</h4><p>The satellite will have four main purposes: to provide continuity of service and wide coverage for broadcasters, serve as a government aid, provide trunking and telecommunications, and develop the use of the KU and KA bandwidths for advanced communications services. The satellite is now being built in Palo Alto, California. It is scheduled to be launched in August 2013 by an Ariane rocket from French Guiana.</p><h4>What is your competitive advantage in the MENA region?</h4><p>Our satellite will be in one of the hotspots. In MENA, we have two hotspots: 7 west and 25.5 east. Today, 7 west is owned by Eutelsat and NileSat, the Egyptian operator. The majority of 25.5 east is owned by Arabsat and part of it by Eutelsat. When we decided to build and launch a satellite, we decided to be in a hotspot. This is why we entered a deal with Eutelsat to lease their frequency at 25.5 east. We will have fair commercial competition and the quality of service should be the factor as to who gets selected. This will be the differentiating factor.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Qatar's ICT sector as a whole?</h4><p>The sector is growing; that is undeniable. By having the new projects that Qatar has, such as the rail system, it is not only infrastructure and construction, but many industries that are involved. In my view, the ICT sector is growing daily, as is the demand. Technology is evolving. If you survive and cope with the changes in the sector and provide the best services for your shareholders, you have done the right thing. I used to work at ictQatar. In 2004, it had about 40 staff; today, it has about 300 employees. ictQatar is engaged in health, education, and security.</p><h4>What are your plans in the run up to the launch?</h4><p>We recently built a Capacity Management Center. This center will monitor our satellite quality, the signal strength, and help our team interface with customers to see if there are any problems. Our plan from today to the launch is to have the center up and running at 100%. In addition, we had four engineers in Palo Alto, where they received an intensive training program especially tailored for our team. We are also finishing the process of recruiting some more key people in the company.</p><h4>What does the launching of a Qatar-developed satellite mean for the country on the world stage?</h4><p>I am very proud of this, and I am sure that other Qataris are proud as well. We just came from the Cable &amp; Satellite exhibition in Dubai and that was our first participation in such a show. The following day, on Twitter, people started commenting about Es'hailSat, especially Qataris. People are expecting the best. This has put us under pressure. For Qatar it will bring another era to the ICT sector. Also, His Highness the Emir made an opening speech at a conference in 2012 mentioning Es'hailSat. He focused on Es'hailSat, which means a lot to us. It is a source of pride. Qataris are eagerly waiting for the launch and they are expecting the best.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What sort of steps is Al Hilal taking to safeguard against future external shocks?</h4><p>There are some things that are specific to Al Hilal, and other precautions that are banking-sector specific and are being carried out by the regulators. As far as Al Hilal is concerned, we follow the Central Bank's actions and focus further on our risk management and geographic exposure. We are lucky in the sense that Al Hilal is a new bank that didn't have much exposure globally. We started in June 2008, just on the heels of the crisis. That gave us an advantage as we weren't exposed to the wrong sectors or issues in certain geographies. We have more experience with certain ailing industries in the UAE or the region, and that gives us an advantage. We are one of the cleanest banks in the region, not just because we are very intelligent, but because time is on our side.</p><h4>How do you adapt your business strategy during difficult times?</h4><p>We identified the root of the issues and signals and readjusted our strategy and priorities. We often go back to basics and focus on very clear economic sectors that we forecast will not be as affected. During recent times, we paid close attention to the local line of business. Looking at our balance sheet, there is much local exposure. Everything is very Abu Dhabi based and sector-specific, and these operations were not affected by the economic turbulence that we were facing. That was by design.</p><div class="quote">“We foresee sustained growth for Islamic banking, with expectations that the segment will outgrow conventional banking."</div><h4>How would you evaluate the performance of your branches in Kazakhstan over the last year?</h4><p>There is a strong relationship between Abu Dhabi and Kazakhstan, and we forecasted that this partnership would yield further investment and trade between the two countries. This is one of the reasons we are following this investment and trade opportunity, which will continue to happen. Kazakhstan also has a large Muslim population, and we entered the market after the first Islamic banking license was issued. The country's location is very central to the CIS region, and it could be considered a stepping-stone for the whole region. Because we didn't know much about Kazakhstan, our strategy was very conservative and focused on infrastructure and government at first. We have done well in Kazakhstan, despite the fact that the crisis was also hitting that country. The banking sector was ailing and it faced many problems. We opened our Kazakhstan branch a year after we opened Al Hilal, in 2009.</p><h4>Are you cautious of a bubble bursting in the sukuk market?</h4><p>Not really. There are many elements that protect the sukuk market. First is the fact that it is nascent, small, and has yet to grow. Islamic finance has outgrown conventional banking in the last few years, even during the crisis, when the yearly growth of Islamic finance was almost more than 20% regionally and globally. That is not a bubble. Until there is a more rewarding opportunity or better yielding instruments for investors, the sukuk market will be there. There is growth in sukuk, and we see many corporates interested in the market. Specifically, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum has a vision of Dubai becoming an Islamic center and a major sukuk player. The whole Islamic finance market globally is worth around $1.2 trillion, so it is still minute compared to global assets and banking assets in the region, as well as compared to the growth and expenditures that our local economies are witnessing.</p><h4>How else does the bank seek to increase its profile in the finance industry?</h4><p>For Al Hilal Bank, being green is very important to our plan because Abu Dhabi is following the same trend. We are a bank that supports the realization of the 2030 Vision of Abu Dhabi, and being green is a cornerstone of that plan. Considering our strategy, our operations are focused on three pillars. One is the financial pillar. Second is the health of the bank. Third is our responsibility toward the development of the UAE and Abu Dhabi and their citizens. For example, there are a few achievements I am very proud of, one of which is the newly signed agreement we made with Emirates National School, a major education provider here in Abu Dhabi. We have created a banking curriculum that will be for school-aged children from kindergarten until graduation. We are not only financing the realization of the bridges and the various industrial sectors in the country, but we are also helping to shape the new generation for 2030.</p><h4>What is Al Hilal Bank doing to increase the number of nationals working in the banking sector?</h4><p>Currently, 31% of our employees are nationals, and we have one of the highest percentages of local staff among the banks. All of our branch managers are nationals. Since day one, this has been our policy design, and we are working to operate more unconventionally. The classic answer is that we train and hire nationals, which is what we do, but we also go beyond that. We have a program called Project 2020, in which everyone in the first line of management at Al Hilal should be a UAE national. This will be carried out through a very comprehensive program of development, and we do not expect it to take one month or one year. Instead, it will take us five or six years to shape the employees to become the new leaders. If I am to be remembered by this bank, aside from the financial side, I would like people to remember that I led the bank to graduate the best nationals in the union at the UAE level.</p><h4>Al Hilal won Best Regional Bank in the Middle East in 2012. How does the bank plan to sustain this achievement?</h4><p>We won because we are different and the bank has proven that there is value in its brand. The name of Al Hilal is large and well respected across various segments. We will sustain this by continuing our strategy and improving it where possible. Today, we are focused on designing Al Hilal 2.0, which will provide solutions and redefine banking. We hope this vision gives us an advantage over the competition as we face a new age in banking. The advantage for Al Hilal is that it is still small, and we can adapt easily, change, and improve much faster than the competition.</p><h4>What is your forecast for Islamic banking in the UAE for 2013?</h4><p>We foresee sustained growth for Islamic banking, with expectations that the segment will outgrow conventional banking. However, I believe we still have a long way to go. Islamic banking regionally, locally, and globally is being sought after, and people want to do banking with Islamic institutions. If we break the market into three segments, there is one segment that wants to do Islamic banking irrespective of how good or bad the banks are, another segment that would prefer to do Islamic banking if the product and the level of service are competitive, and a third segment that is indifferent—its customers go where the best service or product is. Islamic banks today have the opportunity to tap into the whole market, whereas conventional banks have only two out of the three. With the comprehensiveness of their product, good service, technology, and service they provide, Islamic banks have increased potential, and Al Hilal is an example of one such company. Any Muslim that prefers to do Islamic banking has every reason to choose Al Hilal. The bank has all of the products that conventional banks have, but it is also fresh, modern, young, and energetic. In addition, the bank is quickly evolving into its vision for the future.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What led to such a fantastic 2012?</h4><p>There are a number of factors that made 2012 such a successful year for Volkswagen. For example, we launched a number of products tailor-made to the needs and wants of our Middle East customers, including the Passat and the Polo Sedans. When you look at the market in the Middle East or Dubai, it is very similar to the US market, with the biggest segments being SUVs and sedans. Volkswagen provides German engineering at a price that fits the Middle East. Another factor is our investment in new and existing facilities and our continuing focus on service excellence. We opened new facilities in 2012 and we are currently planning the opening of new state-of-the-art service centers and showrooms in key markets later in 2013.</p><h4>Out of all the models here in Dubai, which ones are poised for the most growth in the coming months?</h4><p>We have two product sectors that we believe have the strongest growth potential: sedans and SUVs. In terms of sedans, we have the Polo sedan, the Jetta, and the Passat. In the SUV category we have the Tiguan, which is A-class, a smaller SUV, and the Touareg, which is our most successful model in the Middle East. Then, of course, we have the iconic Golf GTI, which is an extremely popular model with our customers across the region. We expect the Golf GTI to be available in 3Q2013, and it will offer an even more striking and sporty design, a 10 HP and 70 NM increase of torque and a guarantee of the highest fun factor ever experienced in a GTI.</p><div class="quote">“We are in an incredibly exciting stage of Volkswagen Middle East's development."</div><h4>Speaking of safety, how important is it in a region like this?</h4><p>At Volkswagen, we make great cars that are fun to drive, but it is safety that is always of the utmost importance to us. The road safety record in the Middle East could be better, which is why people really need to consider safety features when choosing a new car. Customers of Volkswagen know that safety is integral to the design and engineering of every car we develop, which is why eight of our models were recently named 2013 Top Safety Picks by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety in the US.</p><h4>Why are SUVs and family cars so popular in the region?</h4><p>In my opinion this can be attributed to a number of factors. For example, there are cultural influences, which can probably be attributed to the predominance of large family units with locals across the Gulf. I also think there may be a misconception that the bigger a car is, the safer it is. For a number of technical reasons this is not always the case. However, with regards to Volkswagen, we consistently engineer our cars to make sure that the best possible systems and support are provided for both the driver and passengers.</p><h4>Do you think it is possible to top the growth you had in 2012?</h4><p>It was certainly successful for Volkswagen Middle East in terms of sales growth and our aim is to build on that success in 2013 and then year-on-year. With the support of our regional partners, Volkswagen Middle East remains committed to providing its customers with the world-class products and service excellence they demand and expect. We know that in order to continue to be successful and to drive the Volkswagen brand forward we need ongoing investment in our facilities, customer service, and the launch of new models, which is exactly what we are delivering.</p><h4>Volkswagen has plans to roll out seven new facilities in the GCC. How are these plans progressing?</h4><p>We are in an incredibly exciting stage of Volkswagen Middle East's development. The introduction of these new facilities not only demonstrates our continued growth, but also our commitment to the region. In the UAE, we will be launching state-of-the-art dealerships in Sharjah and in Fujairah. In Qatar we have just opened a brand new service facility, which we are now in the process of moving into. Also, in Qatar we have a brand new, state-of-the-art showroom that will open later in 2013. We are currently planning a new facility in Oman close to the airport and expect this to be open in 2014. And finally, we are planning to build the biggest showroom in the world in Kuwait, so there are exciting times ahead.</p><h4>What makes this Emirate unique amongst all of the regions?</h4><p>The biggest difference between Dubai and the other Emirates, and even other countries across the region, is the large population of expatriates. This obviously offers Volkswagen a great opportunity because many of these Dubai-based expatriates come from Asia and Europe and have had more exposure to Volkswagen and understand that it is a brand synonymous with quality and great engineering. Whilst these expatriates contribute greatly to our sales, the local populations are also strong Volkswagen supporters. Volkswagen Middle East has built a solid customer base throughout the region and we intend to continue to work in close partnership with all of our regional dealers to promote our rich heritage and great engineering, all of which will continue to replicate our success in Dubai across the region on a wider scale.</p><h4>How well developed is the new car market?</h4><p>Customers in the region generally keep their cars for three to five years, although some enthusiasts buy the latest Volkswagen model every 12 months. That is why we now offer a three-year warranty and most of our cars have a five-year warranty, whereby the dealers add two years.</p><h4>Looking ahead to this year and into 2014, what are your targets?</h4><p>We will follow the strategy we are already implementing. Our targets are in line with the growth of our business, and as we achieve these targets we will continue to invest in our dealers and in our products. Volkswagen is known for being a superior product and this is where we continuously make our investments to ensure we provide German engineering for everyone. Providing service excellence and offering our customers the best possible service packages are also always top priorities for us.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the Ministry's plans to capitalize on increasing non-oil FDI that is flowing specifically into the ICT sector?<br></h4><p>President Ilham Aliyev declared the ICT sector as a priority field and emphasized that the future of the Azerbaijani economy will be directly related to this field. The transition from Azerbaijan's historical resource base to the technological and innovative economy is a vital issue. It is a separate part of the policy, which is designed to direct the income gained from natural resources to the long-term development of the non-oil sectors. Moving the ICT sector to the foreground among other fields of the economy is directly bound to the fact that ICT has emerged as the most profitable area in our modern life. Our strategic approach is that the ICT sector should follow the oil and gas sectors in terms of its business environment and profitability. There is a favorable investment environment in Azerbaijan and our country is at the top level in the former Soviet world for the volume of FDI per capita. We are taking certain measures to encourage the stimulation of foreign investments. Our government is financing the most important investment projects in the ICT sector from the state budget. Our goal is not only to create a legal-normative base, but also to strengthen the private sector and its involvement in infrastructure projects. In this regard, we hope that billions of US dollars from private funds will be invested into ICT, and our country will take part in this process together with local companies. It is anticipated that ICT will obtain more investments from the private sector. In order to expand the role of the private sector in ICT at present, specially enhanced material, and a financial and investment environment are being created. A number of important steps have been taken in this field. The establishment of the State Foundation for ICT Development within the Ministry of Communications and Information Technologies is a significant event in order to support manufacture-oriented activity. At the same time, certain steps are being taken to create a favorable investment environment in the country. The modification of fiscal policies and legal bases in the ICT market, the application of customs and tax concessions, the creation of more convenient financial-credit conditions, the provision of a favorable competitive environment for market players, and the protection of investments are important indicators of the policy.</p><h4>What were the most significant achievements in the local ICT sector in 2012?</h4><p>The development of the ICT sector in Azerbaijan is proof of socioeconomic growth, which is observed throughout the country. Referring to the statistical figures, I can say that the ICT sector has increased by seven or eight times over the last decade, with an average annual growth rate of 25%-30%. In 2012, the growth rate was 18.2% and the volume of the sector exceeded ‚¬1.5 billion. Approximately 80% of the income falls to the private sector, and it is the result of expedient arrangements carried out regarding the improvement of the business environment and the strengthening of private sector activity. The country now has full telephone penetration and full digitalization of telecommunications and banking services. The Doing Business report in 2013, recently issued by the World Bank and International Financial Corporation, speaks favorably about business and investment in our country. Azerbaijan has taken 67th place among the 185 countries in the report. The first ever Azerbaijan-US ICT Forum was held in 2012, “Risks and Opportunities in the Global Internet Space," together with the World Economic Forum (Davos), the 47th meeting of the Council of the Heads of the Administrations of RCC, and meetings of the 18th Coordination Council of CIS member states. All these high-level events proved vividly the availability of free internet in Azerbaijan and the realities of the dynamic development of the ICT field in the country. Institutional steps have been taken for the purpose of strengthening the potential of ICT and more widely the free usage of state-of-the-art technology by society. During 2012, the IT Foundation, High Technologies Park, and E-Security Center were established. By order of the President, the creation of the High Technologies Park (technopark) dated November 5, 2012, was an important step within the framework of the creation of Special Innovation Zones. The main mission behind the presidential decree is to carry out important projects such as the creation of resource centers, the development of SMEs, the increase of export opportunities, and the training of ICT specialists, which should fit the philosophy of bridging the scientific and manufacturing fields for the country's ICT sector. The companies operating there will be provided with tax and customs concessions. Also, the newly created companies will be provided with logistical and technical support. They will be advised by experienced lawyers, financiers, managers, and IT experts, as well as get an opportunity to obtain valuable advice and recommendations. The electronic signature project, which strengthens the development of SMEs in the country, public activity, and the employment of citizens, also gives ample opportunity to fight corruption and provide for government transparency. Today, the provision of e-services for the population is carried out by a single portal. There are 162 out of 417 services that are provided to the population through the “Electronic Government" portal. The number of citizens using electronic services is approximately 10% today. Our target for 2020 is to fully digitalize state services, providing 100% access to e-services. The “Optic to Home" project, which we attach an enormous importance, aims to deliver a fiber-optic network to all settlements in our country.</p><h4>What challenges does the Ministry face in order to maintain a high growth rate in the ICT sector?</h4><p>President Ilham Aliyev has always paid ample attention to the development of ICT in Azerbaijan. The first foreign visit made by President Aliyev following the presidential election was the World Summit on the Information Society in 2003, and he noted in his speech that the future development perspectives of the country are connected to ICT. Targets and challenges in connection with the long-term development of the sector were determined by the “National ICT Strategy for the Development of Azerbaijan (2003-2012)" and two other state programs adopted afterward. So far, 70% of the country's population use the internet, and 50% use high-speed internet in 87% of the populated territories. Computers and notebooks produced in Azerbaijan are exported to other countries in the region. In February 2013, the country's first telecommunications satellite was launched into orbit. The appropriate e-government infrastructure has been established, the application of e-signatures has started, and electronic services are being provided by most state agencies. We have many targets, such as increasing the access of all settlements to broadband internet, the application of e-services, the creation of technoparks, and the manufacturing of scientific products along with the establishment and development of the space industry.</p><div class="quote">“The ICT sector should follow the oil and gas sectors in terms of its business environment and profitability."</div><h4>What successes can Azerbaijan draw on from having hosted the UN-sponsored Internet Governance Forum (IGF) in 2012?</h4><p>Firstly, we would like to note that Azerbaijan has closely participated in the process of hosting the 7th IGF since day one. The most significant results of the second phase of the World Summit on the Information Society held in Tunis on November 16-18, 2005 was the establishment of the IGF, which aims to enhance the durability, reliability, security, stability, and development of the internet and to support dialogue between enterprises engaged with complex international political issues regarding its use. The 7th IGF was held under the motto, “Internet Governance for Sustainable Human, Economic, and Social Development." Wu Hongbo, UN Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA), Neelie Kroes, Vice-President of the European Commission responsible for the Digital Agenda for Europe, Fadi Chehadé, President of the ICANN, Hamadoun Touré, Secretary-General of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), and Philip Verveer, the US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State and the US Coordinator for International Communications and Information Policy all participated in the IGF meeting. Along with them, in general, it encompassed more than 5,000 guests representing 128 countries. Locally, more than 1,200 participants—mostly volunteers—joined from Azerbaijan, as well. The number of participants who joined the IGF online from various countries throughout the world was around 3,000. Government, private sector, civil society, internet amateurs, international organizations, and mass media representatives attended the event and discussed the future growth of the internet and the ICT sector at large.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the achievements of the Ministry of Industry and Energy in 2012?<br></h4><p>It was a successful year because we increased our GDP by more than 9% in the industrial sector. We have implemented several projects in metallurgy and construction. More than 100 new plants were constructed in Azerbaijan in 2012. At the moment, the GDP share of industry is about 54%. Industry is an important part of our economy. We tried to develop industry because traditionally the Azerbaijani economy was based on the oil and gas sector. Energy is the main sphere of Azerbaijan's economy, and we are very happy to develop the oil and gas industry. Since 1994, oil production volumes have increased by more than five times and gas volumes have increased by more than four times. Azerbaijan is now energy self-sufficient in terms of oil and gas. The second factor in our policy is to become an exporting country, which we believe we have achieved. Also, we want to increase our reserves. We have increased our reserves not just in oil, but also in gas. We recently discovered new fields, and we are very encouraged that companies are discovering new ones. We now have gas reserves of over 2 trillion cubic meters. What we are working on now is to diversify our roots by working with the European Commission. In regards to this, we created a team of which I am one of the co-chairmen. What we are doing is working on developing a new Southern Gas Corridor. It means that all of the gas from the Caspian region, especially Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan, will go to Europe via the Caspian Sea, Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey. A pipeline already exists through Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey, and now we are expanding this corridor. We made the decision to extend the capacity up to 56 billion cubic meters (bcm), which will be implemented in the near future. We are beginning a very important era of communications between Azerbaijan and Turkey to transport gas across the borders of our countries to Europe. In 2012, Azerbaijan made tremendous progress in this direction. The Trans-Anatolian gas pipeline (TANAP) will be an extraordinary project for Azerbaijan and Turkey because it ties the two countries to Europe. This link will be very important for all the economies in the Caspian Sea region across to the Mediterranean. In the electricity sector, we had a lot of success in 2012 by implementing many new projects to produce electricity. We increased the capacity of our electrical stations, and now we have no problem regarding supply for our people and cities. Now, we are working to take our first steps in renewables. In 2012, we implemented a pilot project in the renewable sector, and constructed a photovoltaic plant in Sumgait. We have a new strategy and program for developing renewables, and we expect 2013 to be successful year in this regard.</p><h4>How would you characterize the non-oil potential of Azerbaijan's industries?</h4><p>This is a very important but complicated issue. Traditionally, in the Soviet period Azerbaijan was an oil and gas country. In the first years of our independence, our economy was based on the oil and gas industry. To develop the non-oil sector, we need a lot of investment, capital, and finance. At the beginning, Azerbaijan had no money. We had a lot of potential, but no base. The financial institutions could not be assured if they lent money to Azerbaijan, as it was a risky country. The only way to go forward was to develop our oil and gas industry, which we did, and now we have developed our oil fund to more than $45 billion. This means that we can implement projects to develop the non-oil sector. We started with infrastructure, because it is clear that without infrastructure you cannot develop any economy. This also includes the market's infrastructure. Each region of Azerbaijan has its own ideas on how to develop certain industries, but the government is working on several programs, which are to be initiated and approved by the President. Step-by-step, we have to develop the non-oil sector in Azerbaijan.</p><h4>How do you intend to capitalize on the companies in the offshore fields?</h4><p>For the Ministry, the main goal is to create a base to increase our reserves. One way is with SOCAR, which is working with the government, and the second way is with foreign investments. Some years ago, we had no money for exploration because it was very expensive and capital intensive. The cost of drilling is over $100 million. Now, we have the opportunity and this is why SOCAR expanded its drilling operations in the Caspian Sea. We discovered new gas fields and it has been a huge success. Foreign companies have a duty to invest money in exploration work. They need to drill no less than two drills when exploring. Another success story is that Total drilled a well and discovered new gas fields as well. That is why in our Ministry, foreign companies have helped and supported us, and we created laws regarding equipment delivery and customs payments. We created a fair regime in which foreign companies can work. It is very important for us to increase the exploration of wells, not just for SOCAR, but also for all our partners. We work on the basis of a production-sharing agreement (PSA).</p><div class="quote">“We increased the capacity of our electrical stations, and now we have no problem regarding supply for our people and cities."</div><h4>How do you evaluate Azerbaijan's potential to become a regional energy hub?</h4><p>We achieved this goal when we increased Azerbaijan's gas and oil reserves. Our main goal is to produce this oil and gas, and the second is to deliver it to foreign markets. We fulfilled our duties in Azerbaijan and we produced 45 million tons of oil and 27 bcm of gas in 2012. This means that Azerbaijan can meet its own needs. Azerbaijan consumes about 12 bcm of gas annually; the rest is exported. Turkmenistan announced that it is ready to transport gas across the Caspian to Europe, but we don't know when that will be. We are in negotiations about the construction of a cross-Caspian pipeline. We are talking about the obstacles, circumstances, and volumes, as there are some issues that have not yet been solved. If other countries would like to cross Azerbaijan with their oil, gas, or energy resources, we will do our best to deliver it across our territories.</p><h4>What is the Ministry doing to increase the use of sustainable energy?</h4><p>We have never depended on renewables before. Only 14% was produced by hydroelectric stations and 1% was renewables. That is why we never used wind or solar energy. Renewables is a very highly developed industry, and some countries have more than a 20% share in sustainable energy. That is why we are taking the first steps toward renewables, and the President established an agency within the Ministry. This agency will start to work on the regulations for renewable energy. We are trying to learn and study from other countries to see what is the most effective method for Azerbaijan. We created a map of renewables and a database, and we are implementing small pilot projects. In 2011, to increase the volume of work the President issued a decree and created an independent renewables company. This company will implement practical projects to create power stations using renewable sources, such as hydro, wind, or solar. We created a program up until 2020, and we want to achieve no less than a 12% share in renewable energy. We have the right climates here and a lot of windy days, especially in certain regions. We also have a lot of sunny days, so we can use solar energy very effectively. Azerbaijan has thermal waters in the north. We have to develop these renewable sources. It is the first step, but a very important one.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of SOCAR's major developments over the past 12 months?</h4><p>In 2012, 43.3 million tons of oil and 26.9 billion cubic meters (bcm) of natural gas were produced in the country. Of these, 8.3 million tons of oil and 6.9 bcm of natural gas were produced by SOCAR. In order to maintain the stability of production from the fields that we operate in, we carried out 715 geological and 3,700 technical activities, which enabled the production of an additional 322,000 tons of oil. We have also conducted exploration work, with the drilling of more than 130,000 meters, resulting in the launch of 86 new wells. In addition, SOCAR completed the construction of a compressor station in the Gunashli field. Production has begun at the Umid field and the drilling of a second well is under way. There has been renewed interest in Caspian exploration, and in particular for gas.</p><h4>What significance does this have in terms of energy security for Europe?</h4><p>The Absheron field was discovered in the Azerbaijani sector of the Caspian with French company Total in 2011. The field is believed to contain 350 bcm of gas and 45 million tons of condensate. Taking into consideration the commencement of Shah Deniz II, as well as SOCAR's discovery of the Umid field (with 200 bcm of gas and 40 million tons of condensate) in 2010, this development is expected to enhance Azerbaijan's role in the energy security spectrum of Europe. As interest in and demand for natural gas in the modern world rises, so does the importance of Azerbaijan as a reliable gas exporter. Today, our country has fully ensured its energy security for many years to come and is playing a significant role in the energy security of the region. Azerbaijan already exports natural gas to Georgia, Turkey, and Russia. At the same time, our gas is exported through Turkey to Greece, thus reaching the EU market. Azerbaijan extensively supports the implementation of the Southern Gas Corridor strategy initiated by the EU. We are fully aware of the responsibility we have for the opening of this energy corridor, which will serve many generations of Europeans. We are currently reviewing several options for exporting Azerbaijani gas to EU countries on the basis of long-term agreements, including the proposed Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) and the Nabucco-West gas pipeline projects.</p><p>Our relations with EU countries in many areas, including energy, rest on a strong foundation of mutually beneficial cooperation. Azerbaijan has been a reliable supplier of oil to Europe for many years. The commissioning of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) oil pipeline in 2006 provided direct access for Azerbaijani oil destined for the Mediterranean Sea region via Turkey. This was the first non-OPEC and non-Russian oil exported to Europe, and it plays a significant role in the energy security of Europe. We share the energy security concerns of other countries and aim to develop mechanisms of reliable and uninterrupted energy supplies in order to resolve any emerging problems. Our relations with the EU in the area of energy security are based on the Southern Gas Corridor strategy. The signing by President Aliyev and President of the European Commission José Manuel Barroso of a Joint Declaration in Baku in January 2011 was a fundamental turning point in the implementation of this strategy.</p><p>We are confident that the successful implementation of the Southern Gas Corridor strategy will elevate relations between Azerbaijan and the EU, thus contributing to the energy security of Europe. At a time when energy supply routes are diversified and energy security issues in the region are closely intertwined, it is important to further promote the diversification of gas supply sources and routes to Europe and implement the agreements we have reached.</p><p>The initial stages of Azerbaijani gas exports are associated with Shah Deniz II. We are currently carrying the necessary preparatory work with our partners to start the full-field development of this $25-billion project. Gas production under Shah Deniz II is expected to reach at least 16 bcm per year.</p><p>Our long-term strategy also provides for the development of fields discovered in recent years, which have significantly expanded Azerbaijan's oil and gas potential. These include Absheron, Umid, and Babak, as well as the gas reserves discovered in the deep horizons of the Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli (ACG) field. At present, the country's recoverable gas reserves are estimated at 2.5 trillion cubic meters. The predicted gas potential is around 6 trillion cubic meters. If we add to this the recoverable and predicted oil reserves, it can be said that Azerbaijan has a total of around 10 billion tons of hydrocarbon resources. By 2025, Azerbaijan will be exporting at least 40 bcm-50 bcm of gas, and we believe that most of the gas will be exported to Europe.</p><p>Obviously, the transportation of such huge volumes of hydrocarbons from Azerbaijan to Europe requires the presence of safe and reliable oil and gas transit infrastructure that can increase throughput capacity whenever necessary. The Trans-Anatolian Pipeline (TANAP) will be one such system. The construction of this pipeline has been incorporated into the consolidated energy export plan of the country. The initial throughput capacity of this new Azerbaijani-Turkish pipeline will be 16 bcm. Of these, 6 bcm will meet the domestic needs of Turkey. There is a possibility that the capacity of the pipeline will be subsequently increased to 30 bcm. In the longer term, in addition to the gas produced from Azerbaijani fields, this pipeline will transport gas from other Caspian littoral countries through Azerbaijan and Turkey to Europe.</p><h4>SOCAR has developed downstream capabilities with the purchase of Esso filling stations from ExxonMobil in 2013. Can we expect further international activity from SOCAR?</h4><p>We have to expand our downstream business to the European market due to its proximity. In order to increase the profitability of our operations, we have to develop crude oil, refine it, and sell it on the retail market in order to enjoy the full benefit of oil production and supply. The Esso asset was on sale, we participated in the tender and successfully won. This marks our first foray into Western Europe. We do have other operations outside of Azerbaijan though. The first network of filling stations by us was in Romania, we also have a network in Ukraine and Georgia, and we will eventually expand to Turkey. Depending on the conditions, terms, and opportunities, further expansion cannot be ruled out.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the current investment climate in the local energy sector?</h4><p>There is a favorable environment for foreign companies to invest in Azerbaijan. There is legal and regulatory framework available to promote and protect foreign investment. Important agreements, including production-sharing agreements (PSAs), are ratified by parliament and signed into law by the President. To date, foreign companies have invested $50 billion in the country's oil industry, and not a single energy agreement has been breached or amended.</p><h4>Moving forward, what are SOCAR's medium-term plans?</h4><p>We have ambitious plans for the near- and medium-term future. SOCAR and its foreign partners are continuing the construction of the largest shipyard in the Caspian region in Baku. The shipyard will launch its first ship in 2013. The commissioning of the shipyard will help renew the Caspian oil fleet specialized in large-scale exploration, drilling, construction, and repair operations, as well as provide companies in Azerbaijan and other countries of the region with modern tankers and ships. In addition to Azerbaijan, we are also implementing important oil refining and petrochemical projects in Turkey. In order to provide gas for the Petkim enterprise in Turkey, in which SOCAR owns a 61.32% share, we have built a new refinery there. In 2011, we started the expansion of a port in Turkey. Furthermore, the construction of a thermal power plant is expected to commence in Turkey in the near future. As a result of the construction and reconstruction operations we have carried out, Petkim will soon become one of the largest petrochemical centers and ports of the region.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your top-three targets for 2013, and what is your strategy in order to achieve them?</h4><p>My primary target is to continue to deliver our huge business here in a safe and reliable manner. As operator of Azerbaijan's world-class oil and gas fields, we take pride in our safety and environmental record in the Caspian. For 20 years, we have been the country's reliable partner in developing its huge oil and gas resources for the benefit of the people of Azerbaijan and our partners. We have built an excellent partnership with the people, the government, SOCAR, and other stakeholders. My task is to further develop our safe delivery and reliable partnership. Secondly, I will focus on our production targets. In 2012, our total production from the Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli (ACG) fields was 664,000 barrels per day (bbl/d), which is slightly lower than 33 million tons. Recently, we have thoroughly analyzed our plans for ACG production stabilization and decline management and identified opportunities to respond to the technical challenges presented by the field. We have worked closely with SOCAR to find ways to ensure improved production delivery from 2013 onwards. As a result, we plan to intensify work on new well delivery, focus on some other key production areas, and also complete the Chirag Oil Project activities onshore and offshore, which is scheduled for start up during 4Q2013. My third target would be to further progress the Shah Deniz II project by achieving the milestones scheduled for mid-2013—the selection of the European pipeline. This would be followed by the historic, final investment decision that will allow us to commence the execution phase of this giant gas development and export project.</p><h4>What do the recent discoveries in the Shah Deniz block represent for the company, and is there any further offshore exploration planned for Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Indeed, some years ago we announced a further major new gas-condensate discovery in the Shah Deniz field. As a result of our appraisal and exploration wells, we discovered a new high-pressure gas condensate reservoir in a deeper structure below the currently producing reservoir, which extends the field to the south. While we believe this exploration discovery represents a potentially significant find and is a tremendous success for the Shah Deniz partnership and for Azerbaijan, such a deep, high-pressure reservoir will require new technologies that are presently under development in the industry. Therefore, our current focus is to develop Shah Deniz II with plans to produce an additional 16 billion cubic meters (bcm) per annum of gas to supply regional and European markets. This project is well advanced and with the final investment decision planned for later in 2013, we aim to get the first gas to the markets in 2018. However, I strongly believe that Shah Deniz has the potential for a Phase III and even further developments.</p><h4>How would you evaluate Azerbaijan's role as an energy hub in the future?</h4><p>Azerbaijan clearly has the potential to rightly play an important role in the world's energy supply market. It is already a regional energy hub with its 1.2 million bbl/d capacity Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline, which in addition to ACG has always welcomed third-party volumes from across the Caspian. There are also two other pipelines—the Baku-Supsa pipeline delivering oil to the Black Sea, and the South Caucasus Pipeline supplying around 7 bcm of gas to Georgia and Turkey. We believe with the start up of Shah Deniz II when Azerbaijan's gas enters European markets, Azerbaijan will become more visible and important as an oil and gas supplier. Phase II, with its total planned capital investment of approximately $40 billion, is currently one of the largest projects anywhere in the world and definitely the largest in BP's worldwide portfolio. We are very glad it will underpin Azerbaijan's plans to establish itself as a major provider of gas to Europe.</p><h4>How does BP help develop national staff?</h4><p>I am proud to be able to say that the vast majority of our employees here are national employees. Since the earliest days of our presence in Baku, we have prioritized national staff development as one of the key elements of our support for the development of the country's energy sector. For many years, we have operated a world-class training facility in Baku that has enabled us to train hundreds of technicians who are doing an excellent job running our complex offshore and onshore operations safely and efficiently. In September 2012, we launched an equally important training program for geoscientists, and surface and drilling engineers. This is a multi-million dollar learning initiative called the petro-technical resource entry program, which is aimed at the capability development of national petro-technical graduates joining BP. In addition, we have a series of local university support programs that aim to promote the education of petro-technical and related disciplines. We hope these initiatives will help us increase still further our annual intake of petro-technical national graduates as it is these disciplines where we still depend heavily on expatriate skills and experience. We directly employ about 2,600 Azerbaijani nationals, with growing numbers in middle and senior leadership positions. Our expatriate staff are expected to coach and develop national colleagues, and transfer key skills in the process. Building the capability of our workforce through hiring and developing the best talent that we can find is one of my key priorities.</p><h4>How would you assess the changes in Azerbaijan's economic development over the past decade?</h4><p>I think a comparison of the 2013 state budget with that of 10 years ago describes the changes in Azerbaijan's economic development over the past decade more impressively than anything else. The government has approved a record high-state budget—circa $25 billion—for 2013. This is huge for a nation with a population of just over 9 million. Economically, Azerbaijan has been developing at an amazingly fast pace. I am aware that according to the assessment of the Davos World Economic Forum, Azerbaijan now ranks 46th globally and is at the top of the former Soviet countries for the competitiveness of its economy. Also, it is very encouraging to see that the 2012 GDP increase was also sourced from non-oil sector growth, which means that the country is skillfully shifting its growth leverages to the non-oil sector. As Azerbaijan's long-term oil and gas development partner, we are pleased to observe that the country is gaining increased recognition as a major contributor to European cultural and sports events. With the success of hosting the Eurovision 2012 Song Contest, Azerbaijan has now been elected as the host country for the first European Olympic Games scheduled for 2015. All this indicates that the country is clearly committed to maintaining the high pace of growth for many years, with greater integration into the world economy, sports, and culture.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Azerbaijan's energy sector in 2013? What are the medium-term plans of BP in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>We believe Azerbaijan's energy sector has the potential to grow for decades. The government has signed a number of new production sharing agreements (PSA), including the one between BP and SOCAR on the joint exploration and development of the Shafag-Asiman structure. We have already conducted the first 3D seismic in that area, and we are currently at the data processing stage, which will continue through 2013. The structure is very promising, and we look forward to our first exploration well in a few years time. We also believe that the country's energy future is very much linked to its plans to become a global gas supplier. These plans are mainly based on Shah Deniz. During 4Q2012, we increased the capacity of the entire Stage 1 system to 966 million cubic feet per day (mmcfd), which is almost 10 bcm. We currently have five producing wells and these deliver record rates of producing almost full capacity. Total production in 2012 was around 8 bcm of gas and over 2 million tons of condensate, and in 2013 we expect even higher production levels. Stage 2 has also made significant progress. Great achievements have been made on progressing the South Caucasus Pipeline Expansion (SCPX) with the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) disclosed in January 2013. Great progress has been achieved on the new Trans-Anatolian Pipeline (TANAP), which is planned to be built in Turkey and is set to become a key part of the Southern Gas Corridor linking Azerbaijan's extensive gas resources to Turkish and EU markets. We strongly support TANAP, and we are working closely with other project participants to acquire a 12% interest in this project. We are on track to make the European pipeline selection in mid-2013, with a final investment decision planned for later in 2013.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What strategies led you to enter Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Statoil is a young company. We were formed in 1972 and recently celebrated our 40th anniversary. We were originally formed as Norway's state vehicle to explore newly found resources in the North Sea. During the 1970s and 1980s, we were still a 100% state-owned company with activities in Norway. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, we began internationalizing our operations and trying to get footholds in different parts of the world. One of these places was Azerbaijan, along with Angola, Algeria, and a few other locations. Today, Azerbaijan is the second largest contributor to our international production—it contributes about 100,000 barrels per day (bbl/d) to a global production of about 2 million bbl/d. About 1.5 million bbl/d comes from Norway, and about 20% of our international production comes from Azerbaijan.</p><h4>How would you evaluate your success over the past two decades in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>The company has been very successful. We have partners in Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli (ACG) and Shah Deniz, which are the two biggest fields in Azerbaijan, both offshore. We don't operate anything here physically—it is BP that operates them and we are partners. We have what is known as a commercial operatorship; we sell gas through the Azerbaijani gas supply company and that is operated by Statoil, which means that we are here selling gas. We also have the South Caucasus Pipeline Company, which is operated by Statoil—we basically take care of all the administration of running the pipeline, whilst BP physically runs it. We have 60 people in the office. </p><p>We are small, but it is still a big investment; we have invested more than $6 billion since the beginning of the project. Now, with the new Shah Deniz II project, which is still in the making and hasn't been approved yet, we will be more than doubling our investment in Azerbaijan. It is a major investment for Statoil. In 2013, we are taking the final investment decision, and that is also the communication from SOCAR and BP.</p><h4>What are your priorities here in the future?</h4><p>We are an upstream company. The hydrocarbons lie underground and we are interested in exploring them. We are also the world's largest offshore company, operating more than 3 million bbl/d offshore. That surprises many people. If anyone can expand their presence offshore, we can. We are a 2 million-bbl/d company, which is substantially larger than we were when we entered Azerbaijan in 1992. We are five times bigger than we were then, and we have more muscle to take on bigger challenges. We have been a partner here for 20 years, so an operatorship where we are the ones operating the fields is what we are going for. We have no specifics to go on for now, but we hope to get an opportunity to explore in the Caspian.</p><h4>What challenges exist here in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Operating in the Caspian is very challenging, but if you look at our operations outside Norway, with 38-meter waves and Arctic conditions, we can handle strong challenges. The area is geologically young, about 6 million years old. It is still young, still moving, and still settling, which is a challenge when you drill through rock like that. There are challenging environments here and you need to understand the technology and geology relatively well to master it.</p><h4>What ramifications will the Trans-Anatolian Pipeline (TANAP) have for Statoil?</h4><p>TANAP will be built eventually and Statoil is considering investing in it. In order to develop a project like Shah Deniz, we need to be able to transport products to the market. Georgia and Turkey are good markets and we are supplying them today. However, if we want to expand, we need to connect to the European market. TANAP will be a way to connect us to the EU market. It will mean the building of a highway for gas supplies to Europe.</p><h4>How will TANAP impact the issue of energy security for Europe?</h4><p>In terms of supply to Europe, TANAP will open up the Southern Gas Corridor. The first corridor is the Russian supply, the second is the Norwegian supply, the third is the North African supply, and the fourth would be the Caspian supply to Europe, which is an important strategic change for Europe. Right now, the gas markets in Europe and worldwide are fairly depressed. Parts of the world have an oversupply of gas and prices are dropping, which affects investment magnitude. Gas as a fuel is, from an energy efficiency point of view, the most efficient energy source that we have. It is less carbon emitting than oil and coal by far. As far as climate change is concerned, gas is the perfect fuel. If you look at the challenges Europe has for carbon emissions, gas is by far the best solution to that problem. If we change coal power plants over to gas, Europe would be 25% below its carbon target for 2020 already. It is not about if they can do it, it's about if there is a will to do it. There will be a will, I am sure, and the demand for gas in Europe is bound to pick up again in time.</p><h4>Are you looking to acquire a stake in the Nabucco West Pipeline?</h4><p>The Shah Deniz consortium is interested, and we are a part of that. Right now, the Shah Deniz consortium has a similar agreement with the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP). The Nabucco West Pipeline goes north and the TAP goes straight to Italy. At some point in time during 2013, the consortium will have to choose between Nabucco West and TAP, and, whichever one it chooses, the consortium would like to be co-owners. That is the agreement that is being negotiated. In Norway, we have been owners of the transportation network since it was built, and we have tried to balance our ownership with what we have the resources for. That has proven to be beneficial over time and that is our strategy. We are not a pipeline company—we are an upstream company—but if we have sufficient upstream sources, we would like to be owners of the pipeline as well. It is not necessary, but it is preferred.</p><h4>How would you describe Azerbaijan as a regional energy hub in the future?</h4><p>It is a hub for energy in Turkey, the EU, and Europe. Azerbaijan's position enables it to be a very large and reliable supplier for Europe, which is important for Azerbaijan and Europe going forward.</p><h4>What are your medium-term plans for the company?</h4><p>There are three steps; one is to make sure that we continue to be a partner on the Shah Deniz and ACG fields, to develop Shah Deniz II as a new source of energy and transportation to Europe, and to seek to introduce new positions within Azerbaijan. That is what we have been working on for a long time, and what we will continue to work on over the medium term.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the bank's first five years in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Pasha Bank's first five years have been a period of physical as well as institutional development. Our three main principles—transparency, integrity, and profitability—have been the foundations of our growth during this time, and they inform a very clear strategy as we look to the future. Thanks to these principles and the vision of our shareholders, Pasha Bank has established itself as a brand associated with ethical conduct and openness.  The corporate sector, including SMEs as well as larger companies, has been at the center of our focus, and we have earned the trust of the business community. We have also invested our time, effort, and resources in boosting financial education in Azerbaijan. We feel we have a responsibility to the market, and we want to become a driving force for good corporate governance so that our commercial sector is as healthy and transparent as our financial sector. We also help universities that teach business and train financial journalists. We want to be known for our efforts in extending the market and encouraging competition, because we believe competition is a good thing; it brings depth and quality to the market.</p><h4>What is your strategy looking forward?</h4><p>We are now well into our second three-year strategy plan, which again is focused on corporate banking. Our operations are seeing robust growth, and we are excited about the future. Total banking assets are very low in Azerbaijan, occupying just 5% of GDP. This presents a great opportunity for overall sector growth. Nevertheless we plan to outgrow the sector. This is part of our strategy to increase our market share from its current 5%. Central to this strategy is the development and support of SMEs, which we believe are the backbone of the economy. Our intention is to make our client base 60% SMEs and 40% corporates. Pasha Bank supports small players to help them grow and develop in the market, and at the same time we want to split our activities fairly evenly. We are also developing private banking, which is part of our strategy to establish merchant and investment banking. We met our private-banking targets in 2012 and are putting into place even more ambitious objectives for 2013. We are now entering the third successful year of our seven-year private-banking strategy.</p><h4>What differentiates Pasha Bank from its competitors?</h4><p>We are not a transaction-driven bank. Instead, we believe in the relationship-banking model, for both corporate and private banking. We focus on what clients need rather than on selling banking products and have developed an open-architecture system, meaning that we do not limit our clients to specific services. We are prepared to support our clients' activities inside and outside of Azerbaijan, to open accounts at other banks, and to handle deposits. This is something we are promoting in the market. Ideologically, it is different from what we have traditionally seen in Azerbaijan, but we are always with our clients.</p><div class="quote">“Our intention is to make our client base 60% SMEs and 40% corporates."</div><h4>What are your current expansion plans within Azerbaijan?</h4><p>We believe that regional development is important for Azerbaijan, so for the first time in the bank's history we will expand throughout the country. First, we will start with the West and North-West, and in the coming two years shift our focus to the northern and southern regions. Specifically, we will be opening new business centers, which is what we call our offices since we are not a retail bank. Currently we have four business centers, including a head office, and they are all located in Baku. Instead of opening branches throughout the country, we will be opening regional centers to oversee our operations in each city. The immediate plan for 2013 is to open business centers in Ganja and Zaqatala, which will cover a wide region extending to Sheki and the Georgian border.</p><h4>How are your international operations progressing?</h4><p>In December 2012, we opened Pasha Bank Georgia. We are currently finalizing the documentation and acquiring all the licenses in order to be fully operational in 2013. We are also investigating the Swiss market for private and corporate banking opportunities as well as looking at possible entry points in the Turkish market. Aside from this, Pasha Bank has a number of strong international partnerships. For example, we are corporate governance beneficiaries of the IFC program in Azerbaijan and work with the Black Sea Trade and Development Bank. We also work with banks in Turkey, Europe, the US, Southeast Asia, China, and Japan. This broad global footprint allows us to support any client who is looking to do business in different parts of the world. We are able to accompany them, help them establish local relationships, and provide insights into new markets. We are equally ambitious about moving forward both regionally and internationally.</p><h4>How does Pasha Bank provide diverse banking services?</h4><p>We do this in a number of ways. For example, we are issuing cards that offer our clients a number of features that previously didn't exist in the market. We have both Visa and MasterCard, and this ancillary service brings significant value and convenience to our corporate and SME clients. Internet banking is another important dimension of our diverse product and service mix. We began offering fully operational internet banking services in 2012, and we believe that in terms of ease of use, customer friendliness, and security, it is one of the best platforms in the local market. One-on-one contact will remain at the heart of our customer-based model. However, we will continue to develop this direct online banking model in order to provide better service. The movement toward the use of remote access models is a trend that we will closely watch and pioneer in Azerbaijan. Again in terms of customer service, Pasha Bank offers a 24-hour concierge service, whereby our customers enjoy services and features anywhere in the world. The response has been tremendous. For example, many of our clients purchased tickets to the UEFA Euro 2012 championship in Kiev or sent presents from across the Atlantic. Other features include insurance for medical incidents or accidents while traveling. We are continually exploring services that may bring value or opportunity to our clients. For example, we are currently investigating the development of Azerbaijani legislation regarding Islamic finance, particularly in terms of investment funds. If we see the right environment for this, we may offer these new services to our clients.</p><h4>How would you characterize changes to the banking sector over the past decade?</h4><p>Since 1995, when I first began my career in the banking sector, I have witnessed 17 years of dynamic changes. The pace of change has also increased since the beginning of 2003, when President Aliyev took over and his policy to grow the economy was enacted. The economy has become viable and capable of weathering storms such as the financial crisis during 2007 and 2008. The argument can be made that Azerbaijan lacks certain regulations and liberalization, but in comparison to what is being seen in other post-Soviet nations in just 20 years, we have made progress. Imagining the next 20 years of our future, I am very positive about the business climate in the country. The administration actively supports private sector development. We also have an entrepreneurial spirit as a country, and this combination will make the country very strong and competitive in the world.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the major accomplishments of the International Bank of Azerbaijan (IBA) over the last year?</h4><p>The last 12 months were special for us not only because the bank has made outstanding achievements and strengthened its market position, but also because IBA has marked its 20th anniversary. Over the past two decades, the bank has become the largest financial institution not only in the country, but in the South Caucasus, occupying a strong position in the market. IBA founded a network of subsidiary banks and representations abroad. Today, IBA has more than 1,200 professionals working in 36 branches across the country, serving more than 800,000 individual customers and more than 14,000 corporate clients. Also, the bank's shareholders have decided to increase its share capital by $127 million, bringing it to $433 million. Plus, in 2012 the bank attracted a $191 million subordinated loan from the Central Bank of Azerbaijan Republic (CBAR) for a period of five years. The special subordinated loan will be counted under Tier I Capital. In 2012, IBA announced the opening of its Islamic window, and the starting up of Islamic banking and finance activities. IBA has attracted a loan of $145 million from Credit Suisse International, which may be considered unique, as in the practice of Azerbaijan, loans of such a volume have not been attracted for a long time.</p><h4>IBA announced in late 2012 that the total amount of deposits had increased significantly since 2011. To what do you attribute this success?</h4><p>The total deposit portfolio of IBA has demonstrated growth of 21% over the last 12 months and reached AZN2.71 billion as of October 1, 2012. In the first three quarters of 2011, IBA held 25.6% of Azerbaijan's banking sector deposits. In the same period of 2012 its share increased to 27%. We continue to observe the growth of this performance, which confirms that people trust IBA. It is precisely this fact that explains why during the financial crisis IBA managed to maintain the growth of the deposit portfolio. Deposits by the population in IBA increased more than twice from October 2009 to October 2012, from AZN508.1 million to AZN1.13 billion. Private customers represent a major area of IBA's business. The bank has significantly enhanced the volume of services provided to private customers over the past years. For example, our new “Golden Deposit" allows customers to place a deposit in gold, without its physical obtainment. In the future the bank plans not only to continue cooperation with private customers, but also strengthen it.</p><h4>IBA formally announced the launch of an Islamic banking branch in September 2012. What efforts are being made to promote Islamic banking in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>After overall studies of the domestic banking legislation, a special decision has been passed to offer customers a number of Islamic banking services. Today, Azerbaijan's Law on Banks allows Islamic banking only for trading operations with precious stones, precious metals, and securities, and uses certain financing instruments. The services offered by IBA are commodity murabaha (transactions with precious metals), mudaraba and vakala (deposit transactions and financial services), ijara (leasing), istisna (construction financing), and qard al-hasan (current accounts). The financial portfolio of the IBA department currently amounts approximately to $60 million. In the first quarter of 2013, IBA is planning to increase its Islamic banking operations. First of all, it will fund SMEs, services, retail, automotive, real estate, and consumer purchases. Special attention is going to be paid to international activities, in particular attracting investments to Azerbaijan and funding export operations to boost exports to foreign markets. The global financial crisis, which started in 2008, put a lot of the world's banks working on the basis of traditional principles in a very difficult situation. Many banks could not weather the overheating of the credit market and the mortgage crisis. However, banks operating under the principle of Islamic banking have managed to avoid the fate of their conventional peers. IBA is ready to open a subsidiary Islamic bank in Qatar. An Islamic bank in Qatar will become a reference point for Azerbaijani investors to enter markets in the GCC. Prior authorization to establish a fourth category bank in the Qatar Financial Centre has also been received.</p><h4>What is IBA doing in order to promote the use of plastic cards for payment in Azerbaijan, and what impact will the contract signed with Diners Club have on this?</h4><p>IBA attaches special importance to the business of banking cards, and carries out projects related to salary, pension, and social cards, which are services used by hundreds of thousands of people. To date, IBA's card activity represents 37.4% of the entire card market in the country, 30% of all ATMs, and 12.5% of the country's total point-of-sale (POS) terminals. IBA is a full member of Visa International and MasterCard International and is an exclusive partner of American Express and Diners Club. Acquiring services on Diners Club cards in the local market has its advantages. Today, Azerbaijan is becoming a center of tourism and organizes many international events, involving guests from different countries who are holders of Diners Club cards. Our cooperation with Diners Club will help the country's visitors to make payments in POS terminals operating in Azerbaijan and withdraw money from ATMs. Also, having a processing company of its own enables the bank to improve its quality of service and develop new products delivered to the holders of international plastic cards.</p><h4>What are your medium-term plans for IBA?</h4><p>Notwithstanding progress, IBA also has further plans for strengthening its positions in the financial and credit market. With that end in view, together with PwC, the bank has worked out a plan for its strategic development covering the 2010-2015 period. Also, it is no secret that IBA is the only national credit institution gradually expanding its presence in the global financial space. We don't want to stop at what has been accomplished, because we are aiming at growth and expansion.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the main successes that the Ministry has achieved?</h4><p>As a result of the consistent efforts and constant attention to environmental protection on the part of the worthy successor of great leader Heydar Aliyev, President Ilham Aliyev, the environmental situation in the country has dramatically improved. The rapid economic, social, cultural, and other developments of the country, and the successful implementation of the national oil strategy, have contributed to the solution of environmental problems. As a result of the successful environmental policy pursued by the President, significant achievements have been made in the area of the protection and environmental monitoring of forests, the protection and increase of biological resources, hydrometeorology, and geological exploration. The attention paid by President Ilham Aliyev to the implementation of state programs on environmental protection, the signing of relevant decisions to ensure the effective resolution of environmental issues, and the announcement of 2010 as “the Year of the Environment" are evidence of the fact that this area is a national priority. It is no coincidence that the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP) named the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, alongside Genoa, Italy, and Geneva, Switzerland, as the three European cities to mark the World Day of the Environment in 2010. This, above all, is the successful result of the consistent and focused activities carried out by President Ilham Aliyev to develop economic, social, cultural, and other aspects of life in the country, including the protection of the environmental balance.</p><h4>How would you describe efforts to promote the creation of national parks in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Due to the annual growth of reforestation activities in an effort to protect and enhance forests, the area of forests exceeded 1 million hectares over the last 10 years—an increase from 11.4% to 11.8%. Reforestation activities were carried out over an area of more than 104,500 hectares, where 82 million trees were planted, 307 million seed grains sown, and 2 million tons of seeds produced. It is worthy to note that over 6 million trees were planted in Azerbaijan in 2010 alone. As a result of the consistent measures to develop the protected natural territories and create an environmental network, the republic currently has 893,000 hectares of protected natural territories, including nine national parks, 11 state reserves, and 24 natural wildlife sanctuaries. Whereas in 2003 the protected natural territories accounted for 5.5% of the country's territory, now they cover 10.3%. The establishment of national parks commenced in 2003. At present, 3.72% of the country's territory lies in national parks. The establishment of the Gizilagaj Seaside National Park is in its initial stage. The feasibility study on the establishment of the Zaqatala-Balakan Biosphere Reserve has just finished. Upon the establishment of the National Park and Biosphere Reserve, the size of protected areas will constitute 12% of the country's total territory.</p><h4>What measures are being taken to promote the diversity of Azerbaijan's fauna?</h4><p>For the first time in the South Caucasus, a wildlife restoration and rehabilitation center has been established within the Gizilagaj National Park, and it has been provided with the latest medical and veterinarian equipment. Measures have also been taken to increase the population of rare and endangered biological species, to reintroduce them to their historical habitats, and to create sustainable populations. A project on reintroducing gazelles to their historical habitats began with support from the Heydar Aliyev Foundation in 2009. Up to 100 gazelles were resettled in three historical habitats in the project. Satellite and visual observations of the gazelles suggests that they have adapted well to their new habitats and registered natural growth. On December 24, 2010, President Ilham Aliyev and his wife Mehriban Aliyeva watched the process of releasing the first herd of gazelles—21 head—into one of their historical habitats near the Pirakushkul settlement of Absheron District. According to an order of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan dated December 26, 2008, work is currently under way to establish a modern zoological park in Azerbaijan.</p><div class="quote">“The country's correct socioeconomic development policies have brought it only success."</div><h4>What opportunities exist for mining in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>As a result of the research carried out by the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources in the area of geological exploration and prospecting, a total of 163 deposits have been identified in 25 regions of the country. These include, among ore mineral resources, two copper, three gold and silver, four loose-gold deposits, as well as 47 deposits of non-ore mineral resources, 105 of building materials, and two of subsurface water.</p><h4>How does the Ministry work to ensure that water pollution levels are kept to an acceptable standard?</h4><p>A system of sophisticated environmental monitoring based on advanced international experience and the latest technology has been put in place. In order to accurately analyze and assess environmental components, fully equipped research laboratories have been set up in different regions of the Republic, including those on cross-border rivers. As part of a technical cooperation program with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), a system of automatic controls over radiation levels has been created. There are a total of 28 laboratories with the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources dealing with the research of environmental components. In order to provide the population with clean drinking water in accordance with the orders of the President “on measures to improve the provision of the population with environmentally clean drinking water," water treatment plants have been installed in a total of 221 villages across 20 districts located along the Kura and Araz rivers. Around 400,000 residents of those villages were supplied with water meeting the requirements of the World Health Organization (WHO). In order to ensure the environmental protection of the Caspian Sea, “a system of the environmental protection of the Caspian Sea" has been developed for the first time in a Caspian littoral state. To this end, 17 biological modular treatment plants with a combined daily capacity of 6,400 cubic meters were installed in coastal areas. A pilot project is currently underway to establish a high-tech plant for the desalination of seawater and to create a modern seedling complex. A hazardous waste landfill has been created in order to ensure the effective management of hazardous waste. The approval of a program on the development of the hydrometeorology service in Azerbaijan by the President in 2004, and the measures taken to implement it, gave an impetus to the development of the hydrometeorology service in the country. According to an order by the President, in order to study climate change in the Bazarduzu-Shahdag-Tufandag area of the greater Caucasus, examine the dynamics of glaciers under the influence of climate change, and comprehensively study the ecosystem, an integrated hydrometeorology and environmental scientific research center was established. Automatic meteorological stations were installed on Mount Tufandag, and in Shahdag and Shahduzu, and their uninterrupted operation required the use of alternative energy.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the future?</h4><p>The country's correct socioeconomic development policies have brought it only success. It is worthy to note that the ongoing environmental activities are implemented according to state programs and action plans approved by President Ilham Aliyev, and are based on the principles of sustainable development. As a result of the successful implementation of socioeconomic development policies, the environmental situation in the country will continue to improve and the effective use of natural resources will be ensured.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[The Smelt of Success]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[the-smelt-of-success]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What projects are underway at Det.Al Holding?<br></h4><p>Det.Al Holding has several ongoing projects, one of which is the development of the Ganja Aluminum Smelter. We are planning to increase the capacity of our aluminum smelter from 50,000 tons a year to 100,000 tons during Phase II, as Phase I is already working at full capacity. We signed a construction agreement with a Chinese company and building began in 2012. Another project that we are working on is the construction of a semi-fabrication factory that will produce aluminum sheets. The capacity of the semi-fabrication factory will be 50,000 tons of aluminum sheets of different sizes per year, including 15,000 tons of painted sheets. The production from Phase II will be used to produce sheets in our semi-fabrication factory. We have worked hard in order to centralize our operations and have our aluminum smelter, alumina factory, and semi-fabrication factory in Ganja. Our semi-fabrication factory will be ready in 2013, and Phase II is expected to be completed by 2014.</p><h4>What is the outlook for your steel production?</h4><p>We have an iron ore company in Dashkesan. We are planning to increase our iron ore production by building a new factory, which will increase capacity to 2 million tons of concentrate per year. Det.Al Holding is also building an iron pelletization factory in Ganja. We are aiming to have built the iron ore factory, the concentrate factory, the 46-kilometer pipeline from Dashkesan to Ganja with a capacity of 3.5 million tons of iron ore concentrate, the pelletization factory, the hot briquetted iron (HBI) and direct reduced iron (DRI) factory, and the steel factory within five years. This will hopefully provide for a capacity of 2 million tons per year.</p><h4>How much of your production is exported?</h4><p>We export all of our capacity of iron ore concentrate to foreign countries through ports on the Black Sea. We sell part of our iron ore to customers in Georgia and Azerbaijan. From our region, 90% of the iron ore goes to China for steel production. In the metallurgy sector, different companies use iron ore for various reasons; some make a mix using magnesium, for example. We export a small quantity to Georgia for this reason. Regarding aluminum, we export 4,500 tons a month and we sell 400 or 500 tons on the local market. The rest is exported to the EU and Turkey. Local market demand will increase over the next few years, because we have information that an Azerbaijani industrial group is planning to open a new factory that will use our aluminum as its main raw material for producing goods, such as cables, construction materials, and equipment.</p><div class="quote">“We export all of our capacity of iron ore concentrate to foreign countries through ports on the Black Sea."</div><h4>How would you describe the current investment climate in Azerbaijan's mining industry?</h4><p>It is very attractive, especially for our factories outside of Baku. The government of Azerbaijan is giving increased attention to the possibilities and opportunities of increasing the economic and social wellbeing of all regions of the country, as well as in Baku. All of the infrastructure, such as water, gas, electricity, and roads are at a very developed level, so it is very attractive for foreign investors. In addition to this, the government is offering incentives to foreign investors through different regulations and laws. Some of these advantages are in taxation and customs regulations, as well as banking issues. This makes investment very easy and secure in Azerbaijan. The infrastructure in the region has also increased and is in excellent condition now. For example, the government spent more than ‚¬150 million on the electricity supply infrastructure for the construction of our smelter and steel factories, which is very important in metallurgy. For this reason, other companies working in the metallurgy sector want to build their factories close to ours. It is a sign that the government is actively helping the economy. It is making that area attractive for foreign investors. The economy, infrastructure, and government are all moving in the right direction for foreign investors. In general, the foreign investment climate in Azerbaijan is very attractive and it gets better every year.</p><h4>What needs to be done to attract more FDI into the mining industry?</h4><p>The Azerbaijani government is actively trying to increase non-oil FDI. It is increasing infrastructure development in the regions outside of Baku to help promote this. The government has a long-term program for increasing the economy and social wellbeing in different regions. For all regions in Azerbaijan, the government has approved different programs for development, and the majority of them are focused on increasing non-oil industrial activity. Azerbaijan exports a lot of gas, oil, and electricity, and as a producer of oil and gas products, the electricity here is cheaper than in other countries. Metallurgy relies on electricity and gas for production; approximately 40% of the cost of aluminum and steel production is electricity. When the government provides these advantages, it opens the way for other companies, agricultural centers, and factories that produce different goods for export and local requirements. The share of the non-oil industry in Azerbaijan's economy is increasing every year. Oil production here has reached a plateau and will decrease every year. President Ilham Aliyev made a speech about the development of the non-oil sector being a high priority. Due to this, we receive a great deal of support from the government for our work.</p><h4>What are your medium-term goals for Det.Al Holding over the next five years?</h4><p>Over the course of the next five years, we will have a new alumina factory with a capacity of 450,000 tons. We have developed a new technological process for the production of alumina from our alunite reserves in Azerbaijan, and it will make our product very profitable as the cost will decrease because we will not need to transport the raw material from abroad. The government supports us, and we are now working with different institutions from the US, Canada, Turkey, Russia, and China. We have 3 million tons of approved reserves, which is enough for the long term. Over the course of the next five years, we will also build a 200,000-ton capacity smelter and a semi-fabrication factory with a capacity of 50,000 tons. The capacity of our steel project will be 2 million tons of concentrate, 1.2 million tons of pellets, nearly 1 million tons of HBI/DRI, and approximately 800,000 tons of various steel products. In the next five years, Det.Al Holding will become the largest aluminum and steel producer in the country and the region.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What ideas led to the founding of Saloglu?</h4><p>The founding of Saloglu was based on the idea of Azerbaijan's economic development, in accordance with the program for the socioeconomic development of districts, which was proclaimed by President Ilham Aliyev.</p><h4>What percentage of your goods is exported?</h4><p>Currently, 25%-30% of our products are exported, and we expect that this ratio will increase in the coming years.</p><h4>How are you striving to improve the “Made in Azerbaijan" trademark abroad?</h4><p>The Azerbaijani brand has made a positive impact on our sales. First of all, the sale of locally manufactured goods in foreign markets is in itself a source of great pride. As I mentioned earlier, 25%-30% of our goods are exported. We have participated in various international exhibitions in order to improve the “Made in Azerbaijan" trademark abroad. We try to follow the latest trends emerging in foreign markets as well as apply the most recent technology, raw materials, and designs. In other words, we try to keep up with the times.</p><h4>What has been driving growth in the furniture business and will there be new growth areas in the future?</h4><p>The main factors of growth in the furniture business are the availability of large production site and the effective operation of process lines. If we add to this a prudent personnel policy, the business will be likely to succeed. Effective price management can also lead to growth. In the short-term, the key growth factors in the furniture business are maximum quality and minimized costs.</p><h4>What is the current capacity utilization of your plants?</h4><p>Our plants are currently operating at 50%-60% capacity.</p><h4>How would you rate Azerbaijan as a production base for furniture?</h4><p>Generally speaking, all of the conditions for production are available in Azerbaijan. Considering the fact that Azerbaijan has been independent for only 20 years, the current level and achievements of local producers are evidence of the attention and care on the part of the country's leadership.</p><h4>How would you describe the investment climate for the Azerbaijani manufacturing sector?</h4><p>As is the case with every sector, the positive results of the reforms carried out in Azerbaijan in recent years are apparent in manufacturing. Our entrepreneurs are not concerned about local and foreign investments being made in the national economy. The state has become a reliable guarantor for every business entity. The government has earned the confidence of all of our entrepreneurs. As a result of this, the investment environment in the country's manufacturing sector is very favorable.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the Azerbaijani economy in 2013?</h4><p>The Azerbaijani economy has been developing rapidly and consistently. Economic development programs, based on our national leader Heydar Aliyev's philosophy that “a country with a strong economy can achieve anything," are successfully carried on by his worthy successor, President Ilham Aliyev. This has strengthened the position of our country in all areas. The Azerbaijani economy will continue to grow and expand in 2013 because all the programs were carefully prepared and are being successfully implemented.</p><h4>What are the medium-term goals and growth objectives for Saloglu?</h4><p>The scope of activities in the furniture business is very broad. Our goals include entry into new areas of furniture production, increased exports, and a strengthened position in the domestic market. We are sure we can achieve these targets because the President of our country, who has managed to lead the country out of difficult times and create the present-day prosperity, will continue to support private-enterprise development in the years ahead. For our part, we at the Saloglu furniture company will do everything in our power to develop our country and statehood.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Does Azerbaijan's mining industry have an affect on world supply?<br></h4><p>The hard-rock mining industry in Azerbaijan is still in the early stages of development. At this time, there are two commercial-scale gold mines. The output from these two gold mines does not have a great impact on the global gold market, with production from these two relatively small mines being measured in tens of thousands of ounces of gold annually, as compared to all primary mine production of gold measured in several millions of gold ounces. However, in Azerbaijan, there was only one gold mine in early 2012, and now there are two. It is this business in Azerbaijan that is rapidly expanding as both of these mines have room for expansion and will increase production over time, and there is great potential for the additional discovery of nearby deposits. Many of the largest deposits elsewhere in the world have very similar geological settings as seen here in Azerbaijan; we just haven't found comparable quantities yet. However, that doesn't mean that the exploration potential is limited. On the contrary, we just have more work to do and it is only beginning. AIMROC is systematically reviewing the area immediately around Chovdar. The Chovdar license area is large, at 575 square kilometers. There are other gold showings in the area, and there is an iron deposit nearby, all of which contain clues needed to lead our exploration geologists to the next discovery, whether it be gold or other metals.</p><h4>What steps have you taken to help Azerbaijan take full advantage of its mineral potential?</h4><p>AIMROC has worked to raise basic awareness and encourage the government to support the mining industry, businesses that are required for our endeavors, and our company and its activities. While Chovdar is a relatively small mine, the capital requirements for building larger-scale mines could range much higher. Therefore, individual companies, such as AIMROC, need to have secure sources of capital, a clear and consistent regulatory framework, and well-defined risks to justify the size of investment needed in this business.</p><h4>How would you characterize the current investment climate in the mining sector in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>The investment climate in Azerbaijan is good for AIMROC as a company, and I believe that the future will see more investment. The people here at AIMROC are looking forward with great anticipation to future projects. We are establishing ourselves as an aggressive, results-oriented group, driven by the knowledge that we can succeed in Azerbaijan. It is unique for me as a professional to be employed in a situation where an idea or mining opportunity is presented that may have done very little mine development work before. In AIMROC's development pipeline, we are working in many new areas without any significant development works or previous operations. We as a company get strong encouragement from all levels of the government and the local communities where we operate to advance our projects quickly. AIMROC is secure in the knowledge that we can realize our opportunities with hard work and a diligent, professional approach to building mines.</p><h4>What are the medium-term plans for AIMROC?</h4><p>In the immediate to medium term, the company is striving to improve the performance at Chovdar. We built it, and part of the evolution of a mine is that once it is built it needs to be optimized to better respond to the conditions encountered and fine-tune all of the systems in place. The objective will also be to add value by potentially cutting costs, enhancing operating efficiencies, and making operations more effective. Chovdar, like any mine, will eventually run out of ore, and as time goes on we need to replace those reserves. We have greater possibilities now because the mine itself is operating. In the medium term, our focus will continue to be to enhance our portfolio of projects, while at the Chovdar mine we will grow our current operations, look for additional deposits, and expand into the deeper underground parts of the Chovdar ore body.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of Nobel Oil in Azerbaijan?<br></h4><p>Nobel Oil started its activity in Azerbaijan in 2005 as an engineering and services company. The company's main focus was in the oil and gas production services area, having entered the market offering services relating to the rehabilitation of old fields and work on oil wells. Later, we expanded our activities into integrated engineering services relating to rotating equipment, such as gas compressors, engines, and generators. We currently cover a full portfolio of services, starting from the design stage of greenfield facilities, the upgrading of brownfield operations with modern technology, operations and maintenance, overhaul, supervision, spare parts supply, and more. We have completed several ambitious projects, such as work on 72 offshore wells, as well as the installation and upgrade of gas compressor stations.</p><h4>Who are your main customers here?</h4><p>Nobel Oil is closely cooperating with the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR) and its production unions. Following demand from the energy sector in Azerbaijan, we are expanding our activities to catch up with the organic growth opportunities that are evolving in the region. Nobel Oil is building its competitive advantage around four business functions. The first function is called integrated energy services, and we continue to expand and develop our drilling operations and capabilities, work-over skills, operation and maintenance of oil and gas processing facilities, and oil and gas production facilitation services. Second is procurement and supply chain management. We aim to participate in various projects relating to the supply of goods and services, as well as long-term logistics supply projects in the region. The third function that is being formed is an engineering and project management function. With experience accumulated in the delivery of integrated services for rotating equipment, we have created the capabilities required to participate in various engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) projects as a turnkey contractor or local integrated sub-contractor to international general EPC contractors. The energy sector in Azerbaijan is booming and SOCAR leads these multibillion-dollar projects. Competition is very fierce, and we are actively working in order to become a qualified local partner for the big international players. Last but not the least is upstream. Together with SOCAR, we started exploration activities at the Umid field, where our affiliate has a 20% interest. The early production of gas and condensate that started at Umid has opened up a new era for Nobel Oil as an upstream player. We are proud that our contribution to the project in form of competence, know-how, as well as equipment and investment, made this happen. It was the first gas condensate field that was discovered since Azerbaijan obtained independence without the participation of “oil majors."</p><p>Production started on September 18, 2012 at a rate of 1.2 million cubic meters per day of gas and about 160 tons of condensate. Currently, gas is being supplied to the national grid network, and we are now discussing the action plan for full-field development with SOCAR in order to increase the production of this field drastically. The total reserves of this field are around 200 billion cubic meters, but we will continue the appraisal process and we believe this will increase further after the appraisal is finished.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the oil and gas sector in 2013?</h4><p>Overall, 2013 will be very challenging for us because we need to make adequate resource allocation to participate in a number of big projects to be implemented by SOCAR and BP in the region. We would like to participate in every project, but we must plan properly and mobilize our resources to successfully implement every project. One example includes a refinery project in Turkey, two fertilizer projects in Azerbaijan and Georgia, a gas-processing plant, and more. All these projects are large scale, so big players from all over the world are fighting to get them. As a local sub-contractor we could be of benefit to them and we have an appetite to be involved in every project. Again, it is a big challenge to get the project and there will be huge competition, not only among the companies, but also for the resources, because everyone will need to mobilize an adequate number of qualified engineers and skilled workers. I expect 2013 will be a very promising year for contractors and a difficult year from a competition perspective.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Since the Ganja Automobile Plant started production, what have been the facility's major milestones?</h4><p>The Ganja Automobile Plant started production in 2004 when an agreement with a plant manufacturing light cars in the Russian city of Naberezhnye Chelny was reached. We began by assembling VAZ-11113 Oka automobiles. It is very gratifying that most of these cars were distributed to those who are disabled as a result of the Karabakh War and veterans of World War II. Ganja Automobile Plant then signed an agreement with Russia's UAZ OJSC, and in May 2005 our plant launched the assembly of about 10 UAZ models. Moreover, our plant signed an agreement with China's Chang'an Automobile Group to assemble seven medium-duty automobile models, three of which were named “Ganja," marking the first use of our brand. The official visit of President Ilham Aliyev to the Republic of Belarus in 2006 began a new chapter in the history of our enterprise. According to an agreement reached between the Presidents of Azerbaijan and Belarus, the Ganja Automobile Plant, the Minsk Automobile Plant, and Minsk Tractor Works signed an agreement. Shortly afterward, a new process line was installed by specialists at the plant. Thus, the first Belarus-brand tractor was manufactured on March 27, 2007. One month later, we began building MAZ vehicles. As a result of the talks held during President Ilham Aliyev's visit to Belarus, the Ganja Automobile Plant Production Association, the Minsk Automobile Plant, and Minsk Tractor Works have continued cooperating. As part of this cooperation, our plant assembles various heavy-duty MAZ trucks and Belarus tractors. Since 2007, up to 4,000 Belarus tractors and 2,000 MAZ trucks have been manufactured at Ganja as a result of this partnership. These vehicles are currently used in various regions of Azerbaijan.</p><h4>What other projects has Ganja Automobile Plant initiated?</h4><p>Having adopted the motto “Step by step from smaller to bigger goals," our enterprise is now working on new projects and initiatives. For instance, a trilateral protocol on cooperation was signed with Germany's Haller and the Minsk Automobile Plant in March 2010 for the installation of Haller municipal service equipment designed for the chassis of MAZ automobiles. The Ganja Automobile Plant, the Minsk Automobile Plant, and Haller have reached an agreement for the assembly of 21-cubic-meter, modern equipment based on MAZ-6312A8 Euro-4 and Euro-5 chassis styles, which are adapted for conditions in Azerbaijan. To this end, an assembly workshop covering an area of 7,000 sqm and fitted with state-of-the-art process equipment, including a paint room, was set up at our enterprise. As planned, in June 2011 Ganja Automobile began the assembly of Haller municipal equipment. A total of 24 vehicles have been assembled to date, while 16 more are in the final stages of assembly. This is not all we do. Since 2010, our partnership with Belarusian companies BelAgroMash and DorElektroMash has been expanding. As a result, the Ganja Automobile Plant started manufacturing various suspended and trailing equipment for Belarus tractors. Our plant has manufactured a total of more than 300 crane trucks, municipal service vehicles, excavators, plows, and other agricultural machinery since October 2010.</p><h4>What level of recognition has this cooperation between Azerbaijani and Belarusian auto makers received?</h4><p>It is no coincidence that during their visits to Azerbaijan, the Prime Minister of Belarus, Mikhail Masnikovich, and the First Deputy Prime Minister and Co-Chairman of the Belarus-Azerbaijan intergovernmental commission on trade and economic cooperation, Vladimir Semashko, praised the work and projects carried out by the Ganja Automobile Plant. However, the best feedback of our work was given by President Ilham Aliyev during a cabinet meeting in August 2008 dedicated to the results of the country's socioeconomic development in the first six months of that year. On the topic of agricultural achievements, our Head of State said, “we have attached special importance to agricultural development in the last few years. We have taken practical measures and purchased equipment and machinery. There are no problems with the supply of machinery now and everything is available. We have actually started the production of agricultural machinery in Azerbaijan." Additionally, the Ganja Automobile Plant Production Association established a marketing and maintenance enterprise in Baku in April 2011, which deals with the sale and maintenance of the machinery manufactured by the plant. All the machinery manufactured by the Ganja Automobile Plant has a one-year warranty period, with effective and qualified after-sales service and maintenance organized in all regions of Azerbaijan. Our service centers also have mobile maintenance teams. The Ganja Automobile Plant is currently carrying out talks with Belarusian company Amkodor on the potential assembly of its products in Azerbaijan. We are also examining the prospects for the assembly of MAZ city and intercity buses in Ganja.</p><h4>What is your target market and how is business divided between cars, buses, and agricultural vehicles?</h4><p>Our main focus at the moment is to supply the domestic market with our vehicles. There is a great demand for heavy-duty trucks, tractors fitted with different equipment, specialized agricultural machinery, and municipal service and construction hardware in Azerbaijan. Of course, we are also working on ways to access foreign markets and sell our machinery outside of Azerbaijan. This is the objective of our marketing and maintenance enterprise. We regularly monitor the markets of neighboring countries and plan on setting up permanent representative offices in these countries.</p><h4>What have been the most significant changes to Azerbaijan's business landscape over the past few years?</h4><p>The development of business in any country boils down to the political and economic situation. Countries considered stable from political and economic points of view always attract investors. This process started in Azerbaijan back when national leader Heydar Aliyev returned to power. The signing of the “Contract of the Century" is a graphic example of that. In continuation of this work, President Ilham Aliyev has done a great deal to create a favorable business environment in Azerbaijan. Today, hundreds of foreign companies operate and invest in Azerbaijan, working alongside local business people on further developing the national economy and improving the wellbeing of the country's population. It is therefore no coincidence that in remarks at a meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers on the results of socioeconomic development in 1H2012 and future objectives, President Ilham Aliyev said, “Foreign investors have confidence in us. We have created wonderful conditions for foreign investors. The relationships between government officials and major companies are very positive. Foreign investors help us increase local production." Thus, Azerbaijan is ahead of most countries in terms of its business landscape. Suffice to say that the World Bank's 2013 Doing Business report ranks Azerbaijan 67th among 185 countries of the world in terms of its business environment. Azerbaijan is among the world leaders according to a number of indicators. All of this is clear evidence of the favorable conditions created by President Ilham Aliyev for the development of business.</p><h4>Looking forward to 2013, what are the main growth objectives for the Ganja Automobile Plant?</h4><p>In continuation of our ongoing projects, in 2013 we will carry on assembling various models of tractors and vehicles in accordance with our agreements. The assembly of other specialized vehicles is also expected. In addition, we plan to assemble vehicles for road construction, municipal service, snow removal, airfields, forestry, and the agricultural sector under the agreement with Amkodor Holding. The assembly of Haller municipal service vehicles for the MAZ chassis will also be continued in 2013. Furthermore, we plan to start the assembly of modern and comfortable MAZ-brand city and intercity buses. As far as the markets are concerned, our main goal is to find customers for our automobiles and tractors in Georgia, Turkey, and Central Asia.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the idea behind starting TAJ, and what strategy has guided your expansion and diversification?</h4><p>Today, 15 years after the establishment of the Aquavita brand, it is difficult to imagine the realities of the period that preceded the establishment of TAJ, and the creation of the flagship brand Aquavita. By early 1995, Azerbaijan was faced with the problem of a complete mismatch between the local consumer market and the needs of foreign experts who began to arrive in the country to implement the “Contract of the Century." At that time, Azerbaijan was simply unable to offer products consistent with Western standards, and the country faced the task of replacing the import of consumer goods in a short time. As a result, world-class hotels started to open in the country. Manufacturers of food and beverages meeting international standards also started emerging. In fact, two brands, Shollar and Aquavita, became pioneers in the drinking water market in Azerbaijan. It is significant that we entered the market in the year when the production of “early oil" started under the “Contract of the Century." Indeed, initially we operated within the framework of the policy of import substitution, which is still relevant in various segments of the food market. However, the market focus of Aquavita went beyond the expatriate community attracted by the country's oil boom. We have always known that the quality of life in Azerbaijan would grow in parallel with economic development, and table water will not just be a fashionable decoration but will enjoy real demand.</p><h4>How would you describe the FMCG market in Azerbaijan and how do you intend to place your products ahead of well-established multinational brands?</h4><p>It may seem surprising, but Aquavita is a brand as strong and recognizable in Azerbaijan today as Perrier is in the US and Europe. Today, the competition in Azerbaijan's table water market is perhaps stronger than outside the country. One or two aggressive brands appear almost every year and begin to fight with traditional suppliers for a place in the sun. An answer can only be provided through regular technological upgrades and the enhancement of the product range. Today, TAJ products are represented by the following brands: Aquavita, Gulustan, Three Stars, and Shahdag lemonade.</p><h4>What are your future expansion plans?</h4><p>TAJ and the entire economy are moving away from import substitution and toward exports. The sheer volume of the market forces us to do so. However, as owners of the Aquavita brand, we have no room for error. Therefore, we are obliged to offer foreign consumers not just an excellent product, which we already have, but something amazing that would win over even the most demanding customers. This objective requires not only correct marketing moves, but also a real breakthrough in improving the quality of products. In this regard, we have dedicated the last few years to the reconstruction of our production process on the basis of the world's best technologies. Collaborating with such global brands as Krones of Germany, we are technologically prepared for the export of quality products. By increasing the number of international certificates for our products in 2012 (ISO 2009), we have taken another step toward the European market. We are already involved in a series of talks as part of the research of foreign markets. Our focus is not only on the food markets of the CIS, Georgia, and the Baltic states that are traditional for Azerbaijani products, but also on the so-called “distant abroad." The potential markets include countries of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), where new opportunities are emerging after the Arab Spring. We started our work thanks to the wise policy of the national leader Heydar Aliyev, and we are still reaping its fruits. If it hadn't been for the “Contract of the Century," the Aquavita brand would not exist now. At the same time, we are very grateful to President Ilham Aliyev for his policy of opening Azerbaijani  products up to foreign markets.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the strategic decisions that led Coca-Cola to enter the Azerbaijani market?</h4><p>Coca-Cola entered Azerbaijan in 1994, right after the separation of Azerbaijan from the former Soviet Union, as a sales and distribution company. We started production in Baku two years later in 1996. Coca-Cola is one of the first and largest foreign investments in the non-oil sector. Azerbaijan is a dynamic, young, developing, and prosperous country and—as in rest of the world—Coca-Cola is part of everyday life, and Azerbaijan is no exception.</p><h4>How would you characterize the FMCG sector within the country?</h4><p>The FMCG sector here in Azerbaijan is developing every day and becoming more competitive and advanced, which is not very different from the FMCG sector in other countries.</p><p>Azerbaijani consumers demand the best products and the best services available at the highest standards. There are many companies operating in this sector, meaning we need to be able to meet the high standards set by our consumers. The companies that are the fastest not the biggest will win in this marketplace.</p><div class="quote">“In 2012, Azerbaijan very successfully organized large international events."</div><h4>How would you describe Coca-Cola's competitive advantage in relation to other drink manufacturers here in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>As Coca-Cola Azerbaijan, offering the best quality products is our top business objective, and our production quality adheres to the highest world standards.</p><p>In 2012, I was very honored to represent my company, and I felt extremely proud that Azerbaijan Coca-Cola was recognized as one of the leaders in quality in the Coca-Cola system. Coca-Cola Azerbaijan was nominated for the President's Sustainability Awards Grand Prize (Best Country Bottling Operation) organized by The Coca-Cola Company Eurasia and Africa Group.</p><p>Azerbaijan Coca-Cola was selected as one of the top-10 nationwide performing plants from among 260 plants in 90 countries by an international jury that assesses the performance of bottling operations in the fields of environmental and quality performance, as well as overall contributions made to local communities.</p><h4>What is the current market share of Coca-Cola beverages in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>We track our market share on a monthly basis from a third-party independent agency and our current market share is around 60%. We have products in five beverage segments in the total Non-Alcoholic Ready to Drink (NARTD) segment, and we are either number one or number two in all the segments we have products.</p><h4>How important are your Azerbaijani operations as a proportion of your regional operations?</h4><p>The Azerbaijan Coca-Cola Bottling operation is part of a regional bottler, Coca-Cola İçecek, which is based in Istanbul. It operates in 10 countries, which makes it the sixth largest bottler in the Coca-Cola System. Azerbaijan is the fourth largest operation in Coca-Cola İçecek's portfolio, and it is one of the most important markets both from an innovation and execution in market standpoint.</p><p>Azerbaijan is a leader, right after Turkey, in introducing new investments, technologies, and applications within Coca-Cola İçecek. Azerbaijan was the first country in the Caucasus and Central Asian Region (CCAR) to introduce Coca-Cola Zero. Also, Dushes is a local Azerbaijan pear type, which we developed into a Fanta Dushes flavor that is unique to Azerbaijan.</p><h4>How would you assess the current investment climate within Azerbaijan?</h4><p>The Azerbaijani government is promoting new investments in the country by passing new laws and legislation to help increase FDI. Furthermore, these revisions and updates are introduced by the Parliament to help existing businesses in Azerbaijan be an integral part of the world economy in order to be able compete in a free market economy. Not only the Azerbaijan private sector, but government agencies and organizations are becoming an integral part of their counterparts around the world.</p><h4>What have been some of the major changes you have seen over the past decade?</h4><p>Azerbaijan is developing very rapidly, and it is doing it in an organized and systematic way. The development is happening in all regions of Azerbaijan, as well as in the public and private sectors, law and legislation, infrastructure, economy, and government spending abroad.</p><p>In 2012 alone, Azerbaijan very successfully organized large international events, such as the Eurovision Song Contest and the Women's U-17 Football Championship. This is a clear indication that there is well-deserved worldwide respect for Azerbaijan.</p><h4>What are the long-term plans for Coca-Cola here in Azerbaijan</h4><p>In 2011, we set a 10-year long-term goal that we call Vision 2020. In 2014, Azerbaijan Coca-Cola will celebrate its 20th year in Azerbaijan. So far we have invested around $120 million. Over the last three years we have spent more than $40 million, and we have plans to operate and invest in Azerbaijan for many years to come.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of Total in Azerbaijan?<br></h4><p>We have had over 15 years of history with some unfortunate trials as well as some successful ventures. It started with entry into the Shah Deniz gas field. There was also an exploration project, on the Lankaran-Talish-Deniz block, operated by ELF, one of the companies now a part of Total, as well as a former partnership with Chevron on the Absheron block. Both Absheron and Lankaran-Talish-Deniz turned out to be considered dry in the beginning, so we relinquished them. Shah Deniz turned into a success and we are still there. We continued studying the Absheron block and we recently took it on again. This time we partnered with SOCAR, and in September 2011 we made a successful discovery. We believe there are around 5 trillion-10 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of potential reserves there.</p><h4>What sort of working relationship do you have with your partners?</h4><p>The relationship is a normal working partnership. SOCAR has 40%, Total has 40%, and GDF Suez has 20%. The next step will be to create an operating company for future development. This means that an entity made out of Total, SOCAR, and potentially GDF Suez will be in charge of the development and production activities as soon as the development program is agreed upon with SOCAR. It will be a closer relationship because we will have a common entity to work through.</p><h4>What is Total's role in the development of the Shah Deniz field?</h4><p>Total has a 10% stake in the Shah Deniz field. We aim to be a constructive partner that tries to bring our experience to the project and provide some of our know-how while working with the operator to propose improvements where we see possible. At the moment, in Phase I, we are producing something between 800 million and 900 million standard cubic feet (scf) per day. In Phase II, this is expected to increase by an additional 16 billion cubic meters (bcm) per year comprised of 6 bcm going to Turkey and 10 bcm going to the EU. Most of our activities in Shah Deniz at the moment are concentrated on Phase II development.</p><div class="quote">“We aim to be a constructive partner that tries to bring our experience to the project."</div><h4>How important are Total's Azerbaijani operations for the Total Group?</h4><p>It terms of production, it is not that important because our equity production here is about 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent (boe) per day this year, whereas the total equity production of Total worldwide is close to 2.4 million boe per day. We project that this proportion will increase significantly when Phase II of Shah Deniz comes on stream and later when Absheron begins to produce. There are also further opportunities in Azerbaijan, such as offshore exploration, which we can contribute to and would be ready to work on if SOCAR is interested.</p><h4>What is the role of Total in the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) and South Caucasus Pipeline (SCP) projects?</h4><p>We have a small equity role of 5% in BTC and 10% in SCP, so we don't have a major influence. BTC is of interest for us to export our liquid production from Shah Deniz and eventually from Absheron. It is also of interest because we will begin production in Kazakhstan, and we may ship some of that production through BTC one day. Regarding the SCP, it is linked to our role in Shah Deniz because we use it to export the gas from the field. It may be an export solution in the future for the gas production of Absheron. It is an asset that has significance for us. At the moment, the capacities of those pipelines are matched to Shah Deniz output, which is about 8 bcm per annum, at the moment, and 24 bcm once Phase II is completed. SCP is also the first link to the Trans-Anatolia Pipeline (TANAP) then to the South East Corridor onto Europe.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main focuses of Schlumberger's operations in Azerbaijan?<br></h4><p>Our customers in Azerbaijan include the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR), BP, and Total, as well as a number of independent operators that have contracts to rejuvenate existing fields and explore for new reserves. Schlumberger provides technology, information solutions, and integrated project management for its customers to explore, develop, and produce their oil and gas fields. We are providing our services at many of the country's oil and gas fields, including Azer-Chirag-Guneshli (ACG), Shah Deniz, and Umid.</p><h4>What strategy led to Schlumberger's decision to enter the Azerbaijani market?</h4><p>Schlumberger actually first worked in Azerbaijan back in the 1930s. With the signing of the “Contract of Century" it was clear there would be a significant opportunity for the company's technology and expertise to develop the ACG oilfield, and so the company was delighted to restart continuous operations in Baku.</p><h4>How much has Schlumberger invested in operations in the area?</h4><p>The most important investment that Schlumberger has made in Azerbaijan has been in hiring and training engineers from Azerbaijan to perform services onshore and offshore. Today, Schlumberger employees from Azerbaijan can be found not only working at Azerbaijani oil and gas fields, but also in major oilfields in the world.</p><h4>What does R&amp;D mean for Schlumberger?</h4><p>An important value of Schlumberger is our steadfast commitment to technology and quality—this is the basis for our competitive advantage. Consistent with this value is our commitment to providing services that enhance and optimize our customers' performance. R&amp;D is essential if we are to meet this commitment. Schlumberger has over 25 R&amp;D facilities worldwide, with an emphasis on developing innovative technology that adds value for our customers. In 2011, for example, we invested $1.1 billion in R&amp;D. The reality of bringing hydrocarbons to market today is that the technical challenges are increasing all the time. As it is sometimes said, “the easy oil is gone." That makes it an ever-increasing requirement to apply technology to meet the challenges that today's oilfields present.</p><h4>In terms of the working environment, when you compare Azerbaijan to your previous experience, how do you feel about operating here?</h4><p>I've been fortunate to work in some very interesting places in my career from the Empty Quarter in Saudi Arabia, to the North Sea, to the foothills of the Rocky Mountains in Canada. My latest assignment in Azerbaijan is no exception. From a technical perspective, the work can be very challenging with deeply buried, high-pressure reservoirs and challenging formations to drill through. The history of the country, and the oil fields here in particular, also make it a very rich and stimulating environment in which to work.</p><h4>How do you deal with issues of hiring skilled local personnel?</h4><p>Part of our corporate profile is to hire people in every country where we work. We look for people with good educational backgrounds and then provide them with technical training through our company's training centers to ensure they are competent enough to perform services for our customers. The level of training the company provides is one of the unique benefits of working for Schlumberger. We have four major learning centers in Houston, Paris, Tyumen, and Abu Dhabi. These centers are even equipped with drilling rigs so we can provide our engineers with real hands-on training. Once the employees return from these learning centers they follow a structured program to enable them to continue developing their skills.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the energy sector?</h4><p>According to industry forecasts, the future for the sector is continued growth. There is ongoing work to maximize production from the existing fields, and there are new discoveries yet to be fully developed. The new subsea developments are particularly exciting and require a new set of technical solutions. The plans to add drilling rig capacity in the country are a good indicator of the confidence we have going forward. We are fully committed to supporting our customers here in Azerbaijan. I am looking forward to continuing to bring innovative technology here to maximize success.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What ideas led to the founding of Embawood?</h4><p>Due to the socioeconomic changes that occurred in Azerbaijan in 1993 and the favorable environment for entrepreneurs that arose, our interest to invest in the furniture sector increased. Since there was market demand and conditions were favorable for the furniture business, we decided to found Embawood. Of course, if we remember those times now, it was very interesting, but starting up this type of business was also very challenging. We couldn't fully observe the market, and we couldn't determine the features Azerbaijani consumers were looking for in furniture. Despite that, we decided to apply the principle of introducing quality furniture with affordable prices in the market, and the current results show that we made the right decision.</p><h4>What strategy has guided your expansion and diversification?</h4><p>Our goal is to present quality and diverse local products to our nation. We observe global trends and attend exhibitions in developed countries to bring innovations to Azerbaijan. We built our strategy based on demand and our goals, and, most importantly, we didn't apply global trends directly to our products, but modified them according to the taste and mentality of Azerbaijani consumers. I think our leadership is not only due to our business cycle, but also due to the relationship we have with our clients.</p><h4>What percentage of your goods are exports, and do you expect to increase your export potential?</h4><p>Approximately 20% of our products are exported. This figure is going to increase in the future, and we are currently working in that direction. We represent not only our furniture in foreign markets, but also the philosophy and modern lifestyle of Azerbaijani families. We produce furniture in our factories, but we serve happiness to our clients. The mission of our company is based on this idea.</p><div class="quote">“We observe global trends and we attend exhibitions in developed countries to bring innovations to Azerbaijan."</div><h4>How are you striving to improve the “Made in Azerbaijan" trademark abroad?</h4><p>First of all, I would like to mention that I am proud of producing and exporting Azerbaijani products. Compared to previous years, this has become much easier. Certainly, the fact that Azerbaijan is not the main furniture exporter in the international market creates some difficulties for us; however, Embawood is already known as an Azerbaijani producer in international markets.</p><h4>What has been driving growth in the furniture business, and will there be new growth areas in the future?</h4><p>The socioeconomic development in Azerbaijan has increased the demand for new products. We are trying to increase our production, and we are continuously investing to improve the quality of our goods. We will be working in that direction for the foreseeable future. Our company is developing along with the socioeconomic conditions of Azerbaijan.</p><h4>What is the current capacity utilization of your plants?</h4><p>Unlike other fields, there is a high impact of seasonal cycles in the furniture field. During high sales seasons, we enjoy 100% utilization of our production capacities. We are currently working on increasing our production volume and mechanizing most of our production process.</p><h4>How would you rate Azerbaijan as a production base for furniture?</h4><p>Despite the lack of necessary raw materials for furniture production in Azerbaijan, we still became successful. This means that it is possible. Although modern businesses are based on production technologies, this doesn't mean client demands should be undermined. We are producing the goods that our clients are demanding. The furniture field in Azerbaijan is approaching the level of developed countries. Additionally, customer demand in Azerbaijan is huge. The market is big for those entrepreneurs who want to produce goods that are in demand, and there is a favorable environment for investment. Over the medium term our plan is to increase the quality of our services and products, to follow global trends, and to increase the impact of our brand.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of Inter Glass in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Inter Glass was launched in December 2008 at a ceremony that was attended by President Ilham Aliyev.</p><h4>How would you describe the current operations of Inter Glass in Azerbaijan, and what is its size in terms of regional competition?</h4><p>At present, the Inter Glass plant is one of the largest glass-producing companies in the Caucasus region. The company operates specialized modern equipment manufactured in Europe. The enterprise has two production lines, and each of them has a capacity ranging from 100,000 to 120,000 glass containers, while the total production capacity of the enterprise is 80 million-85 million units of glass a year. To date, the company has developed and produced more than 70 types of bottles.</p><h4>What strategies have allowed Inter Glass to become the market leader in the Caucasus region?</h4><p>We have mastered the technology of manufacturing lightweight glass containers, which is considered an innovation and is used only by leading specialized factories. By using state-of-the-art equipment, we have succeeded in reducing the weight of glass containers. For example, the weight of a regular half-liter bottle has dropped from 340-350 grams to 280-285 grams. This is a great advantage for both the beverage industry and for customers. Due to the smaller weight of glass containers and their durability, the cost of transporting  the finished products is reduced, which has a positive effect on the price. At present, our products are in demand in neighboring Georgia and Russia. Representatives of the world-famous Georgian mineral water Borjomi purchased 3 million glass containers from the company in 2011-2012. This year, we plan to increase that figure to about 10 million-15 million units.</p><div class="quote">“At present, our products are in demand in neighboring Georgia and Russia."</div><h4>What are the medium-term plans of your company?</h4><p>Our main goal today is to provide consumers with quality glass containers. Furthermore, we intend to expand our production, start developing technologies to manufacture containers of colored glass on separate production lines, and to apply silkscreen paint, which will lend the finished product a nice decorative effect. There is a need for that. In the future, we will be able to fully meet the needs of domestic customers in this segment.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>In the middle of the 1850s Ludvig Nobel, elder brother to the world famous inventor and creator of the Nobel Prize, Alfred Nobel, established a mechanical factory in St Petersburg producing grenades with a new technology. He later followed this with cannons, rifles, and gun carriages. The company was soon to become one of the largest suppliers to the Russian army and the beginning of a tremendous success story, which would be largely unknown to most people outside Russia and Azerbaijan. Working together with Ludvig was his older brother Robert. He was sent to the Caucasus region on a mission to find walnut wood for rifle stocks to fill an order of 200,000 rifles for the Russian army. Arriving in Baku, he discovered that oil was literally bubbling out of the ground, and he realized that there was a great opportunity in the oil business. He returned to St Petersburg and managed to convince Ludvig to invest in Baku. In 1875, the first Nobel refinery was inaugurated under the name Bra Nobel. Alfred was also called upon to invest in the company, which he did. They could never have realized at the time that by 1917 Bra Nobel would be the second largest oil company in the world.</p><p>The Russian revolution abruptly ended the almost 80-year-long success story of the Nobel family in Azerbaijan and Russia. Ludvig, being a scientist, inventor, and entrepreneur as well as a businessman, quickly saw the potential in this new business as well as its problems. One major problem that he could identify was logistics. At that time, oil was transported in leather sacks or wooden barrels by camels and donkeys—not a very efficient means of transportation. He, therefore, designed and built the first oil tanker, the Zoroaster, the first in a fleet of 40 oil tankers. He laid the first pipeline in Azerbaijan to Russia, built special railway wagons for oil, introduced steam engines in the oil fields, built the first depots for oil and kerosene in Russia, introduced the first electrical plant in the Caucasus, and pioneered new modern drilling technics. Bra Nobel became one of the first fully vertically integrated companies in the world.</p><p>Another important success factor was his sense of corporate responsibility. As a visionary leader, Ludvig improved the conditions of his workers by shortening working hours and building schools, housing, healthcare, and recreational facilities. He opened a cooperative bank and introduced a pension system. Overall, 40% of the company's profit was returned back to its employees. Sustainability and social commitment became the trademarks of Nobel industries. After his death in 1888, his oldest son, Emanuel, continued in the same spirit and developed the company even further up to the very end of its existence. It must also be mentioned that without the efforts of Emmanuel there would probably not have been any Nobel Prize. He insisted that Alfred's last will should be respected, and bought all of his shares in Bra Nobel.</p><p>The Russian revolution in 1917 changed the scene dramatically. All of the Nobel industries and properties were confiscated by the new regime. The family was forced to flee the country under dramatic circumstances and leave everything behind. With the help of loyal employees they managed to return to Sweden, safe but empty handed. Today in Azerbaijan, almost 100 years later, the Nobel name is highly respected and the ordinance set by Ludvig for Bra Nobel lives on in the oil business.</p><p>The Nobel heritage has been restored today thanks to the Baku Nobel Heritage Fund (BNHF), founded by Dr Togrul Bagirov. In 2008, the old family residence in Villa Petrolea, Baku, was inaugurated after a total restoration, funded by BNHF. Many members of the Nobel family participated in the inauguration. The villa is today a Nobel museum as well as a place for receptions, weddings, and other events, as well as hosting the Baku Nobel Oil Club (BNOC) with members like SOCAR, BP, and Statoil. Members of the family frequently return to a rapidly changing Baku and Villa Petrolea, both for social and business activities. One such activity is the digitalization of the old archives of Bra Nobel by the National Board of Archives, the Centre for Business History in Stockholm (CBHS), and BNHF in cooperation with the Nobel Family Society. The Nobel Sustainability Trust is a family initiative aiming to crystalize and extend global awareness and focus on environmental considerations and solutions to ensure access to energy for all members of society whilst ensuring the protection of the earth. The work of the trust is in the spirit of Ludvig, and its main pillars are the Sustainability Award, the Sustainable Energy Conference, and the Nobel Sustainability Fund. Over the last three years, the Trust has participated in the Caspian Oil and Gas Conference as a keynote speaker stressing the need for renewable and sustainable energy to replace fossil fuels. In a cradle-to-cradle perspective, the Trust is also working on the establishment of a science park for clean technology in Baku. This project is well in line with the mega project, initiated by President Ilham Aliyev, transforming Baku from the “Black City" to the “White City."</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Stability Is Key]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[stability-is-key]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main policies the Central Bank of Azerbaijan (CBAR) expects to implement in 2013?<br></h4><p>The key directions of the monetary and financial stability policy for 2013 were formulated based on the results of the previous year, the expectations and forecasts of the market, global risks, and new growth challenges faced by the national economy. Doubling GDP and economic diversification are the key strategic goals for the national economy over the next decade. Being guided by these goals, the CBAR will ensure macroeconomic support to preserve the international competitiveness of the economy by maintaining a low level of inflation. In 2013, the key target is to hit a low single-digit inflation rate of 5%-6%, the core factor of which is determined by exchange rate stability. A stable and favorable exchange rate is one of the prerequisites for economic growth, diversification, and the competitiveness of non-oil exports. New strategic goals shape specific objectives in the development of financial intermediation. Supporting the diversification of the economy requires an ongoing new configuration in the performance of the financial banking sector and a dramatic increase in the financial, technological, and institutional capacity of the sector. The banking sector should also become more sustainable financially and reach a new level of development. The expansion of the regional network of non-bank credit institutions, credit unions, and e-payments, as well as the development of rural banking and postal-banking systems, will all be crucial for the growth policy of financial infrastructure. In addition to this, improving the amplification of the mortgage system, providing more favorable terms and conditions for mortgage lending, and increasing the scale of social mortgages will contribute to improving the housing conditions of the population. Hitting all of these objectives will create conditions to boost economic and business activities in the economy and ensure the more effective implementation of social programs, especially in regional and rural areas. In this context, 2013 will be the starting point of new qualitative changes in the banking industry for completing the restructuration and consolidation process, improving the financial stability management framework, expanding access to finance, and enhancing the institutional development of the banks.</p><h4>The banking sector will witness new prudential measures come into place in January 2014. What caused these decisions to be taken?</h4><p>Maintaining the stability and financial soundness of banks is one of the key tasks of CBAR. The capital requirement for banks is being risen five fold to AZN50 million. CBAR strives to provide a safe capitalization process for all stakeholders without triggering additional risks to financial stability. Banks owning 89% of banking sector assets already comply with this requirement. The deadline for the banks to comply with the new capital requirement is January 1, 2014. The structure of bank capital will also be improved. To note, consolidation of the banking sector has always been a focus during economic reforms. In the first years of transition to a market economy, over 250 banks with very low capital were functioning in the country. Deep consolidation resulted in a six to seven fold reduction in the number—only the soundest banks remained in the system. The process is still under way. Consolidation will allow for the deeper capitalization of banks, increase their resilience to risks, encourage a more efficient organization of the banking business, and provide the flexibility to meet the demand of the economy for funds. A new generation of banking regulations was adopted in 2004, and a solid platform formed to apply corporate governance standards. However, as the banks become larger, business processes become more complicated, and the formation of advanced management systems is needed. Upgrading risk management practices in the banks is a crucial task. The implied changes and new requirements are based upon the recent recommendations from the Basel Committee. One of the key tasks is to improve the protection and rights of financial services consumers. CBAR is planning to develop relevant legislation and standardize advanced implementation frameworks to that end.</p><h4>How would you characterize the changes that have occurred in Azerbaijan's economy over the last decade?</h4><p>Over the past 10 years, Azerbaijan has entered the group of medium-income countries. The scale of per-capita GDP in purchasing-power parity (PPP) exceeds $10,000 by this indicator. The baseline period of transition to a market economy is over. The smart use of oil revenues has allowed us to radically reduce the poverty rate, modernize social infrastructure, and considerably improve the welfare of the people—economic growth has become more inclusive. Azerbaijan is one of the top-20 countries with the lowest poverty rate. High economic growth rates have also been followed by a rising resilience to external shocks. From 2003 to 2012, the foreign exchange reserves in the country increased by 29 times. The strategic reserves now approximate to 70% of GDP, and it is among the top-15 countries in terms of this ratio. Reserves are sufficient to finance three years of imports and exceed external debt by nine times. The international rating of the country also improved. Even during the global crisis, Azerbaijan's ratings were upgraded. Azerbaijan was announced a champion of economic reforms in the Doing Business report in 2009. Fitch, Standard &amp; Poor's, and Moody's upgraded the country's ratings to investment grade in 2010. These economic achievements led us to set new growth and development targets.</p><h4>What is your forecast for the domestic economy over the coming year?</h4><p>In 2013, the global processes and world prices for the main export commodities are expected to have a positive effect on Azerbaijan's balance of payments. At the same time, non-raw commodities and service export growth expectations are also high. These factors may drive the current account surplus up to 20% of GDP to provide further growth for our strategic foreign exchange reserves. According to official forecasts, in 2013 economic growth is expected to be 5.3%, including 11.7% growth in the non-oil sector. International institutions also predict ongoing economic growth in the country. The non-oil sector will be a key driver of economic growth. Overall, Azerbaijan has an adequate strategy to neutralize risks coming from the global economic environment and meet the challenge of domestic development.</p><h4>What are the medium-term plans of CBAR?</h4><p>The key targets of the economic growth strategy of our country for 2020 are to further double national income and enter the group of high-income countries. CBAR is determined to actively contribute to these targets with its policy experience, creative staff, and intellectual leadership potential. Maintaining macroeconomic and financial stability while contributing to economic development are key strategic tasks for CBAR. To that end, the bank's 2011—2014 Strategic Plan implies significant changes in a number of directions. The fundamental modernization of key activities and meeting best international practices is the number one priority. It includes a substantial improvement of monetary management and the prudential supervision framework, enhancing cash circulation, and improving external communications using the most up-to-date standards. Another priority is the alignment of institutional governance systems by having the bank catch up with other leading central banks in terms of organizational maturity, development of the internal corporate environment, and performance management, as well as the improvement of human resources and risk management systems. The active contribution to economic growth is also an important task. We are determined to actively support the government in the implementation of the new economic strategy. Finally, we aim to develop human capital in the bank by tailoring the fundamental knowledge, skills, and qualifications of staff to the dynamic environment of the bank. Hence, in the medium term, CBAR is planning to implement about 40 new development projects. Hopefully, the coming strategic period will become a key stage to reinforce the idea of the “21st Century Central Bank" for CBAR.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Azerbaijan is one of the fastest-developing economies in the region. What makes the country so interesting for foreign investors?<br></h4><p>Attracting foreign investment to the national economy is an integral part of the economic development strategy of Azerbaijan. What makes our country particularly interesting for FDI is the open-door policy undertaken by the government toward foreign investors. The country enjoys political stability and legal guarantees are in place to protect investments. Azerbaijan possesses rich natural resources, minerals, and fertile lands. Our advantageous strategic location provides direct access to Central Asia and the Caspian basin region, thus enabling our participation in international trade initiatives such as the Silk Route and the North-South Transport Corridor. EU enlargement is also in our national interests, and, therefore, Azerbaijan actively participates in the EU's regional programs, including the Eastern Partnership. Additionally, we have competitive local manpower in the country. We have passed important laws and regulations with regard to the protection of the rights and interests of investors. Property rights, equal opportunities for both local and foreign entrepreneurs, and the free repatriation of profits, as well as laws on investment activities and the protection of foreign investment are crucial. The government has signed agreements on the avoidance of double taxation, and on the encouragement and reciprocal protection of investments with many countries. Our economic potential and advantageous geographical location foster the interest of foreign investors who seek to make long-term investments in Azerbaijan's economy. The share of foreign investments constitutes more than half of the nearly $120 billion invested in our economy over the last 17 years. This makes Azerbaijan the country with the highest FDI index per capita in the region. Nowadays, Azerbaijan accounts for 70% of the economy of the South Caucasus. Our economy is rapidly integrating into the global economy, and the country is wholly open to the import of high technology.</p><h4>Your Ministry has made several achievements in introducing modern management techniques. What can you tell us about your relationship with the other tax administrations in Europe?</h4><p>We are striving to establish a highly competitive, investment-attractive, simple, but still transparent and stable taxation system in Azerbaijan. Over the last 10 years, we have achieved significant progress in reducing the tax rate, modernizing the tax management system, and enhancing and applying new information technologies. This has helped us build effective control mechanisms as well as a flexible taxation system capable of coping with the changing and rapidly growing volume of the economy. We also make use of the experience of developed European countries in our tax system reforms. Our Ministry is an active member of the Intra-European Organization of Tax Administrations (IOTA), and we have established good relations with the OECD Center for Tax Administration. The cooperation we have undertaken with the World Bank and the EU in various projects also contributes to the modernization of our tax system. In 2012, we started establishing cooperation with the International Anti-Corruption Academy, and we're looking forward to deepening our relations. Moreover, we closely cooperate with the tax administrations of leading countries, particularly those in Europe. We have signed agreements on the avoidance of double taxation with 43 countries, as well as agreements on mutual assistance with several countries. The Ministry of Taxes has been successfully implementing the European Neighborhood Policy Action Plan for a while now. We are constantly reforming our tax laws and regulations in order to harmonize them with European standards. Our country's tax policy provides a good basis for undertaking an efficient and competitive economic policy in the region. Azerbaijan's taxation service can be compared to our European counterparts, both in terms of management systems and level of digitalization. The process of harmonizing our national legislation with European legislation is well underway. Azerbaijan was the first country in the CIS to achieve remarkable success in areas such as the digitalization of the tax administration and the introduction of taxpayer services. There are certainly several areas such as e-auditing, the taxation of e-commerce, and transfer pricing that are new for our country. Therefore, these areas are high on our reform agenda. In the medium term, we are working on the advancement of an IT-based tax administration, the improvement of the Ministry of Taxes' management system, and the establishment of a long-term strategy based on international experience and global standards. This strategy will cover the provision of a vast range of electronic services, the improvement of IT, and knowledge-based tax administration management, ensuring transparency and high efficiency.</p><h4>The Tax Administration is the most advanced state agency in Azerbaijan to apply IT. What has been the impact of the application of modern technology?</h4><p>The development of ICT is one of the key factors that define the level of development of a country. The government of Azerbaijan has set a strategic goal to extensively use ICT tools in all spheres of society, including public management. The establishment of e-government constitutes a fundamental part of endeavors undertaken in this regard, which are reflected in a specific state program. Serious steps are being made in the country to achieve an efficient e-government system and to integrate ICT tools into the management of state agencies. The establishment of e-government has entered an active phase in Azerbaijan. The provided e-services help to increase transparency in the activities of state agencies, reduce their direct contact with citizens and potential corruption cases, and improve citizen trust in state agencies. For the first time in Azerbaijan, a VAT deposit account was introduced enabling the full digitalization of tax controls in the VAT administration process. The application of the single VAT deposit account has prevented VAT evasion as well as reduced the administrative load on taxpayers. The one-stop shop for the registration of commercial legal entities is an integral part of our electronic services, and receives much praise from taxpayers and international organizations alike. The electronic registration of physical persons engaged in entrepreneurial activities was first introduced on July 1, 2011, followed by the registration of legal entities with domestic investments in February 2012. Meanwhile, the registration process of cash registers was applied to the cash payment process in Azerbaijan. As a whole, this technology considerably reduced costs for the tax administration. According to information from IOTA, as of late 2011, the taxation service of Azerbaijan was the most efficient tax administration in Europe and the post-Soviet region in terms of the proportion of tax administration costs to income from taxes, at 0.35%. At present, all processes related to entrepreneurial activities between the tax administration and taxpayers are largely digitalized. Entrepreneurs can simply pay their taxes on the internet, meaning they do not encounter any bureaucratic problems and transparency is assured. This all leads to time savings and cost reductions. Suffice to say, the Ministry of Taxes is the leading government agency in providing the most e-services under the “electronic government" policy in our country.</p><div class="quote">“The government of Azerbaijan has set a strategic goal to extensively use ICT tools in all spheres of society, including public management."</div><h4>In the World Bank's Doing Business report, Azerbaijan's tax system was described as an area with positive dynamics. Is this a green light for investors?</h4><p>The role of Azerbaijan in providing global energy security is steadily growing. The increase in oil revenues leads to an increase in the capabilities of our country in the geopolitical arena. On the other hand, it has positive impacts on the development of the non-oil sector in Azerbaijan. I would like to stress the fact that the development of the non-oil sector is the main priority direction of our state policy. Azerbaijan is striving to achieve the overall development of the country, establish a diversified economy, reduce the dependence of state income on the oil sector in the future, and increase non-oil revenues by efficiently using energy resources to invest in the non-oil sector. In the coming years, the main targets of the government's economic policy include deepening the diversification policy in the non-oil sector, raising the competitiveness of the economy, improving its structure and levels of foreign trade, reforming investment policy while developing infrastructure and innovation activities, and ensuring the development of human capital. As a key factor affecting the business environment, the number of taxes have decreased, and rates on major types of taxes are nowadays lower than the European average. Entrepreneurs involved in the agricultural production sector have been exempt from all taxes except the land tax. This foundation aims to enhance Azerbaijan's non-oil export capacity as well as attract foreign investment.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the most significant foreign policy achievements of 2012?<br></h4><p>Azerbaijan took its seat at the UN Security Council in early January 2012 for the very first time in its history and chaired the Council during May 2012. This is a very significant achievement for a country that has come a long way from the brink of total political and economic collapse in the early 1990s. To put it into context, Azerbaijan is the first country to have been elected as a UN Security Council non-permanent member in the whole South Caucasus and Central Asian region, and only the second in the CIS region. As President Ilham Aliyev said during his address to the Security Council, “Azerbaijan will always support international law and justice," and this role has allowed us to put into practice our long-standing commitment to the fundamental principles of international law as well as the existing international system. We have actively contributed to discussions on international issues ranging from terrorism and crisis to environmental protection. It goes without saying that alongside the prestige and influence it brings, our seat on the Security Council also puts heavy responsibilities on our shoulders to contribute to ensuring peace, stability, and prosperity for the whole world. I would also like to underline that Baku has been in the spotlight as it has successfully hosted a range of regional and international gatherings, including the Baku International Humanitarian Forum, the Heads of State Summit of the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO), the International Conference of Asian Political Parties (ICAPP), and Eurovision Song Contest 2012; Azerbaijani diplomacy has actively engaged in making arrangements for these events. In September 2012, we also held the Third Conference of Azerbaijani Ambassadors in Baku, which gave us an opportunity to look back at the achievements and look ahead to the coming challenges for our foreign policy. The conference was a great success as it coincided with the inauguration of the new campus of the Azerbaijan Diplomatic Academy, a state-of-the-art building to educate and train Azerbaijani diplomats and students in the future. In his address, President Ilham Aliyev touched on the achievements of Azerbaijani diplomacy and identified the concrete tasks lying ahead, which we are now concentrated on.</p><h4>How is your Ministry working to expand non-oil relations and cooperation with the EU?</h4><p>Developing and strengthening partnership with the EU in political, economic, and humanitarian spheres is one of the priorities of Azerbaijan's foreign policy. Mutual cooperation with the Union can undoubtedly help us in achieving many of our goals, and we are therefore interested in advancing our bilateral relations. It is vital that the cooperation between Azerbaijan and the EU is built on the basis of efficiency, equal partnership, mutual understanding, and respect. Azerbaijan is steadily pursuing the modernization of the country in all areas, and it is important that the EU, as one of our partners, closely participates in this process. The approximation of Azerbaijan's legislation with European standards, the strengthening of democracy and the rule of law, the development of trade and economic ties, and integration into the common European education sphere remain among our priorities. Hence, our cooperation should embrace all areas of common interest based on a balanced approach, and in this regard the EU should take into account the priorities and needs of Azerbaijan. In particular, areas of cooperation such as agriculture, agribusiness, health, culture, tourism, and ICT, which are of interest to Azerbaijan, should be further explored and developed. Furthermore, Azerbaijan is highly interested in working closer with the EU in the field of human capacity building, including education, research, and youth development, as a foundation for our future growth. Azerbaijan actively cooperates both in the bilateral and multilateral formats in the framework of the Eastern Partnership (EaP). In our view, the EaP provides a useful framework for enhancing cooperation opportunities and deepening integration process. The core values set in the EaP, namely joint ownership, responsibility, and accountability, should be regarded as fundamental for the successful achievement of our commonly agreed goals. Azerbaijan envisages its relations with the EU in a broader context and does not intend to limit these relations to the framework of the European Neighborhood Policy or EaP. From this perspective, our country intends to build strategic partnership with the EU beyond the energy sector. According to the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on strategic partnership in the energy field signed between Azerbaijan and the EU in 2006, it is possible to extend this strategic partnership to other sectors. Since the very first days of the establishment of the EaP, Azerbaijan, as the only energy rich country and net exporter of hydrocarbons, expressed its genuine interest and political will in helping the EU develop the concept of the Southern Gas Corridor. The participation of our Head of State in the Southern Corridor Summit in Prague in May 2009 demonstrated the continued interest of Azerbaijan in making its contribution to energy security in Europe not only through diversified routes of supply, but most importantly by enabling diversified sources of those supplies. Furthermore, in January 2011 Azerbaijan reiterated its position to enhance the ongoing dialogue on energy security with the EU during the visit of the President of the European Commission to Azerbaijan, when the two Presidents signed the Joint Declaration on the Southern Gas Corridor. The signing of that document represented a milestone for maximizing opportunities through enhancing regional transportation infrastructure, and Azerbaijan was recognized as the enabler of the development of the corridor. Currently, there are a few projects on the transportation of natural gas from Azerbaijan as well as from the larger Caspian basin area to the European market. However, decisions to be taken by Azerbaijan along with our partners will be based first and foremost on the principles of commercial viability, profitability, transparency, and long-term predictability of various segments of the European market. We believe that enhancing our contribution to the energy security of Europe will also reciprocate and deliver many benefits to Azerbaijan, among which we put an emphasis on access to the European market.</p><h4>How can Azerbaijan capitalize on the increasing global economic significance of Eastern countries such as China, and how do you assess Azerbaijan's relations with its Eastern counterparts?</h4><p>It is well known that the East has now become a new powerhouse for global economic growth at the current time of deep economic uncertainties. Azerbaijan's foreign and economic relations embrace all geographic directions, including countries in the East. Azerbaijan is located on the historic Silk Road, and in fact we were the very first country to join the Transportation Corridor Europe Caucasus Asia (TRASECA) program, which envisages the revitalization of this lifeline for development and prosperity. Azerbaijan enjoys developing trade relations with most countries in the East, in particular China, Japan, South Korea, and Indonesia. We have made formal decisions to open new diplomatic missions in countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Oman in recognition of the importance of diversified foreign and trade relations and increased economic opportunities for our country. Azerbaijan is the key initiator of the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars rail link, which once completed will undoubtedly increase the economic interaction between Azerbaijan and the East. Moreover, the new seaports and airports that are being constructed will also provide vital transportation infrastructure for the increasing trade and economic activities in the wider Caspian and Central Asian region.</p><div class="quote">“Azerbaijan wants peace so that we can continue to grow our economy."</div><h4>How has Azerbaijan contributed to regional trade and cooperation in the Caucasus?</h4><p>Azerbaijan is interested in developing mutually beneficial economic and trade relations with all countries. Within the South Caucasus region, Azerbaijan has been sustainably developing economic relations with its strategic partner Georgia, which is a party to major regional projects in the energy and transport spheres. As a result, bilateral trade turnover between Azerbaijan and Georgia grows yearly. Meanwhile, our country has no bilateral economic links with Armenia, whose armed forces still continue to keep under occupation around 20% of Azerbaijan's territories. Azerbaijan wants peace so that we can continue to grow our economy, develop our energy resources, and advance our relations with the Euro-Atlantic communities and our neighbors. Armenia also has a stake in peace with Azerbaijan. It is isolated in the region because of this unresolved conflict, and excluded from all the regional infrastructure and energy projects, like the oil and gas pipelines passing from the Caspian Sea to Turkey and Europe via Georgia, as well as the new railroad line that will be inaugurated in 2014. When we can agree on lasting peace, Armenia could become one of the stakeholders in these regional projects. Azerbaijan has been keeping its leading status in economic performance in the South Caucasus. It is widely known that our country is the initiator and driving force of major regional projects in areas such as energy, transport, ICT, and continues to maintain and develop those projects also with the active involvement of regional and international organizations. Huge regional energy and transport projects such as Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan, Baku-Tbilisi-Erzurum, and Baku-Tbilisi-Kars can serve as best examples of successful regional cooperation.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>NATO and Azerbaijan have recently taken important steps to deepen our partnership further. Azerbaijan has committed stronger and longer contributions to the international peace effort in Afghanistan, which NATO is leading. And for our part, NATO is also looking at ways that we can do more together. In fact, the depth of our cooperation might surprise those who have not been following NATO's evolution. Of course, many people know the basics of NATO. For over six decades, NATO has united democratic nations from both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. Today, we have 28 allies committed to defend not only our shared security, but also our common values: freedom, democracy, and human rights. We operate under a firm principle: all for one, and one for all. That means that if one ally is threatened, all the other allies will come to its defense.<br></p><p>NATO will continue to build on the success of working with our partners to deepen the understanding and trust that we have built together over the past two decades and to consolidate the invaluable practical experience that our military forces have gained by working together in Afghanistan and in other NATO-led missions and operations. We are determined to work more closely with our partners, including those in this region. We need partners who share our desire for security and our values. In this respect, we encourage Azerbaijan to pursue democratic reforms in certain areas such as elections and free media, which will first and foremost benefit the country. I also believe that there is more we can do together when we it comes to practical cooperation. I believe that this is a two-way street with benefits for NATO and all of its partners.</p><p>The NATO-Azerbaijan partnership gives the country access to a unique security forum—a seat at the table, where it can address vital security concerns such as Afghanistan, allies, and partners. My aim is to have more of such discussions on a broader range of current and new security challenges, such as energy security and cyber defense. Our partnership also supports Azerbaijan's reforms, especially in defense, where it is developing a modern and accountable military force that is relevant to today's security challenges and able to play its part in multinational operations. Much of our cooperation is focused on military-to-military exercises, such as training and education. We are also deepening our cooperation on energy and cyber security. This might seem far away from the needs of average people, but we also do things together that may have more tangible benefits. For example, NATO and the Azerbaijan Mine Agency have removed large quantities of land mines from the soil in this country. Half a million unexploded munitions have been defused. This is one of the biggest projects of this nature in the world, and our work is freeing up hundreds of hectares of land for agriculture and development. Those remnants from the past have endangered lives. Now, people can walk, farm, and open businesses on that land. This project is literally “paving the way" to a better future, and I might add that the Azerbaijani agency is now helping with de-mining in other countries, including Afghanistan.</p><div class="quote">“NATO will continue to build on the success of working with our partners to deepen the trust that we have built together."</div><p>However, this region still faces great security challenges. Azerbaijan has a complicated neighborhood and the most pressing regional challenge remains finding a solution to the Nagorno-Karabakh Conflict. Two things are clear. First, there is no military solution. Second, the only way forward is through dialogue, compromise, and cooperation. NATO as an organization is not involved directly in finding a solution to this conflict, nor do we take sides, but we will continue to support the Minsk Process and efforts toward a peaceful settlement. There must be no return to conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Tensions in this region must be reduced, and concrete steps must be taken to promote reasonable cooperation and reconciliation.</p><p>Azerbaijan is an important partner for NATO and we have already achieved a great deal together. We have an opportunity to do much more to solidify our long-term partnership, strengthen our political dialogue and practical corporation, and hopefully contribute to a better and more peaceful future for this region where trust and trade is restored, borders are opened, and the people of this country and region can truly benefit from its huge strategic potential.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Azerbaijan is unique in so many ways, lying at the crossroads of Europe and Asia. It has been a transit corridor throughout the ages; from the ancient Silk Road to today's energy pipelines. Trade and exchange across borders have fostered over centuries a tradition of openness in its society, where many ethnic and religious communities have thrived together. At the same time, Azerbaijan's impressive recent economic growth spurred by the oil and gas sector shines a great spotlight on the country. I am impressed to see this modern dynamism here in Baku. The challenge today is to build on this momentum and secure the sustainability of the growing economy and modernization.<br></p><p>The EU wants to deepen its ties with Azerbaijan. I should like to emphasize this right from the start, since the ambitions we have for our relationship with Azerbaijan will only be achieved if they are built on peace, security, and stability in the region. I share these observations with our own European experience of reconciliation in mind. The European project was born out of the idea that we would not be prisoners of our history, that we could overcome the scars of conflict and bring former enemies together to build a better future. In the course of 60 years of European integration, we have always managed to overcome difficulties through dialogue, consensus building, and political will. Each time further progress was questioned, the forces tying us together have proven stronger than those setting us apart.</p><p>The present economic and financial crisis, which erupted in 2008 in the US, has affected almost all economies across the world. In Europe, we weathered the first phase relatively well, but the situation has become more challenging since the banking crisis turned into a crisis of public debt. Since I myself took office as President of the European Council in early 2010, overcoming this crisis has been our overriding concern. It may well be the most challenging period in the history of European integration. However, if we can handle the situation with determination and accountability, we will be stronger. There is much work still ahead, but we are determined to carry it out and lay the foundations for the future. We are addressing systemic challenges for the Economic and Monetary Union, and working to make it fully secure, safe, and stable. We are learning the lessons, in terms of fiscal discipline, structural reforms, and deepening integration. But this has to be done in an accountable way, and it has to be done in a transparent way. There is work to be done for months and even years ahead to strengthen the foundations for continued future prosperity, as well as adapt and safeguard the European model for the next generations.</p><div class="quote">“The EU is happy to see Azerbaijan as a rising international partner, with a growing regional role."</div><p>This European model, based on principles, values, freedom, solidarity, and justice, has also inspired the way we deal with neighbors in our immediate surroundings and further away. The EU has a Neighborhood Policy for all our neighbors to the south and east. In 2013, drawing the lessons from the developments in the Arab world, we reflected upon our approach. Europe's renewed Neighborhood Policy has clear goals: to offer greater support to partners engaged in building deep and sustainable democracies, and to support inclusive economic development more effectively. Those who do more in terms of progress get more in terms of support. We call this the more-for-more principle.</p><p>The 2011 Warsaw Summit of the Eastern Partnership has emphasized the common values that underpin our relations. We want to see our partnership with eastern neighbors based more on stronger foundations than just economic cooperation. That is why we attach such a great importance to civil society. The role of civil society is paramount in any country's modernization. The greater the engagement of civil society, the deeper the democracy with political pluralism and a system of checks and balances.</p><p>The EU is happy to see Azerbaijan as a rising international partner, with a growing regional role. In assuming a seat as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council, Azerbaijan is showing its commitment to work for international peace and security. This comes with a great responsibility that I am confident the country will fulfill. The EU sees Azerbaijan as a strategic partner on energy. Azerbaijan is considered a reliable supplier and will, in the future, become a reliable transit provider for both gas and oil. The EU strongly supports the Southern Energy Corridor and the Trans-Caspian Pipeline; they will benefit all sides. While we look toward the Caspian, I must say that developments in Iran are as much a source of concern in Europe as they are here in Azerbaijan.</p><p>Before I conclude, a word on the current developments in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. The benefits of economic and political development, trade, and prosperity cannot fully be realized without a sustained effort to build stability between neighbors. Indeed, the medium- to long-term goals of future agreements make no sense if the threat of conflict is going to be a permanent presence in the background. But let me be clear: this is a reality and it has to be faced. The EU will continue to insist that Azerbaijan and Armenia step up their efforts to reach agreement. The so-called Madrid Principles remain a valid basis for peace, in accordance with the commitments made by the Presidents of both countries to France, Russia, and the US as co-chairs of the OSCE's Minsk Group. We will continue to ask for unconditional access for representatives of the EU to Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding regions. The EU calls on both sides to strictly respect the ceasefire and exercise restraint, on the ground and in public statements, in order to prevent further escalation of the situation. Threats and the use of force do not contribute to a resolution of this persisting conflict. The efforts of the Minsk Group and its co-chairs to seek a peaceful resolution have our full support. Where useful, we stand ready to provide extra assistance for confidence-building measures. And once there is a settlement agreement, the EU will be ready to help implement it, including rehabilitation assistance. Reaching a solution will take time. Building trust is the first step toward finding a solution. This is one of the messages that Ambassador Lefort, the EU's Special Representative for Southern Caucasus and the crisis in Georgia, tries to convey to all our partners in the region.</p><p>Without trust, there will never be peace. Many of the good things in life take time to achieve. You do not build a house in one day. You do not make peace in one day. You do not establish a democracy in one day. But if you want to get to the roof, you must start by building it brick by brick. The work must continue, knowing that it will take time. I am confident Azerbaijani society can successfully complete this house of national democracy and regional peace. The EU will continue to work with you.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What kind of work has been carried out by the Ministry to prepare for large-scale earthquakes and other natural disasters?<br></h4><p>The Caucasus, a part of the Alpine-Himalayan belt, is one of the most seismically active zones in the world, and Azerbaijan's territory is characterized as a high-tectonic area. Since ancient times, strong and catastrophic earthquakes have caused a large amount of human loss and destruction. Since the Ministry has been operating, the best practices of the most advanced countries have been applied for the purpose of improving warning systems for natural and man-made disasters, as well as for the realization of emergency risk evaluation work and the formation and supply of monitoring networks with state-of-art technologies. We have set up early warning systems for natural disasters, and a lot of work has been carried out to educate people about natural and man-made disasters. Comprehensive information on the code of conduct during emergencies is regularly published on the official website and in the newspaper of the Ministry of Emergency Situations. For this purpose, meetings are conducted in different businesses and educational institutions by different bodies and regional centers of the Ministry, where booklets, brochures, and posters are prepared as well as different kinds of competitions and contests are held for the purpose of generating a life safety culture among the youth. At the same time, particular attention is attached to the protection of the population and territories against natural and man-made disasters with the improvement of the civil defense system by providing the prompt elimination of the consequences of disasters. We are also increasing the preparation level of our civil defense forces, developing opportunities to effectively realize search and rescue operations in high-risk conditions, and strengthening training programs regarding organizing the evacuation of population, material, and spiritual wealth to safe territories to minimize losses. As a result of a grade-seven earthquake—the epicenter being in the Zagatala region—residential buildings and infrastructure in the Zagatala, Balakan, and Gakh regions were seriously damaged. The command center for the earthquake was established promptly and rescue forces mobilized to the region in cooperation with local forces launched the process for the search and rescue and evacuation of victims, as well as rendering first aid to them. Also, the appropriate measures have been taken to define the extent of damage to local infrastructure and social objects. The Ministry sent tents, food, and construction materials to the population in these regions. In addition, commissions consisting of experts of related bodies to the Ministry inspected damaged buildings and infrastructure, and construction work has begun in the abovementioned regions with AZN20 million allocated from the President's Reserve Fund according to the instructions of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan, with AZN300 million more allocated in accordance with the state budget of 2012. At the moment, necessary measures are being taken for the timely completion of this important task given by the head of state. On the other hand, for the purpose of protecting the population and territories from floods, overflows, and inundation, complex measures for the improvement of the management system of underground and surface water resources in the country, providing reliable protection of important water reservoirs, technical safety of hydro-junctions, water reservoir dams, river protection, canal dams, collector-drainage systems, and related hydro-technical installations, have been taken. In this regard, the State Water Resources Agency of the Ministry of Emergency Situations was established in 2011 on the basis of a presidential decree, which was a very important and progressive step.</p><h4>Training plays an important role in building capacity to respond to emergencies. How is the Ministry involved in this area?</h4><p>We give great importance to training for the purpose of increasing the proficiency of staff as well as strengthening their knowledge and skills. Over the years, our employees have participated in local and international training programs organized by the Ministry of Emergency Situations, as well as by other authorities and international organizations. Additionally, a number of training programs have been organized at the ministerial level and throughout different bodies in the Ministry. I want to mention some special events that have been held such as the “Caspian 2010" training program, which was held on December 16, 2010. All kinds of rescue forces from the Ministry of Emergency Situations, such as personnel, aircraft, helicopters, ships, firefighting vehicles, and other special vehicles were involved in this training program, and large-scale operations for rescue on sea and on shore were staged. On January 24-25, 2011, a tabletop exercise on the topic of “Flood management, water treatment, and public health issues" was held in Baku with the participation of representatives from the Office of Military Cooperation of the US Embassy in Azerbaijan, the Headquarters of the US Land Forces on public health issues, delegations of the Armed Forces representing the European Headquarters, the Ministry of Emergency Situations, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources, and the Azerenergy and Azersu joint-stock companies. From July 25-28, 2011, a tabletop exercise on the topic of “Inter-ministerial relations" was held in Baku with the participation of representatives from the Office of Military Cooperation of the US Embassy in Azerbaijan, as well as delegations representing the US Army Corps of Engineers, Ministry of Emergency Situations, and other relevant bodies. In addition, from August 27 to September 2, 2011, the Search and Rescue Team of the Ministry of Emergency Situations participated in the international exercise “CODRII — 2011," which was held in Moldova and was organized by NATO's Euro-Atlantic Disaster Response Coordination Center (EADRCC). On September 29, 2011, training on the topic of “Organizing the joint activity of relevant bodies and rescue services of the Republic of Azerbaijan, the Russian Federation, and the Republic of Kazakhstan in the elimination of the consequences of emergencies resulting from tanker collisions with unknown ships in the territory of stationary oil platforms" was held in the northern part of the Caspian Sea in the Yuri Korchagin oil field of LUKOIL OSC. On May 17, 2012, an exercise was held with the participation of relevant forces of the Ministry of Emergency Situations for the purpose of the timely prevention and quick elimination of the consequences of emergencies that could happen during the Eurovision 2012 Song Contest, and on May 19, 2012 an exercise was held by the Ministry of Emergency Situations, the Ministry of Interior Affairs, the Ministry of National Security, the Ministry of Health, the Special State Protection Service, and State Cross-Border Service during this contest. From September 22-28, 2012, the Azerbaijan's search and rescue (SAR) team participated in the NATO EADRCC exercise held in Tbilisi, Georgia. Azerbaijan's SAR team was the largest team in the exercise, participating with 12 vehicles and 70 personnel. Overall, some 30 teams participated in the exercise.</p><h4>What types of measures are being taken in the country to prevent nuclear and radiological accidents?</h4><p>For the purpose of regulating attitudes in the field of nuclear and radiological safety in the Republic and the proper fulfillment of international obligations binding upon it, the State Agency for the Regulation of Nuclear and Radiological Activity of the Ministry of Emergency Situations was established in accordance with Decree No. 746 of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan, dated April 24, 2008. This state agency is an executive body participating in ensuring the nuclear and radiological safety of the population and territories, and the development of state policy on the regulation of nuclear and radiological activities. Thus, preparations for radiation accidents and the existence of response plans and their compliance with the danger, proper personnel preparation, and logistical means are controlled by the Agency during inspections carried out with the establishment and organization of the country containing radioactive elements. However, as response measures for nuclear and radiological accidents at the institutional and organizational level are not enough, we attach great importance to cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to increase the preparation level for radiological accidents. For the purpose of protecting and correctly informing the population during large-scale nuclear and radiological accidents and taking urgent measures against radiation accidents, we proposed to benefit from the services of the Incident and Emergency Centre of the IAEA, being a coordination center during radiological and nuclear accidents functioning on a 24/7 basis without a break for rendering urgent aid. This is an operative coordination and information body providing prompt response measures on the basis of prepared mechanisms by mutual interaction between the IAEA and competent bodies. The IAEA highly appreciated our suggestions. Joining the Incident and Emergency Centre of the IAEA, the State Agency for the Regulation of Nuclear and Radiological Activity has been appointed as the National Competent Body and the Crisis Management Center and National Warning Point in the country. In order to increase preparation levels for nuclear and radiological accidents in the country and to carry out prompt and effective response measures, a new technical cooperation project called the “Support for the preparation of a local radiological accident plan" has been launched by the Ministry in cooperation with the IAEA. The project's execution phase covers 2012 and 2013. Under the project, it is intended to develop the National Plan for Radiological Disasters agreed with concerned bodies by defining the state bodies in Azerbaijan involved in each phase of the preparation and response to radiological disasters. Necessary arrangements for implementing response measures at the institutional, organizational, local, national, and international levels during nuclear and radiological disasters will be considered in this Plan. Initial preparatory works for the project have been fulfilled since the beginning of 2012. In addition, experts of the Ministry developed a “twinning" project with foreign experts in order to learn the best practices from the EU in the field of radiation safety, as well as to improve radiation safety culture, legal bases, infrastructure, and other supporting services in the Republic of Azerbaijan in accordance with international rules. The project will last two years and will be completed by the end of 2013. Employees of the Ministry take part in training, seminars, and other events within many projects carried out by the IAEA in the field of nuclear and radiological disaster management. We attach great importance to the experience of the IAEA and also other leading countries in this field to increase capacity building, as well as acquire technologies used for providing radiation safety in the nuclear and radiological activity field.</p><div class="quote">“We attach great importance to cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to increase the preparation level for radiological accidents."</div>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>In December 1991, shortly after the fall of the Soviet Union, US Secretary of State James Baker gave a speech at Princeton University on the relationship between the US and the “Newly Independent States" of the former USSR. In his remarks, Baker took aim at a curious target—the tiny Republic of Azerbaijan. About the size of the state of Maine, Baker described it as “undeserving of American recognition" until it accepted a long list of conditions the US had required. Soviet watchers saw it as the work of the US lobby of Azerbaijan's neighbor and sworn enemy, Armenia, to blacklist the ancient nation in the Caucuses region on the Caspian Sea.<br></p><p>However, it proved to be the shortest blacklist in history. On Christmas Day, 1991, the USSR ceased to exist and the US recognized 12 former Soviet states, including Azerbaijan. A few months later, Baker became the first US Secretary of State to tour the region, and officially resumed diplomatic relations with the Azerbaijanis for the first time since 1918.</p><p>Under President Bill Clinton, the US deepened this relationship, signing a $10 billion investment contract with Azerbaijan to develop its oil fields. After the attacks of 9/11, President George W. Bush broadened the relationship to include military collaboration, with Azerbaijan providing its airspace for the US invasion of Iraq, while becoming the first Muslim nation to send its soldiers to fight alongside US troops. While in Baku in 2008, one US diplomat told me that Azerbaijan was “central to all we're trying to do in this part of the world." Then-US Ambassador Anne Derse described it to me as “Houston on the Caspian"—the indispensable link to reducing European energy independence on Moscow, as Azerbaijan is home to the only pipelines exporting Caspian oil and gas that bypass Russia altogether.</p><div class="quote">“Azerbaijan will likely double its natural gas production, further enhancing its influence on Europe."</div><p>One of the most surprising aspects of Azerbaijan—a country that is 85% Shi'ite Muslim—is its close alliance with Israel. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited during his first term in office in 1997, and the partnership has only deepened since, particularly as long-time Israeli ally Turkey has turned its back on Tel Aviv. Israel is now the second-largest importer of Azerbaijani oil, and with the recent signing of a $1.6 billion arms agreement, the military relationship between the two countries has raised eyebrows. Earlier in 2012, Iran accused Azerbaijan of supporting anti-Iranian activity by Israel's Mossad, while Azerbaijan charged 22 suspects in an Iranian plot to attack the Israeli embassy in Baku. In March 2012, an explosive foreign policy article reported Israeli plans to potentially—and unilaterally—strike Iran's nuclear facilities using Azerbaijani bases for reconnaissance, refueling, and rescue operations.</p><p>Meanwhile, as sanctions squeeze Tehran, Azerbaijan produced nearly 100,000 barrels of oil and 15 billion cubic meters of natural gas last year, much of which it exported to European countries eager for reliable energy sources. When the Shah Deniz II fields come online in the next five years, Azerbaijan will likely double its natural gas production, further enhancing its influence on Europe.</p><p>It's true that, like many former Soviet states and US allies, Azerbaijan still struggles with civil liberties, human rights, and fundamental freedoms—issues Secretary of State Hillary Clinton raised with President Aliyev during a trip to Baku in June 2012, while announcing that “the US remains strongly committed to working with the government and people (of Azerbaijan)."</p><p>The Obama Administration needs to do more than that. It should explore whether a combination of aid, incentives, and diplomacy could help resolve Azerbaijan's festering conflict with Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh. It should add a small US ground presence to demonstrate its commitment to the country's security, while pushing for greater NATO cooperation with Azerbaijan. And, it should assist the EU in securing the Nabucco-West natural gas pipeline, which will ensure European energy security, enrich Azerbaijan, and bring the country closer to the West.</p><p>Home to more than half of the world's mud volcanoes, with flames that occasionally erupt hundreds of feet into the sky, “Azerbaijan" literally translates to the “Land of Fire." In the tinderbox that is the Caspian Region and the Middle East, a stronger US-Azerbaijan partnership might help assure that cooler heads prevail.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[An Investment in Time]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[an-investment-in-time]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of the Az Group of Companies?<br></h4><p>My motivation while building Az Group was the rapid development of Azerbaijan. I identified in which sectors Azerbaijan was seeing growth, and which sectors were the most important for the future development of the country. I began the company in 2006, and I am still building and adding to the companies that have come out of this project.</p><h4>The President has expressed a desire to see more investment in non-energy sectors. Do you agree that this is the best way forward?</h4><p>Absolutely. One area that is crucial is agro-industry. This is because the agro-industry sector can be developed to the point where it generates more revenue for Azerbaijan than oil and gas. A developing country always needs new technology, but in terms of true growth in the next few years, agro-industry will grow very rapidly.</p><h4>How would you describe the FMCG sector in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>It is growing well. The main reason for this is growing household income. People can now afford better goods and more quality foodstuffs. This will continue to be the source of growth in the FMCG sector.</p><div class="quote">“People can now afford better goods and more quality foodstuffs."</div><h4>You have recently added a new line of plastics production. What impact do you expect this to have?</h4><p>We were importing packaging from Turkey for use with dairy products and ice cream, but we always had transportation issues. I therefore decided to invest in a modern, state-of-the-art packaging facility to the tune of ‚¬22 million. By the end of February 2013, we will be producing all the packaging we need for our own dairy products and other products. I hope to supply one-time-use plastic packaging products to all dairy producers. This will be good for the country's packaging industry, and it will mean we never have to import packaging products again.</p><h4>What is the strategy behind the duty-free shops you operate in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>AZ Duty-Free Shops operate along the borders and include the Astara Duty-Free border store. We also recently opened a new diplomatic store in Baku's business district, which consists of 400 sqm of retail space. It is only for the foreign diplomats in Azerbaijan, as well as officials of UNESCO, the Red Cross, and the World Bank. We will also be building a store on the Georgian and Russian borders. They will be operational by mid-2013.</p><h4>Baku is experiencing a huge construction boom. What impact is this having on AZ MDF, your furniture subsidiary?</h4><p>In 2006, due to rapid growth in the real estate sector, I realized that medium-density fiberboard (MDF) was being imported from across the world, from countries such as Turkey and Iran. I decided to establish an MDF factory, bring the wood in from Russia via rail, and produce MDF here. This is then bought raw or customized by our customers. Later, in 2009, I decided that this was not cost effective. I decided the best way to cover the cost of my investment was to produce high-density fiberboard (HDF), which is thinner. By investing around ‚¬25 million, we will be producing laminated flooring, parquet flooring, doors, and windows from March 2013. With new lines coming into operation, we will be producing, for example, all the parquet flooring that Azerbaijan needs and exporting the excess. The same is true for doors, windows, and kitchen cabinets. By making this investment, I hope to make enough profit to ensure that my investment is returned. We will, one day, export to Iran, Turkey, and Georgia. However, for now, the Azerbaijani market is sufficient.</p><h4>Az Group of Companies has become very successful in construction, and especially the construction of roads. To what do you owe this success?</h4><p>Lots of materials are required to build roads. Today, we are the largest producer of concrete aggregate and asphalt. We have situated our plants all over the country, and we now supply the entire market with our products. We are capable of producing 72,000 tons of aggregate and 42,000 tons of asphalt per day. We now supply aggregate to every construction firm in the country, including highway construction companies. Our products were used on Gabala Airport in Azerbaijan, including the highway that goes there.</p><h4>What is your involvement with Aztech Group?</h4><p>Az Group also runs a facility to distribute Volvo trucks, Mack trucks, and Volvo construction equipment, and is also a world leader in aggregate and asphalt plants. It is also the exclusive distributor of Aztech Group's products. We run the largest Volvo equipment service center in the whole CIS, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East region.</p><h4>How would you describe the current economic outlook in Azerbaijan in 2013?</h4><p>Everybody in the world sees that this country is growing rapidly and it is both politically and economically stable. Oil and gas revenues are also growing. I see the country growing every year for the next decade and maybe more.</p><h4>What are your medium-term goals for Az Group of Companies?</h4><p>At the moment, I am happy with how things are going. From 2013, my main concentration will be on agro-industry, which means vegetables and fruits and other sectors. We will be directly involved in planting, growing, and harvesting, as well as exporting across Europe and the Middle East. Azerbaijan boasts high-quality fruit, but there weren't enough cold storage facilities in the past to benefit from this. We have facilities for 10,000 tons of fruit, which is not small. We will also build a few more facilities in agricultural areas in order to cut down on transportation costs.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the background of ZQAN Holding, and how did you become involved in the establishment of the company?<br></h4><p>As the saying goes, “the deeper one gets into something, the more involved they become." I have always longed and pursued the establishment and promotion of a holding company that could gain access to any market in the world. Thus, through hard work I managed to make my life-long dream a reality, and I launched ZQAN Holding in 2000. Initially, ZQAN Holding's activities and work primarily covered the business areas of finance, hospitality, construction, and transportation. Starting in 2013, we will focus on the production and services sectors as well. Our main target is to develop local business and stimulate the improvement of Azerbaijan's business ties throughout the world. We are also planning to implement active operations in the areas of agricultural products and the food industry. Our key priority is to become a company that supports the economic growth of the country and assists it in assuming a good standing in various world markets. In addition, we seek to promote Azerbaijan as a developing, flourishing, and progressive country in the business world. Our motto is “creating national values for Azerbaijan," and we always stay true to this idea. We are eager to enlarge Azerbaijan's sphere of influence. We do our best to establish close working relationships with other countries and build a strong business network. A good business person, outside of his or her native state, should strengthen the image of their country and be supportive of it in every way.</p><h4>ZQAN Holding owns and includes a wide range of companies, operating in various areas of business. Which one has been the most successful and advantageous in recent times?</h4><p>To be successful, a company must have branches as well as roots. As a unit institution, we are interested in the success of all of our companies. I am working to focus on the activities of each company and the overall structure of ZQAN Holding. We, as a company, are striving to do our utmost to be successful in every business area. The development line of each company is clarified and determined as a result of relevant research and analysis. Although we have both successful companies and slightly weaker ones, we strive to capitalize on the best aspects of each of our companies.</p><h4>Within the construction sector, ZQAN Holding has taken the advantage of owning both ZQAN Construction and Azbentonit, a concrete production company. How does this affect your competitive advantage?</h4><p>The availability of building materials allows us to realize the management of quality and control our standards. Construction developed on our behalf—residential structures, tourist attractions, and public facilities—meets our high-quality standards. We control the quality, durability, and reliability of our materials. These are the main and most significant factors in the sector and they affect the very culture of construction. They are also indicators of our attitude and respect toward the citizens of the country and the people who will use our structures.</p><div class="quote">“To be successful, a company must have branches as well as roots."</div><h4>How have you seen the investment climate in Azerbaijan change over the past decade?</h4><p>Azerbaijan has already achieved huge success in terms of various economic reforms. Today, we are citizens of a country that is able to compete on an international level, with new economic progress and impressive achievements. The economic indications of the last decade are very promising and praiseworthy. Our economic growth is rapidly increasing and progressing, as we achieve new targets and goals throughout the country.</p><h4>What are your medium-term plans for the company?</h4><p>We expect 2013 to be fruitful and promising for ZQAN Holding. We are planning to outlay simultaneous large-scale projects within several sectors. We are going to launch projects of significant value in the agricultural and tourism sectors. Furthermore, 2013 will see the opening of a poultry factory and a branch of the Rixos Hotel in the region of Guba. We are also planning to open a new professional golf course for the public, which I believe will promote the further development of the sport and make it popular among all walks of life. The opening of Trump Tower Baku, a well-known and global brand that constructs residential structures, will happen in 2013. It will be not only a new building, but also a modern and original piece of the city's architecture. Moreover, several important projects will be carried out and accomplished on behalf of the Azerbaijan America Alliance. The realization of these projects will cover the areas of education and culture. Outreach campaigns, cultural events, and mutual bilateral educational exchange programs held in different cities and states of the US will lead to firm collaboration between the two countries.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What contributions has Akkord Industry Construction Investment Corporation been making to the development of the local construction market and the non-oil sector in general?<br></h4><p>As a public interest entity, Akkord Corporation is strongly committed to making its contribution to the development of the local construction market and generally the non-oil sector of Azerbaijan's economy. Within a short period of time, Akkord Corporation managed to become a national leader in the construction business field. In Azerbaijan, we are currently involved in large-scale road infrastructure projects of a total contract value of approximately AZN314 million. To date, the corporation has completed infrastructure projects with a total contract value of more than $1.7 billion in Azerbaijan and abroad.</p><p>In addition, the corporation has been continuously developing two other lines of its core business: the construction of real estate and public facilities, and the production and processing of construction materials. As an important construction materials supplier, we provide concrete and concrete precasts, asphalt, gravel, sand, bricks, fabricated metal products, and others—not only for our own needs, but also for the wider market in Azerbaijan. Notably, Akkord Corporation is finalizing the installation of the first production line of its brand new cement plant in the Gazakh region of Azerbaijan. In general, the corporation owns and operates 39 various plants throughout the country. Regarding real estate development, the corporation has constructed and commissioned 10 housing estates covering a residential area of more than 775,000 sqm and more than 56,000 sqm of commercial space in Baku.</p><p>One of our most recent business directions is the construction of water supply and sewage infrastructure systems in Azerbaijan. Currently, Akkord Corporation is implementing 11 such projects in six regions of the country, with a total contract value of almost AZN300 million. At a conference dedicated to the results of the fourth year of the implementation of the State Program for Social and Economic Development of the Regions of the Republic of Azerbaijan for 2009-2013, held on February 12, 2013 under the chairmanship of President Ilham Aliyev, the Head of State restated the priority of development in the non-oil sector of the economy and the strengthening of the export potential of the country. Through heavy investments in industry and manufacturing, the introduction of new technology and know-how, and the creation of new workplaces, Akkord Corporation makes a substantial contribution to the development of the non-oil sector.</p><h4>What are some of the major domestic projects that Akkord is currently involved in?</h4><p>There are several publicly significant projects I would like to emphasize. A long-term Conceptual Development Scheme for the Baku Metro, prepared following the President's decree on November 10, 2008, and the “State Program for the Development of Baku Metro in 2011-2015," approved on March 18, 2011, laid the groundwork for the metro's expansion plans. In collaboration with our French partner, Bouygues, we established a joint venture to participate in this expansion project. On November 7, 2012, Akkord-Bouygues JV signed an MoU with the Baku Metro Authority to reconstruct the 28th May Station and build the new Khatai-Azi Aslanov-2 section, a seven-kilometer stretch of the green line. In general, the development plan envisages the construction of more than 50 metro stations and 165 kilometers of tunnels in the coming 20 years in Baku.</p><p>Another project is the Gazakh Cement Plant in western Azerbaijan, the feasibility study of which was worked out by Deloitte. The plant, having the prospective production capacity of 3 million tons of cement per year, will enable us to meet up to 75% of local demand for cement. The plant's construction covers two stages. The first stage envisages the annual production of 1 million tons of cement and will be commissioned in mid-2013. The second stage will produce an additional 2 million tons of cement per year. The development of the Gazakh Cement Plant for Akkord is carried out by CBMI, a subsidiary of the world-renowned SINOMA of China. We will apply the dry cement production method at the plant and the majority of the 1,000 people working at the plant will be recruited locally. President Ilham Aliyev visited the Gazakh Cement Plant to familiarize himself with the construction on April 12, 2012, and evaluated the project very highly.</p><p>Another essential project is a road-tunnel complex at Galaba Square in Baku. The project was designed by Surbana International Consultants of Singapore and an architectural design was developed by Venezia Design of Italy. The road-tunnel complex consists of six tunnels, eight pedestrian crossings, and two new exits at the Ganjlik metro station. So far, one tunnel has been completed and its opening ceremony was led by the President on December 28, 2012. Currently, it is the largest ongoing road-tunnel infrastructure project in Baku.</p><h4>What is the geography and scope of Akkord Corporation's activities abroad?</h4><p>We are currently active in several foreign markets including Turkey, Afghanistan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Ukraine. In addition, in 2012 the corporation opened its representative office in Frankfurt, Germany. The current portfolio of ongoing road infrastructure projects in foreign countries amounts to $1.1 billion. In Uzbekistan, we are a contractor for a project to reconstruct the M39 Tashkent-Termez Road, while in Kazakhstan we are working on the construction of the Western Europe-Western China International Transit Corridor in the Kyzylorda region. In Georgia, we are implementing a project to construct the Kutaisi Bypass Road, and in Ukraine we are rebuilding the Kiev-Chop Road. Furthermore, in Turkey we are involved in the construction of the Akçagöz-Başpınar Road. This international exposure strengthens our experience and intensifies our business contacts with foreign partners such as Salini and Todini of Italy and Freyssinet and Freysas, subsidiaries of Vinci Group in France. We give priority to those projects funded by international financial institutions like the World Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), Asian Development Bank (ADB), and the Islamic Development Bank (IDB). In the future, we are planning to enter the Russian construction market to bid for infrastructure projects that will be announced by the Russian government due to the upcoming 2018 FIFA World Cup.  It is essential to bear in mind that in every foreign country, Akkord Corporation and its activities are representing Azerbaijan and its people. Therefore, we always deliver the best services and best products wherever we are working.</p><h4>What have been the main achievements of Akkord Corporation in the past two years? What are your future plans and goals?</h4><p>We managed to establish and strengthen a good team of professionals dedicated to their work. We have been heavily investing in human capital. A well-integrated corporate governance system was developed to add value to our business. Good governance, strengthened internal controls, and internal audits as well as risk management systems have also been implemented at Akkord. Moreover, we managed to diversify the sources of our financing and improve financial stability. Additionally in 2012, the corporation's charter capital was increased to AZN84 million. Akkord improved its financial reporting standards based on IFRS and contracted Deloitte as external corporate auditors. PwC has been contracted as a rating advisor for the first time assessment of Akkord by Fitch Ratings. In 2013, we are renewing our corporate rating and re-launching our Eurobond project to gain access to low-cost international financial markets. In parallel, we are continuing to bid for new projects domestically and internationally. Our aim is to expand beyond Azerbaijan and become an internationally competitive transnational corporation.</p><h4>How would you evaluate Azerbaijan's economic development and competitiveness level in the international market?</h4><p>Azerbaijan's economic successes are considerable. In the Global Competitiveness Index 2012-2013 by the World Economic Forum, Azerbaijan rose by nine positions and ranked 46 among 144 countries. This means that Azerbaijan is among the 50 most competitive economies in the world. The economic strategy set by President Aliyev precluded the negative impacts of the global financial crisis and ensured steady economic growth. The economy's high growth rates, clear and consistent government investment programs, measures on the diversification of the economy, and continuous support for the development of the non-oil sector will ensure long-lasting economic and social benefits for Azerbaijan and its people.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[how-to-plan-ahead]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>AtaHolding will soon be celebrating its 10th birthday. What are some of the major milestones you have reached over this time, and what are your goals for the next decade?<br></h4><p>Established in September 2003, AtaHolding was the first to bring a culture of holding management to Azerbaijan and to organize it in accordance with modern management standards. The company has secured a number of achievements over this period. If we start with figures, I can say briefly that the total assets of AtaHolding and the companies under its umbrella have increased four times, and the level of capitalization has more than doubled in the past year alone. Our companies have paid more than AZN10 billion in tax and social payments into the state budget. AtaBank, which forms a significant part of the holding's investment portfolio and will celebrate its 20th anniversary in 2013, has covered a long development road over this period. As a result of the measures taken since the establishment of the holding, AtaBank has reinforced its position in the banking sector, becoming one of the country's leading banks and increasing its profitability. AtaBank has played an important part in enhancing public confidence in the banking sector and is currently recognized by relevant regulatory agencies of the country as a backbone bank. I should also say that the investment of AtaHolding in the banking sector of the country is not limited to AtaBank alone. In 2008, AtaHolding acquired a 49% share of VTB Bank, the Azerbaijani branch of one of Russia's biggest banks, VTB Group. In contrast to AtaBank, other companies included in the holding's portfolio started to operate after its establishment. One of these, AtaSigorta has developed extensively over this period to become one of the leading players in the insurance market. Over the last decade, we have also invested extensively in the tourism sector. In particular, in 2005 we opened Azerbaijan's first five-star hotel, Excelsior Hotel Baku. The opening ceremony was attended by President Ilham Aliyev and his wife Mehriban Aliyeva. Having expanded its activities in the country's hotel market, Excelsior Hotel Baku has managed to establish itself as a successful business. We have always been proud to say that AtaHolding has tried to develop its business not only in Baku, but also in other regions of Azerbaijan. The key priority of the decrees and state programs signed by President Aliyev shortly after his sweeping election victory in 2003 has been the development of the country's districts. We understand that along with government agencies, business entities—especially major businesses—should contribute to this process. Therefore, governed by one of the main principles of its strategic concept that Azerbaijan's economic strength means the economic strength of its regions, AtaHolding was one of the first companies to expand its activities into regional areas. As a result, AtaBank established an extensive network of branches throughout the country. Another company that is part of our holding, AtaSenaye, concentrated most of its activities in regional areas. One of its most successful projects is the establishment of a modern poultry farm, Shamkir Gushchulug. Another major area of our activities is in the IT sector. Founded in 2005, AtaTexnologiya, in cooperation with its partners, introduced several innovations to the country's IT sector. The application of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems by local companies has been particularly important. In its operations, AtaHolding is first governed by public interests and then by corporate ones. Therefore, we are proud to say that AtaHolding is one of the country's leaders in the implementation of corporate social responsibility (CSR) projects. In addition to being the main sponsor of several national sports federations, we are the primary sponsor of the International Wrestling Federation (FILA) and the International Hockey Federation (FIH). We have built and commissioned the AtaHolding Center &amp; Marneuli Sport Complex Georgia-Azerbaijan in a part of Georgia that has a predominantly Azerbaijani population. The objective of this project has been to strengthen the friendship between the Azerbaijani and Georgian people, facilitate young people's sporting success, and contribute to the emergence of future Olympic champions. Our goal for the coming years is to further expand our business through effective management of our investment portfolio and to take an active part in the implementation of the “Azerbaijan 2020: Outlook for the Future" development concept. After the concept is finalized, AtaHolding in general and all our business entities in particular will revise their strategies in accordance with the development goals for 2020. Thus, AtaHolding is currently active in various important sectors of the national economy. Since we have great confidence in our development strategy, each project we implement is focused on national and economic interests. This is why our slogan is “Synergy for Azerbaijan." By effectively using modern technologies and the resources of the country, AtaHolding has been striving to meet the needs of its workers and customers, creating synergies and contributing to Azerbaijan's prosperity and economic development.</p><h4>In the medium term, what trends can we expect to see in Azerbaijan's economic development, and what impact will that have on AtaHolding?</h4><p>Azerbaijan is known all over the world as an oil-producing country. However, as a result of the government's policies aimed at the effective management of oil revenues and support for the non-oil sector, the Azerbaijani economy is becoming diversified. Azerbaijan's non-oil sector grew by nearly 10% in 2012. There is great potential for the development of agriculture, tourism, and IT in Azerbaijan. A goal has been set to double GDP by 2020. This growth is expected to be achieved through the development of the non-oil sector. AtaHolding will not only contribute to the implementation of the “Azerbaijan 2020: Outlook for the Future" development concept. We also intend to take advantage of the opportunities that will present themselves as a result. We expect to see greater demand for financial and electronic services. I am confident that reducing the dependence of the Azerbaijani economy on the oil sector and the development of the non-oil economy will enable AtaHolding to further expand its operations.</p><h4>How would you characterize the investment climate in Azerbaijan, and do you believe this is likely to change in the run-up to the 2013 Presidential elections?</h4><p>I think the business climate in Azerbaijan is  favorable. This is confirmed by the reports of international economic institutions. If we look at the World Bank's annual Doing Business report, which represents an authoritative source of information for investors around the world, Azerbaijan has been achieving steady progress in terms of its business environment. There is complete macroeconomic stability in the country. Under the leadership of President Ilham Aliyev, the country's economy was run very successfully during the global economic recession. This is acknowledged by international rating agencies, which shows that the Azerbaijani economy is on the right track. I can say with full confidence that it is not too difficult to predict the victory of the incumbent President Ilham Aliyev in the 2013 presidential election. The overwhelming majority of Azerbaijani citizens support his policies and reforms. Therefore, I am absolutely sure that the business environment will continue to improve in 2013 and beyond.</p><div class="quote">“There is complete macroeconomic stability in the country."</div>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What decisions led to the establishment of Tamiz Shahar JSC, and what were its original goals?<br></h4><p>Tamiz Shahar JSC was established in accordance with a Presidential decree in August 2008, geared toward the improvement of municipal waste management in Baku. Its duty is to build and manage solid municipal waste placement and disposal in accordance with modern standards, and to develop this area through stages based on the principles of a market economy, thereby improving the ecological condition of the city. As per the same decree, the collection and transportation of municipal waste originating in Baku has remained the responsibility of the Baku City Executive Power.</p><h4>What progress has been made since the company's inception?</h4><p>Previously, people used the 120-hectare Balakhani landfill, which was an open and uncontrolled dump site teeming with infection and covered by a cloud of putrid smoke from burning waste. The state-funded Tamiz Shahar JSC was faced with the daunting task of rehabilitating the landfill, which was handed over to us in October 2009. Within a relatively short time, Tamiz Shahar JSC secured the space to prevent unauthorized entry to the site, leveled and landscaped the area, provided personal protective equipment and uniforms to all staff, reconstructed internal roads, and ensured that all waste delivered was recorded and weighed properly. Since then, we have managed to eliminate further fires and acrid smoke. In addition, we launched a relatively small—but environmentally significant—project with a vast contribution to public health in early 2012. Previously, waste-delivery trucks would drive throughout the streets of the capital after emptying collected waste at the landfill, without any form of sanitation. Now, we wash and disinfect the 400 trucks that serve the Balakhani Municipal Solid Waste Landfill. The washing station conforms to health, safety, and environmental standards as well as being equipped with a German washing system from the well-known company Otto Christ AG.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the development and evolution of the Baku Waste-to-Energy Plant?</h4><p>The Baku Waste-to-Energy Plant is an innovative program in modern waste management. The construction of the plant was approved within the framework of “The Comprehensive Action Plan on the Improvement of the Ecological Situation in the Republic Of Azerbaijan 2006-2010," which was signed by the President on September 28, 2006. The Ministry of Economic Development also signed an agreement for the project with a reputable French company, CNIM S.A, in December 2008. The contract is on a turnkey basis and is being carried out according to the design-build-operate principle. The plant was inaugurated by President Aliyev on December 19, 2012. The Baku Waste-to-Energy Plant boasts an annual capacity of 500,000 tons of municipal waste and 10,000 tons of medical waste per year, which makes it one of the largest in Europe and the first of its kind in the CIS region. The total amount of waste that is sourced from Baku amounts to around 1.2 million tons per year, and almost 40% of that waste is recyclable at the Waste-to-Energy Plant.</p><div class="quote">“The Baku Waste-to-Energy Plant is expected to save 
the country energy that is roughly equal to 60 million cubic meters of natural gas per year."</div><h4>How is waste recycled into energy at the Baku Waste-to-Energy Plant?</h4><p>Waste releases energy during combustion and, in fact, no external energy is needed to burn waste during normal operation. In the boiler, this energy is transferred from combustion gas to water, which evaporates into steam at 400 °C. The steam is then expanded into a turbine generator set, which turns its energy into electricity. The total electricity production is projected to be 270 million kWh per year. The plant consumes 15% of the electricity produced and the remaining 85%, or approximately 231 million kWh per year, is sent to the electrical grid. This distributed electricity will meet the demand of more than 50,000 households. The Baku Waste-to-Energy Plant is expected to save the country energy that is roughly equal to 60 million cubic meters of natural gas per year. The plant was constructed using the latest technology, and the emissions are compliant with the most stringent Azerbaijani and EU environmental requirements. Ash generated during the incineration process is caught by special filters and does not pollute the environment. Furthermore, after metals are removed and recycled, the bottom ash can be used as material for road construction. Finally, industrial water used for cooling during the waste incineration process is discharged into the sewers after extensive treatment. We also conduct multilevel and functional monitoring, as well as control environmental emissions indicators, on a regular basis. The plant meets ISO 14001 environmental management standards. During the operation of the plant, the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere is reduced significantly, and the expected emission reduction is estimated to reach up to 100,000 tons of CO2 per year. Our Project Design Documents were drafted under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) framework of the Kyoto Protocol, and their registration is currently pending for approval by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change Board.</p><h4>What other waste management and recycling programs have you implemented in Baku city?</h4><p>Another big step toward the improvement of waste disposal management is the Balakhani Material Recovery Facility. The plant's equipment was supplied and installed by Germany's Adelmann and Sutco, respectively. The plant is capable of processing 200,000 tons of municipal waste annually. As a pilot project, it is the first plant of its kind not only in the country, but also in the Caucasus region. As a result of sorting paper, glass, plastic, non-ferrous metal, iron, and other materials, we will reduce the total volume of waste, form a cheap raw materials market, create a background for the establishment of the recycling industry, save energy, and reduce the negative impact on the environment. From every delivery of waste we receive, up to 40% of it is generally recyclable. The sorted materials also supply the Balakhani Industrial Park with raw materials for further recycling. On December 28, 2011, the President signed the Establishment of Balakhani Industrial Park decree, with the main purpose of creating favorable conditions for potential entrepreneurs and investors interested in the recycling industry. We plan to construct internal and external infrastructure at the park in order to increase its attractiveness in terms of green business. New infrastructure and electricity, gas, water, drainage, and communication lines will also be set up in the park. We also plan to provide investment incentives for the residents of the park to further stimulate green businesses.</p><h4>To what degree is public participation playing a role in these processes?</h4><p>The President declared 2010 as the “Year of Ecology," which meant that many new and wide-scale environmental projects were launched. The ecological policy implemented in Azerbaijan aims to ensure sustainable development, protect existing ecosystems and economical potential, and rationally use natural resources. Environmental protection is always at the center of attention in the Azerbaijani government, and fundamental reforms are constantly being carried out. At Tamiz Shahar JSC, we pay more attention to public awareness campaigns. We took and continue to take many different actions in this regard. Our Tamiz Gala project is an example of how we pay more attention to public awareness. Gala is regarded as one of the oldest settlements in Azerbaijan, and it is located in the northeast of the Absheron Peninsula. There are plenty of architectural and archeological monuments in the settlement of Gala and in the surrounding regions. In fact, the first Outdoor Archeological and Ethnographic Museum Complex was established in the territory of Gala's historical and ethnographic reserve through the initiative and support of the Heydar Aliyev Foundation in 2008.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[on-a-venture]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What strategies and decisions led you to start your business in Azerbaijan?<br></h4><p>I participated in the launch of Golden Pay in 2007, one of the first dotcom start-ups in Azerbaijan. At the time, PayPal conducted business all over the world but was not accessible in Azerbaijan. Local companies wanted to start selling via the internet but did not have an online payment mechanism. We started Golden Pay to help bridge this gap. Based on research from other countries in the CIS, we forecasted tremendous growth. However, this forecast did not materialize until now, four years since we went into business. During the summer of 2011, I went to Harvard to learn about venture capital and private equity. I saw how much competition there was among startups at universities and was full of ideas upon return to my home country. However, it was difficult to implement these ideas because there was no system for funding new businesses. We did not have the luxury of being able to ask large corporations for money in exchange for dividends in 10 years' time. This is why that year I started a fund to raise financing from high net-worth individuals and invest in startups.</p><h4>What are some of your main projects?</h4><p>We started with five partners who believed in us and went ahead with our first investment in Sazz, a high-speed internet provider offering WiMax technology. Then, we invested in MultiBon, a retail startup that introduced the first bonus plus cash-back system in Azerbaijan. We also took an equity stake in Vital, a company that connects employers and jobseekers. Partly it does what LinkedIn does; it is more like a solution that enables preliminary candidate selection without the need to arrange travel for interviews. Private equity is a new field in Azerbaijan. To attract entrepreneurs and see the passion behind their ideas, we organized a startup competition in January 2013. This was the first such attempt at creating a platform for sharing knowledge and expertise. Such competitions are held all over the world, but in our country it is a new concept, which means we have to play catch-up. We received positive feedback on these initial efforts. As a fund we want to be present in different sectors and invest in businesses that are innovative and have the potential to become market leaders over time.</p><h4>How do you raise awareness about your fund to potential investors?</h4><p>Initially, we only approached people that we knew well. The more data and success stories we accumulated, the easier it became to establish relationships and build trust. Most of our investors are Azerbaijani business people who live in Baku; some live abroad but have Azerbaijani roots. Over the past two years we significantly strengthened our profile. The fund is now perceived as an alternative investment option with a focus on local enterprise. In 2013, we will be the first private equity firm to operate in Azerbaijan. We would like to look to EU institutions for financing as well. By that time, we should have seven startups in our portfolio.</p><div class="quote">“To attract entrepreneurs and see the passion behind their ideas, we organized a startup competition in January 2013."</div><h4>Is it challenging to attract investment?</h4><p>Finance professionals are familiar with venture capital, but in Azerbaijan most of them are not familiar with technology startups. Sometimes it is difficult to find people who really know what we are doing. Wherever we go, we present what we are doing and raise awareness. The majority of current users of blue chip IT companies such as Facebook, Skype, and LinkedIn are unaware that these were financed by venture capital companies during their prematurity period.</p><h4>How would you describe the current investment climate in the ICT sector?</h4><p>At the end of December 2012, the President signed the Azerbaijan 2020 project decree, which is a comprehensive roadmap for the country's development. The government is looking to increase its economic competitiveness and grow the non-oil sector with ICT playing the leading role in this process. The project is designed to facilitate market deregulation.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[of-mutual-interest]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main trends in the economic development of Azerbaijan throughout 2012?<br></h4><p>Like in previous years, 2012 was a success for Azerbaijan. Despite the global financial crisis of recent years, we have ensured macroeconomic stability, the diversification of the economy, the balanced development of the non-oil sector, and regional acceleration. Measures for the further improvement of the investment climate have continued in the wake of the purposeful policies that have been carried out. In 2012, GDP growth was stable at 2.2%, and the non-oil sector increased by 9.7%. Internal investment amounted to $13.3 billion and foreign investment was at $8.8 billion. Foreign trade turnover rose to $39.5 billion, and non-oil exports increased by 11.2% over this period. Inflation was steady at 1.1%.</p><h4>What are the main strategic priorities to boost GDP growth in Azerbaijan in the coming years?</h4><p>The main distinctive feature of Azerbaijan's economic development over the last few years has been the maintenance of GDP growth within the non-oil sector. The development concept “Azerbaijan 2020: Outlook for the Future" was prepared to ensure the strengthening and sustainability of the achievements attained in the country's economy. The objectives put forward in the concept are increasing the competitiveness of the economy, improving its structure, and developing social spheres and human capital. An export-oriented economic model is one of the tenets of this concept. The improvement of the competitiveness of the economy, the development of the logistics infrastructure for the regions and Baku suburbs, and the expansion of the ICT sector have been set as key strategic directions to increase GDP in the coming years. The Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway project will play a crucial role in the realization of the transit potential of our country and its continued success.</p><h4>The ICT sector of Azerbaijan's economy is now the second largest recipient of foreign investment. What are the other sectors that the government intends to further develop?</h4><p>The non-oil sector of the Azerbaijani economy has great potential for development. The ultimate goal of the economic and social policy is to ensure diversification by using these opportunities efficiently. Measures are being taken to reduce the dependence of the economy on the oil sector, maintain the balanced development of the non-oil sector, use the natural resources and potential of the regions efficiently, combine infrastructure with modern requirements, create a wide range of opportunities for entrepreneurship development, and further improve the investment climate. Industry is one of the leading fields of the Azerbaijani economy. A favorable institutional and investment environment has been created to develop industry and the production capacity of enterprises. In addition, fields such as engineering, chemistry, metallurgy, energy, FMCG, ICT, tourism, transport, and agriculture have great development potential. Azerbaijan has rich deposits of ferrous and non-ferrous metals, rare metal ores, non-metallic raw materials, and construction materials. Moreover, our country has the perfect natural climatic conditions for improving alternative and renewable energy generation systems through utilizing wind, water, and solar energy. As a part of the industrialization policy, modern technoparks, industrial parks, as well as chemical, industrial, and high technology parks in Sumgait and Balakhani are being established.</p><p>Tourism also has great potential in our country because of its history, geographic location, and favorable climatic conditions. In recent years, new modern hotels and resorts have been built in Baku and the surrounding regions. The construction of the Shahdag Summer-Winter Tourism Complex will contribute to the development of skiing and other winter sports in the country. The development of tourism along the Caspian Sea will pave the way for the expansion of tourism services in our country.</p><h4>Which countries are you focusing on to strengthen bilateral and multilateral relations?</h4><p>Integration into the world economy and the expansion of relations with foreign countries and international organizations are key to our socioeconomic development strategy. Delegations from Germany, the Netherlands, the UAE, Hungary, Argentina, Serbia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Slovenia, and Indonesia, as well as many regions of the Russian Federation have attended events hosted by the Ministry of Economic Development in 2012. During these visits, meetings, business forums, and presentations were held, and discussions took place on issues such as the development of economic cooperation, the expansion of trade relations between countries, and reciprocal investment flows. Along with this, we sent large delegations to Turkey, Georgia, Tajikistan, Jordan, China, Hungary, Croatia, and Albania to boost economic relations with partner countries and discuss issues of mutual interest. Bilateral meetings and business forums were organized during the visits. All of these serve to expand Azerbaijan's foreign economic relations, improve commercial affairs and reciprocal investment flow, and establish ties among businessmen.</p><h4>What have been the most significant economic developments in the country over the past decade?</h4><p>I think that successfully implementing a domestic and foreign policy, consistent reforms in the economic sphere, measures on state support for entrepreneurship, and a favorable business and investment climate have all paved the way for Azerbaijan to be known as the leading reformer in the world for its economic development rate. GDP grew by 3.4 times, and the non-oil sector by 2.7 times. The role of the private sector further increased in the country's socioeconomic development, with its share in GDP now constituting 83%, and in the agricultural sector it is up to 100%. More than 1.2 million new jobs have been created since 2003 as a result of the measures taken to eliminate poverty and unemployment. Accordingly, Azerbaijan entered the list of medium-high income countries. Fixed investment increased by seven times, and investments directed to the non-oil sector rose by 18.7 times over the 2003-2012 period. Crucial success has been achieved toward creating economic relations with different countries and boosting foreign trade volume. Today, Azerbaijani products are exported to different countries, including developed countries, and the range of exported products is growing constantly. At present, Azerbaijan cooperates with over 150 countries in the field of trade. Azerbaijan's foreign trade turnover was augmented by seven fold, exports by 10.3 fold, and imports by 3.7 fold between 2004 and 2011. The rapid development of the Azerbaijani economy sparked an increase in the financial capacities of our country and investment in the economies of foreign countries. Azerbaijan has invested billions of dollars in Turkey, Georgia, Russia, Uzbekistan, Ukraine, Romania, and Switzerland. Azerbaijan has become a reliable partner in terms of maintaining the energy security of Europe by turning into an energy exporter from being an importer. The world's major rating agencies—Fitch, Standard &amp; Poor's, and Moody's—upgraded Azerbaijan's credit rating, each granting the country investment grade and grading their prognosis as “stable." Azerbaijan is the first and only country in the region to achieve investment grade. The Global Competitiveness Report 2012-2013 by the World Economic Forum ranked Azerbaijan 46th among 144 economies around the world. Azerbaijan has been holding the leading position amongst CIS countries for four years now. According to the World Bank's 2013 Doing Business report, Azerbaijan ranked 67th among 185 countries on the ease of doing business. It shows once again that the socioeconomic policy comprising development and durability will maintain Azerbaijan's sustainable development and strengthen our country's position in the world.</p><h4>What are the Ministry's medium-term plans to ensure economic sustainability?</h4><p>The directions of development strategies and strategic objectives over the long term have been determined, and the “Azerbaijan-2020: Outlook for the Future" development strategy has been established to reach these objectives. Crucial goals include maintaining a high level of social welfare, turning Azerbaijan into an economically and socially developed country, ensuring sustainable development of the non-oil sector, and further accelerating the sustainable and balanced development of the regions. Another crucial goal includes improving the living conditions of the people, especially strengthening the social protection of those on low incomes. These plans also look to provide the population with communications, internet, banking, and public utility services, as well as roads and high-quality health care and education. We seek to minimize unemployment, reduce the level of poverty, increase the income of the population, and establish the presence of enhanced human capital. In order to realize these goals, measures to improve the structure of the economy, modernize the oil and gas sector and petrochemical industry, diversify and develop the non-oil industry, and expand the opportunities for the use of alternative and renewable energy sources will be taken. We aim to develop the agricultural sector and strengthen food security, boost trade and services, improve the structure of foreign trade and investments, and develop transport, transit, and logistics infrastructure. The 100% application of e-government services in the country will also be the center of attention as the one of the main priorities.</p><p>As the main goal of economic development is the development of social welfare and the improvement of the social sphere, human capital will remain a priority. Enhancing the quality of education and health, strengthening the social protection of the population, ensuring gender equality and family development, and raising the potential of the youth and sports are among the priorities set forth. The preservation of cultural heritage, its effective management and preservation, and the enrichment of new creative solutions for environmental and ecological problems are also key policy targets.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>AZPROMO has been in operation for 10 years. What have been the major achievements of the organization so far?<br></h4><p>The Azerbaijan Export and Investment Promotion Foundation (AZPROMO) was established by the Ministry of Economic Development in 2003 in compliance with the state policy on the diversification of the national economy, the development of its non-oil sector, and integration into the world economic system. Established to promote the country's economic potential and favorable business and investment climate, as well as to expand the business relations of local entrepreneurs, AZPROMO plays an important role in increasing FDI flows and stimulating the expansion of the country's export capacities. One of the major tools we apply to achieve these objectives is the organization of various events such as business forums, business meetings, and roundtables, which offer platforms for establishing new contacts and defining future cooperation opportunities with foreign businesses. In 2012 alone, we organized 308 events abroad and in Azerbaijan, which over 5,000 entrepreneurs attended.</p><h4>Who are Azerbaijan's main export partners, and how would you assess the country's trade balance?</h4><p>Since 2004, the positive balance of foreign trade turnover increased seven fold, while exports grew by 10.3 times. In 2012, our trade turnover was $39.5 billion, while the positive trade balance reached $22.6 billion. This is a direct result of the large qualitative changes in every sector of the Azerbaijani economy, achievements in economic development, the attraction of foreign investment, and the application of modern technology. At the same time, the rapid development of the non-oil sector stimulated the increased number of non-oil exports. Thus, non-oil exports increased by 11.2% in 2012. Our products are known for their high quality and are exported not only to traditional markets, but also to distant countries such as the US, Canada, Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and countries in Africa and Latin America. Our economy is intensively integrating into the world trade and economic system. Azerbaijan has trade relations with over 150 countries worldwide. We are a well-known and reliable partner for many countries in Europe, Asia, and the Americas. Our major export partners are Italy, Israel, Indonesia, India, France, the US, Russia, Germany, and Greece. The largest importers to Azerbaijan are Turkey, Russia, Germany, the US, China, Ukraine, the UK, and Kazakhstan.</p><h4>Given that the ICT sector receives the second largest amount of FDI after oil and gas, how would you assess Azerbaijan's role as a regional ICT hub?</h4><p>The ICT sector continues to expand, modernize, and influence thorough progress. It is one of the fastest-growing and most attractive sectors for investors. We are proud of being a leading economy in the region in terms of ICT development. Against this background, the number of internet and mobile telephony users is growing rapidly. Nowadays, 89.5% of Baku's population uses the internet. In terms of the country as a whole, 65% of the population uses the internet, 30% of which use broadband internet. In addition, President Aliyev has taken certain measures regarding public e-services, which opens up new opportunities for the wider application of e-services in our country. Through his decree, we established the National Certificate Services Center, launched an application for e-signatures, and initiated the Electronic Government Portal to provide a one-stop-shop for state authorities. Furthermore, a Regional Innovation Zone (RIZ) was established in Azerbaijan to promote the production of ICT products, services, and exports. A number of attractive incentives are offered to investors in this zone. Azerbaijan is also an initiator of large regional projects in the field of ICT. For example, the Trans-Eurasia Super Information Highway project will ensure that 20 countries in the region have high-speed internet, modern telecommunications systems, wider e-commerce availability, and additional information resources. Finally, I would like to stress another important project; the development of the space industry and the launching of national satellites. Our first satellite, Azerspace-1, was launched on February 7, 2013. This is one of our major achievements in ICT. According to the World Economic Forum's latest report, Azerbaijan ranks 61st in the world and first in the CIS in terms of growth rates in the ICT sector.</p><div class="quote">“AZPROMO offers a number of free services to foreign investors."</div><h4>What specific services and advantages does AZPROMO offer to current and potential foreign investors?</h4><p>AZPROMO offers a number of free services to foreign investors. Our experts continuously respond to investors' inquiries about current business opportunities, priority sectors, new projects that are interesting for foreign investments, and applicable legislation. We help them identify and find local suppliers. This activity also facilitates the development of sub-contracting, which is very important for SMEs. In addition, I would like to emphasize our assistance to foreign investors willing to invest in Azerbaijan and establish their presence here. All interested parties who apply to AZPROMO receive detailed information about the required documents for business registration, applicable procedures, required licenses, and permits. We guide investors through the whole process of business start-up, from collecting necessary documents to applying to the relevant state authorities and getting registered. At the same time, we promote joint projects and ventures between Azerbaijani and foreign businesses, for which we established a catalogue of investment projects implemented by local businesses willing to attract foreign investors to their activities. We disseminate this catalogue among foreign partners, embassies, state authorities, and international institutions. Furthermore, we offer a number of basic logistics services, such as visa facilitation, matchmaking, meetings, and site visits.</p><h4>What are the main countries AZPROMO operates in and what expansion prospects are on the horizon?</h4><p>There are no geographic limits for us in promoting Azerbaijan's economy and export and investment potential. For instance, in 2012 we organized 308 events and meetings, with the participation of businesses, civil servants, and various institutions from 54 countries, as well as representatives from various international organizations. Taking into account the international events we participated in, where we made country presentations, and to what extent we disseminated our publication materials, our geography is continuing to expand. I would like to stress our work toward the promotion of local non-oil products and exports. There is a huge demand for our products, especially in terms of high-quality agriculture and food products in traditional markets such as the CIS. At the same time, we work intensively to identify and promote non-oil exports to new markets. As a result of our efforts, for instance, products made under the “Made in Azerbaijan" brand are sold at a range of prestigious stores in several parts of the US. When it comes to our expansion prospects, I believe we can widely benefit from the existing opportunities in our non-traditional markets. Against this background, one of AZPROMO's current goals is to seek out new potential markets and take advantage of the opportunities we find. Finally, in order to achieve these goals we established a network of representative offices in foreign countries such as Georgia, Austria, Germany, the US, and the UAE.</p><h4>What have been the major changes to Azerbaijan's investment landscape over the past decade?</h4><p>President Aliyev has preserved and strengthened the country's political and macroeconomic stability. In addition, our economic potential has significantly increased, and a favorable and attractive investment climate was formed in the country. As a result of the President's sustainable, durable, well thought-out, and future-oriented economic policy, our economy grew at high rates and continues to develop successfully. Due to the implementation of the state programs and strategies based on this policy, more than 1.1 million new jobs have been created, the poverty level fell to 6%, and thousands of new enterprises were established. Our economy is the biggest in the South Caucasus and its share in the regional economy is over 70%. The economy of Azerbaijan is steadily growing. Record GDP growth of 34.5% was recorded in 2006. Even during the global financial crisis, we were able to maintain a positive growth rate of development. Our non-oil GDP is following this positive tendency and grew by 9.4% in 2011 and 9.7% in 2012. Its development plays a direct and driving role in the overall development of the economy at large. According to research from The Economist, the Azerbaijani economy was the second-fastest growing among 179 countries in terms of GDP per-capita growth rates in the first decade of the 21st century. Entrepreneurship development is a priority matter in our economy. We have applied different measures such as developing state-to-business relations, improving legislation and administrative procedures related to the business and investment climate, strengthening the mechanisms of state support to entrepreneurs, promoting education, developing business-to-business relations, and offering various services. The institutional framework for these measures has been strengthened through AZPROMO and the Azerbaijan Investment Company, which is attached to the Ministry of Economic Development. Azerbaijan has a favorable environment for the development of competitive industrial production on the basis of innovative high technology. In order to stimulate this, and to help entrepreneurship as well as to ensure strengthened science and industrial potential and to increase the employment rate, Sumgait Chemical Industrial Park and Balakhani Industrial Park were established in 2011. Additionally, the High Technologies Park was established in the city of Sumgait in 2012. Of course, these economic achievements have been accompanied by serious legal reforms. Legal, administrative, and institutional factors are also important for the investment climate and much has been done in this field. The legislative framework has been improved, administrative procedures have been simplified, and institutional reforms have been implemented.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Looking back over your years as President, what developments are you most proud of?</h4><p>The last 10 years have been an important period of dynamic socioeconomic development and a stage of democratic and modern state building in Azerbaijan. While relying on strong popular support, we have made great achievements by following the political course of our national leader Heydar Aliyev, who established strong public and political stability and laid the foundation of economic reforms. Numerous state programs outlining both the general direction of the country's development and the specific work to be done in all areas that have been adopted and successfully implemented. These activities have had an important impact on the socioeconomic development of the country, improved the well being of the population, and facilitated the solution of other problems facing our citizens. The launch of Azerbaijan's new oil strategy has opened up extensive opportunities for the implementation of all our future plans. The launch of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) oil pipeline in 2006, and the Baku-Tbilisi-Erzurum gas pipeline after that, ushered in the renewal and diversification of Caspian hydrocarbon export infrastructure, and secured the direct access of Azerbaijani oil and gas to world markets. These have become landmark events—not only for the past 10 years, but also in the years of Azerbaijan's independence in general.</p><p>Over the last 10 years we have diversified and tripled the range of our economy, created a modern social and economic infrastructure, and secured the dynamic development of the non-oil sector. In 2003, our state budget was $1.5 billion, while in 2013 we increased it to $25 billion. More than 1 million jobs have been created in the country, while the level of unemployment has dropped to 5.1%. Although the poverty rate in 2003 in Azerbaijan was 49%, we successfully brought it down to 6% in 2012. This is one of the highest indicators related to poverty reduction in the world. A total of $140 billion has been invested in the Azerbaijani economy, while the country's exchange reserves are in excess of $46 billion.</p><p>During the 2005-2009 period, Azerbaijan was a leading country in the world for its rate of economic development, and it completed the period of its economic transition. Starting from 2009, our focus has been on reducing the country's dependence on oil, and the dynamics of the last three years show that we have achieved this goal. At the present time, we maintain stable oil production, and we have secured the country's economic development largely by means of the non-oil sector. As a matter of fact, the Azerbaijani economy registered 9% growth even in 2009, the year when the global financial recession began. Although oil production in Azerbaijan slightly declined in 2012, GDP increased by 2.2%, while the non-oil sector grew by about 10%. The non-oil sector has expanded twice in the last eight years, and grew by 8% in 2012.</p><p>It is a well-known fact that a number of countries in the world are currently experiencing major financial constraints and have to borrow extensively in an effort to prevent the trend of economic decline. In some countries, for example Armenia, public debt is approaching 50% of GDP and this situation is expected to gradually be further aggravated. In Azerbaijan, public debt accounts for only 7%-8% of GDP, one of the lowest indicators of this nature in the world.</p><p>As a result of the implementation of important state programs and large-scale infrastructure projects, the appearance of cities, villages, and settlements across the Republic has changed beyond recognition, while the living standards of the population have dramatically improved. By implementing programs for the socioeconomic development of districts, we have managed to eliminate the gap in the level of development between the capital and the countryside. We have achieved major progress in the social sphere in Azerbaijan. More than 2,500 schools meeting contemporary requirements, hundreds of healthcare institutions, and numerous sports and social infrastructure facilities have been put into operation in the last 10 years. Salaries and social benefits have been regularly increased, and this policy will be continued in the future as well. In addition, in 2012 we started a process for the payment of compensation for deposits left in Soviet savings banks. It is worth mentioning that Azerbaijan is the only country of the former Soviet Union to repay these deposits over a short period of time and with a high interest rate.</p><p>As is known, 20% of Azerbaijani territory has been occupied as a result of Armenian aggression. More than 1 million people have become refugees or internally displaced, living in extremely unfavorable conditions such as tent-camps and places not suitable for habitation. In 2004, we began to take serious steps to improve the plight of internally displaced people. Over this period, all the tent-camps have been eliminated, 77 modern settlements have been built, and the living conditions of hundreds of thousands of internally displaced people have been improved. In 2012 alone, we provided 20,000 internally displaced persons with modern apartments and houses. Another 20,000 people will be provided with new residences over 2013.</p><p>Over these years, we have successfully implemented the country's security strategy. First and foremost, we have ensured the energy security of Azerbaijan and eliminated the country's dependence on foreign energy. Today, Azerbaijan is a country contributing to the energy security of both the region and Europe, and the country is an important player in the global energy market. Azerbaijan's contribution to the gas market of several European countries has increased to 40%. Starting from 2017, after the implementation of the TANAP project, which was initiated by Azerbaijan and is being realized jointly with Turkey, the country's role in the natural gas market of Europe will further increase. This project is expected to become a major contributor to our long-term development and will secure Azerbaijan's economic and other interests for decades to come.</p><p>Taking into consideration the occupation of Azerbaijani territories in the aftermath of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh, we see the strengthening of the army as one of our priority objectives. Today, the Azerbaijani army is the strongest army in the South Caucasus in terms of its material and technical capacity, weaponry and ammunition, discipline, and combat readiness. We have established the Ministry of Defense Industry in Azerbaijan, launched several military industry enterprises, and are currently producing over 700 military commodities.</p><p>Azerbaijan is currently the leading country in the region from the standpoint of its economic potential. Our economy accounts for more than 80% of the South Caucasus economy. We have become a country with a sustainable economy. It is possible to say with full confidence that we have accomplished everything we planned in 2003. The world's leading economic and financial institutions are currently giving a high assessment of Azerbaijan's successes. We are ranked in leading positions in all international reports. While the world's leading rating agencies such as Fitch, Moody's, and Standard and Poor's have downgraded the credit ratings of most developed countries, our rating has been upgraded. Azerbaijan has advanced into the category of countries with “high human development" according to a report from the UN Development Program. The Global Competitiveness report from the World Economic Forum rates Azerbaijan as the 46th country in the world and first in the CIS. The decision was made in 2012 to hold a session of the Davos Economic Forum in Azerbaijan in 2013. This is evidence of the fact that the international community recognizes Azerbaijan's economic achievements.</p><p>Obviously, the list of achievements over the last 10 years, for which our people can be proud of, is very extensive. It was in 2011 that Azerbaijan was elected a member of the UN Security Council for the first time in its history, despite tough competition. In May 2012, our country presided over the organization. I believe that this has been an international assessment of our country's sustainable development through our years of independence, an indicator of the respect Azerbaijan has earned globally, and recognition of our contribution to global security.</p><p>Azerbaijan has turned into a platform of dialogue between civilizations, a center of multiculturalism, and a venue for the discussion of pressing political, economic, humanitarian, and other issues. In 2011, we organized the Global Forum on Intercultural Dialogue, thus elevating the initiatives implemented by Azerbaijan on the regional scale onto the global level. The Baku International Humanitarian Forum, which is annually attended by heads of states and governments, Nobel Prize laureates, and internationally renowned public and political figures, has already become a tradition. In 2011, Azerbaijan won Europe's top music competition, the Eurovision Song Contest, while in 2012 we successfully hosted this competition in Baku, thus demonstrating our great potential to the world.</p><p>The Seventh UN Forum on Internet Governance was held in Baku in 2012. The fact that this forum was held in Azerbaijan was no coincidence, as the ICT sector is rapidly developing to become the most promising segment of our economy. In fact, 2013 was declared “The Year of ICT" in Azerbaijan.</p><p>On February 8, 2013, Azerbaijan launched its first telecommunications satellite into orbit. It was a very significant and historic day, and a major achievement for our country. The decision to put an Azerbaijani satellite into orbit was made in 2008. In 2009, we adopted a relevant state program, Azerkosmos JSC was established in 2010. The results we have achieved show that Azerbaijan is indeed a rapidly and comprehensively developing country today. Two more satellites will be launched into orbit in 2015 and 2016, which will create excellent opportunities for the development of the space industry in Azerbaijan. The development of new technology, in particular the ICT sector, has become a hallmark of Azerbaijan and will facilitate our successful development in the future.</p><p>Over past decade, Azerbaijan has successfully hosted a number of globally important political, economic, cultural, sporting, and other events. In addition to that, the European Olympic Committee's decision to conduct the inaugural 2015 European Olympic Games in Azerbaijan is not only a historic achievement and a huge success for our country, but it is also evidence of Azerbaijan's growing international authority and a recognition of our extensive opportunities on the part of the international community.</p><p>In parallel with this, democratic reforms are being continued and a strong civil society has emerged in Azerbaijan. Today, Azerbaijan is a country where freedom of expression, speech, and the media are guaranteed. People and the prosperity of our nation are at the heart of all our policies. All of our steps and work serve the interests of the people of Azerbaijan. Of course, we could not implement such gigantic plans without the confidence and support of our people.</p><h4>Regarding the upcoming election, what can you say about the future of the country and the key policies you intend to implement?</h4><p>More than 20 years ago, Azerbaijan freed itself from a totalitarian system and has been on the path of democratic state building ever since. At the sensitive time when our Republic had just regained its independence, it was vitally important for our people who and what force would come to power in Azerbaijan. The bitter experience of the early 1990s shows that the rise to power of completely accidental people, unaware of their responsibility for public administration, can lead to tragedy and expose the state to serious problems. The people of Azerbaijan are very wise and have always been able to make the right decision at crucial times in their history. When our statehood was faced with the imminent threat of destruction in 1993, our people stood up and invited national leader Heydar Aliyev, who had tremendous experience in public administration, to power. The consistent implementation of the development strategy laid down by Heydar Aliyev for over 20 years has secured our dynamic development and transformed Azerbaijan into a modern and democratic country on the world map.</p><p>There are certain unchangeable principles of building a modern and democratic state, a system of values that are consistently secured, and main strategic goals that are always protected. I am absolutely convinced that the course toward building an independent state, democratic development, social prosperity, and civil society laid down by Heydar Aliyev must continue in Azerbaijan. Of course, the top priority of this policy is that Azerbaijan should stand among the most developed countries of the world, be competitive, restore its territorial integrity, and be an independent, strong, and democratic state.</p><h4>Given the important geostrategic location of Azerbaijan, how would you describe the country's relations with Russia, Turkey, and other neighboring nations?</h4><p>Azerbaijan is a reliable partner that has its own position on any issue and pursues a completely independent policy. With the exception of Armenia, we build our relations with countries in the region and the world on the basis of the principles of effective cooperation, mutual respect, and non-interference in each other's affairs. It was on these principles that Azerbaijan joined the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) in 2012, thus identifying new vectors of the country's foreign policy. As with any other country in the world, we are currently working to strengthen our relations with African and Latin American countries and establish new partnerships.</p><p>The development of relations with regional countries remains a priority direction of our foreign policy. Turkey is a friendly and brotherly country and a strategic ally for Azerbaijan. The transnational projects implemented by Azerbaijan's initiative in recent years, as well as mutual investment projects, have brought our countries even closer together. We are currently implementing a project on the construction of a petrochemical and refinery complex in Turkey worth $17 billion. Azerbaijan's major energy projects enhance the importance of Turkey as a transit country and a contributor to European energy security.</p><p>As was the case in previous years, our relations with Russia are also rapidly developing. Our relations have assumed the nature of a strategic partnership. Political dialogue, humanitarian cooperation, the strengthening of economic relations, and collaboration on other issues form the core of our bilateral agenda. Russia is in first place for the volume of imports to Azerbaijan. At the same time, Russia is an important market for our agricultural produce. We have recently started to invest in real estate and the shares of major commercial entities in Russia. Azerbaijani companies are also implementing projects in the area of agricultural produce processing in Russia, for example.</p><p>Furthermore, Azerbaijan is developing friendly and sincere relations with other countries in the region. We are guided by the interests of the Azerbaijani people and the state in bilateral and multilateral relations.</p><h4>The year 2012 was declared “Year of Sports." Reflecting on Azerbaijan's achievements at the Olympic Games in London 2012, the hosting of the FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup, and the election of Baku to host the inaugural European Olympic Games in 2015, how would you evaluate this past year?</h4><p>Our achievements in the field of sports in 2012 gives us the opportunity to talk about the results of the “Year of Sports" with a sense of great pride. When making this decision at the beginning of 2012, we wanted our athletes to win and to succeed, and they have lived up to our expectations. Our athletes have successfully represented our country in international competitions, winning a total of over 700 medals in various tournaments, including 255 gold medals. About 300 international sports events have been held in Azerbaijan in the last 10 years. Of these, I want to particularly highlight the FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup, because it was a new and very successful experience for us. Both FIFA and UEFA have given a very high assessment of the organization of the World Cup in Azerbaijan. In 2013, we marked the 20th anniversary of the National Olympic Committee. Azerbaijan has been a member of the international Olympic family for 20 years now. The historic results of our athletes at the London Olympic Games in 2012 are further evidence of the fact that our country is already a full-fledged member of this family. Our athletes have won 10 medals at the Olympics, including two gold, two silver, and six bronze. We finished in 30th place in the world, in 15th among European nations, and in third among Muslim countries.</p><p>Finally, on December 8, 2012, a session of the General Assembly of the European Olympic Committee held in Rome decided to conduct the inaugural European Olympic Games in 2015 in Baku. I believe that this is a historic decision. Historically, the Olympic Games originated in Europe, but the European Olympic Games have never been held before. The decision to conduct the first European Olympic Games is in itself a very serious step, a watershed in the Olympic movement. It is a tremendous responsibility for us to host Europe's first Olympics, but it is also a high assessment on the part of the international and European Olympic movement of the work being done in our country, including our achievements in the field of sports. The ever-growing international authority of Azerbaijan, the country's economic power and dynamic development, the modern social, economic, and cultural infrastructure, the existing public and political stability, and the popular support for the reforms being implemented have played an important part in the adoption of this decision.</p><p>However, we had started to create a modern sports infrastructure suitable for conducting important international competitions in Azerbaijan long before the decision was made. In 2012, these activities were continued and two more regional Olympic centers were commissioned, bringing the total number of Olympic centers in the country to 35. Eight other centers are currently under construction and there are plans to build several more. New sports facilities have been built and put into operation in Baku. The country's central stadium has been renovated in accordance with international standards. Another stadium has also been commissioned. The construction of a large Gymnastics Center and an Aquatic Palace is currently under way. In 2012, we laid the foundation for the Olympic stadium, which will be the largest stadium in the region. I am absolutely sure that the infrastructure and technical and organizational issues will be successfully resolved for the inaugural European Olympic Games in 2015. I would also like to note that host countries are usually allowed six to seven years to prepare for the Olympic Games, but we have only two years to go. This is why we have already started to take the necessary actions. On January 17, 2013, we established the Organizing Committee for the First European Olympic Games, which held its first meeting on February 2, and discussed future objectives and tasks. I am sure that all relevant organizations will do their best to conduct the Games at a high level and we, as ever, will demonstrate the power of our country, the hospitality of our people, and the dynamic development of Azerbaijan to Europe and the world.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess UK-Azerbaijan trade relations?<br></h4><p>The UK government places a great deal of importance on trade relations with Azerbaijan. Although Azerbaijan is a young country, it has an increasing presence on the international stage and I am proud to say that the UK is a friend and strategic partner of Azerbaijan. However, our relations go back much further than you may think. In fact, the first British businessman is said to have visited Baku 500 years ago, and I'm pleased to say that today British firms are the principal foreign investors in Azerbaijan, making up 50% of all FDI. The shared benefits of this cooperation are clear. Fast-developing economies like Azerbaijan are vital drivers for growth, and UK expertise and industry has been helping modernize and develop many sectors, including oil and gas and infrastructure. Azerbaijan is making a significant push to develop its IT sector, and we're also involved in developing this area. Our relations are underpinned by trade, but the scope of our relationship is widening all the time.</p><h4>Does the energy sector play the largest part in this relationship?</h4><p>Absolutely. With BP at the forefront, the UK has strong business links with Azerbaijani companies in the energy sector and related services. UK companies have invested over $25 billion in Azerbaijan. However, there is so much more to Azerbaijan than energy. Of course, Azerbaijan will want to exploit the opportunities that its wealth in energy resources brings, but at the same time I am pleased to see that Azerbaijan is looking to the future and realizes the need to diversify its economy on more sustainable ground.</p><h4>What opportunities are there for UK companies outside of the energy sector?</h4><p>There are over 120 UK businesses operating in Azerbaijan. There are many strengths and interests that the UK and Azerbaijan share and should build on. While trade between our countries has grown in recent years, speaking to business people in the UK, I am convinced that this can grow further and farther than it has so far. There are many business opportunities that neither one of us is taking advantage of. I would like to see more of our companies, especially our SMEs, doing business with each other. The UK has a powerful and diverse brand and no matter where we are in the world, our products are always associated with high quality, whether it be in fashion or education. As Azerbaijan prospers from its natural resources, its citizens are increasingly looking to purchase higher-end goods and services, and this is an area where we see UK-based companies moving. We are already seeing growth in the retail sector, with a particular focus on luxury brands and well-known household names. UK retail outlets currently in Azerbaijan include Burberry, Mothercare, Debenhams, and Accessorize. There is also increasing interest in the education sector, both from UK universities and Azerbaijani students. The UK has some of the finest schools and universities in the world, and I am pleased to see that the number of applications from Azerbaijan has doubled in the past couple of years. Both Heriot Watt University and Nottingham Trent University have a significant presence in Azerbaijan. Other priority sectors for UK companies are in financial services, construction management, and design. The challenge for us now is to build on what has been achieved so far and further strengthen our business links, because there is so much for both of our countries to gain.</p><h4>What impact did the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympics Games have on the UK's reputation abroad?</h4><p>The Olympics and Paralympics were a very proud moment for the people of London and the UK. It was not only an opportunity to showcase British sporting ability, but also an opportunity to promote the UK as a place to visit, work, and study. I am delighted that Azerbaijan has been selected to host the inaugural European Games in summer 2015. While much of the necessary infrastructure is already in place or under contract, there are still likely to be opportunities in sports consultancy and communications. Given the experience of the London 2012 Olympics and Paralympics, there will be many UK companies well placed to compete. I know that the Head of the British Olympic Association, Lord Sebastian Coe, has already visited Baku to congratulate Azerbaijan on its success and discuss areas for further cooperation. However, with all this attention on Azerbaijan, it is inevitable that the world will look closely at the country's progress across a broad range of issues. There is still some way to go to convince a large number of UK companies to invest confidently in Azerbaijan. I hope that Azerbaijan will continue to improve its business climate, enticing yet more UK companies to invest in a country with huge potential.</p>]]></richbody0content>

Our subsidiary, Renaissance Construction Azerbaijan, which performs large-scale projects in the private and governmental sectors, helps us to implement the latest techniques as well as cutting-edge technology. Meanwhile, construction and IT are among the most successful of our businesses and are of great importance to Synergy Group. In parallel with that, we are also constantly assessing new opportunities for further expansion, and therefore we are planning to enter the financial market in the near future.</p><h4>What impact has Eurovision, the U-17 UEFA cup, and other international events in 2012 had on hotel occupancy?</h4><p>It is obvious that such major international events positively influence the tourism and hospitality sectors, enabling growth and development. At the same time, they create brilliant opportunities to increase the country's visibility worldwide and to bring in tourist flows, which not only has a positive impact on economic development but also on Azerbaijan's recognition as a country with a unique tourism brand. We have been operating hotels in the region of Nabran and Naftalan, and we strongly believe that Azerbaijan has all the opportunities to provide leisure activities for both foreign visitors and the local market. Setting the example, Renaissance Construction Azerbaijan is currently working on the construction of Qala Altı Hotel Spa &amp; Resort in Shabran, a five-star hotel in Shamkir, and projects in Sheki and Lenkoran. These are illustrations of our projects aimed at the development of tourism in Azerbaijan.</p><div class="quote">“Synergy Group is now expanding its IT business by transferring our know-how to the Central Asian market."</div><h4>In terms of the construction materials industry, Synergy Group is rapidly developing its direction. Can you outline the priorities?</h4><p>Overall, 2012 has been very successful for Synergy Group subsidiary AAC, which was the first company in Azerbaijan and the Caucasus region to produce cellular aero concrete. This unique product, which has fundamentally changed the technology and timing of construction work, has already been in great demand in the EU over the last few years. In Azerbaijan, it is being produced by AAC under the brand name Gobustone, which has excellent sound-insulating and high energy-saving properties. Therefore, we are proud to state that AAC is a pioneer in the production of aero concrete in the local and regional markets, and it is already exporting its products to countries around the CIS. When choosing technology, we thoroughly take into account the environmental impact as well as economic effect. We are constantly developing new methods and technologies, and strive to expand the scope of our activities. Benefiting from our best expertise, we are proud to be a supplier of major construction sites for Pasha Construction, which is building Port Baku Towers and Residence, the 28 May Shopping Mall, the National Gymnastics Academy in Baku, as well as the Shahdag Summer-Winter Tourism Complex. Among our customers is ZQAN Holding, with large-scale construction projects, such as the Rixos Hotel in Guba and the Trump Tower in Baku.</p><h4>The ICT sector is the recipient of the largest amount of non-oil FDI. Is Synergy Group benefiting from those investments?</h4><p>Today, we can firmly state that our IT company CyberNet, which has been a technology development leader since its establishment in 2004, is one of our most successful businesses. CyberNet laid the foundation and presently leads a number of IT projects, which benefits both the public and private sectors. The Automated Tax Information System (AVIS), a one-stop shop for business registration, e-tax services for entrepreneurs, e-tax auditing, the information system of the cadaster of immovable property, the automated documentation system for the State Committee of Property, as well as the e-government information system for the Ministry of Communication and Information Technologies are just a few examples of the many successful projects developed by CyberNet. It goes without saying that there are a number of other major projects that we have implemented for the government and private sector institutions that have had a significant impact on the ease of doing business in Azerbaijan. Synergy Group is now expanding its IT business by transferring our know-how to the Central Asian market.</p><h4>How would you characterize the current investment climate in Azerbaijan? Is it likely to change during the 2013 Presidential elections?</h4><p>Due to the strategic view of the President of Azerbaijan, a favorable investment climate was created in the country. This in turn paved the way for billions of dollars to flow into the country's economy. Moreover, wise and consistent efforts are being made by the state's leadership to develop the non-oil sector, which will foster opportunities for small-, medium-, and large-scale businesses. This ensures the sustainable growth of the economy and lays the foundations for the prosperous life of future generations. Synergy Group clearly illustrates one of many examples of successful companies that enjoy the well-established investment climate in Azerbaijan.</p><h4>How would you describe the changes in Azerbaijan's business landscape over the last 10 years?</h4><p>The regulatory environment in Azerbaijan has undergone significant positive changes over the last decade. A number of reforms have been made and some are underway in the field of business registration, as well as access to finance, tax administration, and business permit and license acquisitions. As a result, Azerbaijan was ranked as a top reformer in the ease of doing business according to the World Bank's Doing Business report. This clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of the existing business environment, and is recognition of the reforms by international financial institutions.</p><h4>Looking forward to 2013, what are your business objectives for the Synergy Group?</h4><p>In addition to our Business Development Strategy for 2013-2015, we aim to become a solid market player as a private equity company with a key focus on construction and the production of construction materials, IT, and agribusiness. We have all the necessary expertise and resources to make this goal happen. Being a rapidly growing company, we highly value the core basis of our success; our people. The growth of the business has set the company the task of ensuring that we have a team ready for change, rather than being merely reactive. In a one-year perspective, we aim to work in a way that will enable Synergy Group, with its diversified business portfolio, to be a smart example of successful business management.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Norway is very pleased with the close relationship that has developed between our countries in the energy sphere and the increasingly close cooperation between Statoil and the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR). The Norwegian supply industry has also made substantial deliveries to projects in the Caspian Sea area. The Caspian region plays an increasingly important role in the world energy market. Azerbaijan has long proven itself to be a reliable and important partner as a producer of oil and gas, and our two countries share the ambition of being reliable suppliers of energy to Europe. Azerbaijan has a key role to play as the enabler of the Southern Gas Corridor, which will link the Caspian region even closer to Europe. Norway fully supports the Southern Gas Corridor, which will further enhance Europe's supply security. The corridor is important to many European countries.</p><p>Azerbaijan's oil history dates back as far as the 1840s, and Norway's experience goes back to the late 1960s. Statoil was among the first international oil companies to invest in Azerbaijan when independence was re-established and international oil companies were invited in. Both Azerbaijan and Norway face the challenge of making sure that our energy resources are managed in a sustainable manner. We must ensure that the resources will also benefit our children and grandchildren, thus taking a long-term perspective in resource management.</p><p>To reflect on the situation of Azerbaijan based on Norway's own experience, I believe that when a substantial part of the national income is generated by oil and gas exports, it is particularly important that we have clear and transparent rules and practices governing both the extraction of resources and the handling of the revenues generated. Too many countries have experienced the so-called “resource curse," where short-lived money flows have led to massive social disparities, inflated spending, and a lack of control of a vital national reserve. Hence, our joint focus on the need for long-term strategies, environmental responsibility, and transparency is crucial. Azerbaijan's focus on the environment and the establishment of a national oil fund is commendable. Norway also hopes to see a continued dialogue on other topics for the mutual benefit of our two nations, such as regional stability, security, human rights, and democracy.</p><div class="quote">“Both Azerbaijan and Norway face the challenge of making sure that our energy resources are managed in a sustainable manner."</div><p>I am pleased about Norway's cooperation with Azerbaijan in the framework of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), where countries and companies work together to promote transparency, accountability, and good governance. We commend Azerbaijan for embracing this initiative at a very early stage and for setting an important example.</p><p>It is also worth mentioning the growing importance of being attached to corporate social responsibility. Governments, commercial entities, and civil societies all have important roles to play in creating a solid basis of sustainable development for the benefit of the entire society. Azerbaijan's role in the global energy market is already important, and its role is set to become even more significant in the future. I hope to see the mutually beneficial partnership between Azerbaijan and Norway develop in the years to come, both in the energy sphere and in other areas.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you rate development in the agriculture sector in the Dominican Republic, and what role does the Food &amp; Agriculture Organization (FAO) play?<br></h4><p>In terms of production, the agriculture sector has had its ups and downs over the years due to changeable weather conditions in the Dominican Republic. Around 70% of farms are small-scale producers, and crops are mainly rain fed. The sector does, however, combine some old techniques with advanced technology. In general, rice and vegetables production incorporates advanced technology, and beans and corn use old technology. Over the last few years we have seen a shift toward organic crop varieties. These have begun to gain weight in the country's overall production basket, especially in terms of organic bananas. The Dominican Republic is the leading exporter of this product worldwide, and our main markets are Europe and the US. In this regard, FAO and other international organizations like the UN are implementing a plan to strengthen organic banana production in the country. For example, we are conducting research and launching a pilot project to determine the best irrigation system for this type of crop, and now we are focusing on how to make such technology available to small- and medium-sized producers. Also, FAO aims to strengthen the position of organic bananas by providing the product with value-added in order to make it more competitive on the international stage. Another of our main projects has to do with agricultural diversification, so farmers do not depend on one type of crop.</p><h4>What is behind the success of organic farming in the country?</h4><p>We have learned how to  work closely with farmers and to advise them, but at the same time to listen to their worries and needs. That has enabled us to better target the demands of big markets like Europe. In addition, the introduction of advanced technology in the sector has added competitive value. Before, farmers used to focus on producing crops through old methods without paying attention to market demands, and fortunately we have achieved a mindset and cultural change in this field. Overall, I believe that it is a vital strategy to follow, especially when it comes to small-scale producers who now tend to look for synergies with other producers through the creation of a small network in the production chain.</p><h4>What value-added is FAO working on promoting within the organic farming segment?</h4><p>We believe that by increasing agribusiness competitiveness and trying to provide lower-income families access to essential products, we can add value to Dominican products like cocoa, coffee, and bananas. However, I would like to stress that FAO is mostly focusing on providing advice and expertise to small-scale producers, because in the banana and coffee industries, which are very important for the national economy, there is an entire network of associations that unite efforts in order to provide much-needed strength to products in international markets.</p><h4>What needs to be done to improve the livestock and fisheries industries?</h4><p>The livestock sector, especially the milk production segment, still depends very much on international markets and their evolution. However, there has been a very positive evolution over the last 10 years, and figures show that we have gone from producing 400 million liters of milk per year to 688 million liters, according to public data. The increase has been 72% in a decade, which means a more-than-100% increase in overall milk production figures at the national level. The country currently imports 70% of its meat and fish needs. The fishing industry is suffering from a lack of new technology and investment, and it has yet to be fully developed. In addition, the country needs to work on the quality of its production in these two particular areas. For all that to happen, the country needs to attract much-needed FDI and expertise, because these industries hold huge potential but lack the economic resources.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In 2012 the first heart transplant was performed in the Dominican Republic. How important a milestone is this for the country's health system?<br></h4><p>Completion of the first heart transplant in the country represents proof of the evolution of the ability of Dominican cardiovascular medicine to provide medical care. On the one hand, this fact proves the technological development that has been achieved, but on the other hand it reveals the lack of a national policy regarding the sustainability and implementation of an enduring heart transplant program. A successful transplant program in emerging economies requires government involvement to ensure its continuity.</p><h4>When will CEDIMAT's cardiovascular medicine center be operational, and what means will it have?</h4><p>The center will be operational in January 2014. The center will consist of seven floors, 150 beds, and diagnostic, therapeutic, and surgical procedures will be performed there. The center is already considered one of the most advanced in Latin America in this specialty and others, and the blueprints have been certified to international standards. We will perform a type of medicine that will give the country a great boost to assert itself in the medical tourism field.</p><h4>How have you been sourcing specialists for the center?</h4><p>In terms of human resources, we already have a good team of medical specialists, but we are also training personnel in France, Spain, and the US. They will be joining the center once it starts operations. We also have proposals from foreign doctors who want to work at the center, and we will also have them working with us. The most important thing is that Cedimat has served as a magnet so that Dominican professionals abroad choose to return to the Dominican Republic to practice their professions. The main reason is that at CEDIMAT, they find the same technology, the same working conditions, and the same scientific environment to develop their specialties as they have been doing in developed countries.</p><h4>CEDIMAT has a telemedicine system permanently linked to Massachusetts General Hospital. How important is it for CEDIMAT to have an open line of communication with such a prestigious US institution?</h4><p>It is extremely important because our doctors can teleconference regarding a patient and take advantage of this medium as a means of training. Our operating rooms have a telemedicine system that allows us to consult with doctors from other hospitals located around the world. For example, a doctor from the Massachusetts General Hospital can participate live in a surgery being performed at CEDIMAT. Similarly, we do teleconferences with other medical centers in the country, during which personnel can interact, discuss medical cases, and even participate remotely in a surgery. This system is extremely important to keep doctors up to date, and it benefits patients as several specialists may be intervening simultaneously in a medical procedure from different locations.</p><h4>What potential do you see for the development of medical tourism in the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>The Dominican Republic has great potential to develop medical tourism, but so far it is in its early stages because there is no state policy to develop it. The initiative should have its origin in breakthrough policies in this new tourism model coming from the Ministry of Tourism. Medical tourism is a new opportunity for the Dominican Republic because we have great comparative advantages, such as our proximity to developed countries like the US and Canada, with the former having a large number of uninsured citizens and high medical costs. It is estimated that in the US there are about 40 million people without insurance, and medical service costs are among the highest in the world. The proximity to the Dominican Republic would allow us to capture a percentage of this market, which could come here instead of going to India, for example, which is much further away. In addition, the country has extraordinary access infrastructure with seven international airports and sophisticated communication systems, as well as a high-quality hotel industry.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has this country contributed to the growth of Globalia over the years?<br></h4><p>Overall, it has been a very successful story with a lot of satisfaction, much effort, and many investments. We have a large corporate structure in the Dominican Republic and 4,000 employees, for whom I would do absolutely everything. Over the years, we have reached an investment level of around $400 million.</p><h4>The Dominican Republic in particular, and the Caribbean region in general, is the main destination for 14% of Air Europa's international passengers. What are the future prospects regarding these touristic destinations?</h4><p>Air Europa will maintain its daily flights from Madrid to both Santo Domingo and Punta Cana, as well as some other specific flights to Puerto Plata. Currently, we are analyzing and exploring the possibility of diverting some of our operations to La Romana.</p><h4>What will the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner bring to the company's fleet?</h4><p>It will be part of a unique experience for our customers traveling to and from the Dominican Republic. The Boeing 787 Dreamliner is considered the plane of the future; it is much more comfortable, quieter, and consumes 30% less fuel. When traveling on it, passengers should be reminded that they are certainly traveling in the most modern aircraft available on the market. At least two of the eight such aircraft that the company owns will be flying between the EU and the Dominican Republic.</p><h4>Air Europa started flying to Puerto Plata in June 2011. What are your future expectations for this destination, and how would you assess the results up until now?</h4><p>We have high hopes about Puerto Plata's present and future. We own two hotels that are practically new, with the most advanced technology and modern settings, and we currently have direct flights to Puerto Plata from Madrid. We are putting great efforts into internationally promoting Puerto Plata through our Travelplan network and Halcón Viajes, as well as through tour operators in the US, Venezuela, Puerto Rico, and basically all the countries where we work. I must say that it is not an easy task, for the competition is tough.</p><h4>Be Live Hotels, the group's hospitality chain, launched a tour around several American countries in 2011 to present its new image in the Caribbean. Which countries do you focus your efforts on?</h4><p>Our image is currently associated with quality and the perception that our hotels transmit feelings and sensations, as well as the culture of the country where we operate. Currently, our investment in hotels is greatly focused on the Dominican Republic, a country where we own establishments. Elsewhere in the Americas and the Caribbean region, we only manage the hotels.</p><h4>Do you think the franchise business model can work well in the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>My answer is clear; why not? We would be delighted to franchise the brand under high-quality standards. We would have higher commercial volumes, and applying economies of scale, we would certainly be more competitive.</p><h4>In your opinion, what are the main competitive advantages of the Dominican Republic as a destination compared to its tourism competitors?</h4><p>The Dominican Republic is a sweet and kind country, in which everybody is looking for the best way to assist you. And they do so with sympathy and really good work. That already makes the country stand out when compared to other destinations. In addition, visitors can enjoy beautiful beaches and landscapes, and soon there will also be a good motorway network. In my opinion, it is an ideal country that lies only four hours away from the US by plane. I believe that it certainly has a bright and promising future ahead.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What steps has Al Fahim Group taken to attain its current position in the UAE automotive industry?</h4><p>The late Abdul Jalil Al Fahim (mercy upon him), my father and the founder of AlFahim Group, left strong values that have guided us toward making the right decisions. These values include substance, foresight, humanity, honesty, and we have recently added innovation. These values have guided investment in flagship facilities and a focus on our staff and customers that ensure we deliver excellent products and services across all our businesses. Customer satisfaction is number one in our business, and we change processes and offers constantly to ensure we maintain our leading position. We have a clear strategy based upon the “product leadership" value discipline, which has enabled the business to clearly focus on its priorities and innovation to strengthen our position. Clear key performance indicator (KPI) targets and performance-based management systems provide clarity and drive the business forward.</p><h4>What trends have you noticed across your dealerships over the past six months?</h4><p>There has been a definite market recovery over the last six months in both our passenger car and commercial vehicle businesses. The country is thriving and we can witness this through our commercial vehicle business, which sells truck and van fleets for construction companies, oil and gas corporations, hotels, and more. When these entities start ordering large fleets of trucks for construction sites, buses for public transportation, or vans for hotel shuttles and limousines, this means there is confidence in the real estate market and preparations for population growth. Within passenger car operations, sales are increasing and bank financing is more available, assisting customers to purchase cars. Our developing after-sales services also highlight our commitment to customer loyalty and satisfaction.</p><h4>How did you adapt your business strategy during the economic downturn?</h4><p>The downturn reminded us to focus on our core strengths and run a tighter business. We maintained our structure and teams as we focus on the longer term and ensure that we deliver customer satisfaction. We have sophisticated inventory management systems and procedures that have allowed us to react quickly to the changes in market demand. These have served us very well during the downturn and recovery period. For example, by studying feedback from our customers we launched solutions to encourage customer retention, such as customized service contracts for Mercedes-Benz commercial vehicles and passenger car owners. Due to this strategy, we maintained high scores in customer satisfaction ratings, reaching over 95% in sales, further emphasizing the vision, mission, and values of the group.</p><div class="quote">“To succeed you have to keep improving, and this continuous ambition is central to our success."</div><h4>What opportunities do you see in the UAE's automotive sector?</h4><p>The sector is vibrant and growing. We will always seek to offer new solutions to meet our customers' needs and new complementary products that fill market demand. We see growth in the premium sector, especially within the small car segment. For instance, when the Fiat 500 by Gucci and Fiat Abarth 695 Tributo Ferrari were launched in the market, we increased year-on-year sales by 50%. Mercedes-Benz has also seen the opportunity for this segment in the UAE, and has recently launched the long-awaited A-Class. Our first consignment virtually sold out within a few days. In 2012, we saw a growing interest in requests for customizations, showing there is a trend in the market for individuality. We now have a “Bespoke" edition of the CLS/ML and GL, offering a much sportier look to the V8 models. We also have a range of super luxury Vito vans available for our customers. In parallel, we also look to grow our share of the super luxury sector further, with the new S-Class Mercedes-Benz, which is among the favorite models of high-income businessmen and VIPs. On a broader level, we are witnessing a more environmentally aware generation emerge, showing hybrid cars will grow in popularity.</p><h4>How are Al Fahim Group's dealerships encouraging Emiratis to enter the workforce?</h4><p>Al Fahim Group has implemented a special employment strategy in line with the initiative of His Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the UAE, including the Absher initiative to enhance the participation of UAE nationals in the labor market. We have established this exclusive recruitment strategy in line with the Absher initiative's four main pillars: the provision of job opportunities in all sectors, rehabilitation and training, guidance and counseling, and encouraging nationals to work in the private sector to support the policies of Emiratization. In April 2013 we held an open day at our premises in Mussafah, where over 30 Emirati men and women attended to learn more about customer service, career development, and share their CVs for potential employment at Al Fahim Group. Al Fahim Group's recruitment plan includes 80 UAE nationals in Al Fahim Group's workforce in the coming five years across our diverse business members. Our efforts to attract Emiratis are driven by our corporate social responsibility as a local company, but also by our deep belief that by raising the participation rate of UAE nationals in any organization structure we will support its competitiveness, sustainability, and stability. It is our duty as a local company to strive toward providing a decent standard of living for UAE nationals and securing stable job opportunities guaranteeing a brighter future for them and increasing the rate of employment of Emiratis across all industries.</p><h4>Which Mercedes models have been historically popular at your flagship dealership Emirates Motors Company?</h4><p>The most popular model at Emirates Motor Company has always been the luxurious Mercedes-Benz E-Class, yet in 2012 the CLS was one of the most admired models, witnessing a 41% increase compared to the same period in the previous year. The SUV range is also a highly regarded segment at Mercedes-Benz with the Mercedes-Benz GL and M-Class. Naturally, we also have a large customer base of sporty car enthusiasts, with which the Mercedes-Benz SLK and SL are popular.</p><h4>The UAE's automotive industry was up 12%-18% in 2012. What were some of your highlights?</h4><p>Within Emirates Motor Company, we witnessed growth in our SUV segment by 53%, sports segment by 32%, and the Mercedes-Benz CLS by 64%, while Jeep Grand Cherokee showed a strong growth of over 44% across all models. Overall, we had our best year ever in sales volumes and seek to grow further in 2013. We owe this accomplishment to many milestones our automotive business members have observed in the last few years, building up to this moment. Besides housing the largest Mercedes-Benz facility in the world right here in Abu Dhabi, our al-Ain automotive operations have also seen a surge in performance in 2012. We announced our partnership with the Department of Transport (DOT) in al-Ain, where a new state-of-the-art bus service and maintenance center operated by our al-Ain branch, Eastern Motors, was inaugurated. The DOT public bus maintenance and service center comes exclusively to service al-Ain's 100 public transport Mercedes-Benz buses. Additionally, due to a rise of over 17% in Michelin tires by Eastern Motors since 2009, reaffirming the increase in demand for professional car servicing to passenger cars, especially SUVs, the dealership launched one of the most professional tire-fitting centers in the city in 2012.</p><h4>Coming off the back of a high-performing year, how do you plan to sustain growth?</h4><p>Our expectations continue to rise and we have a growth strategy for 2013 and beyond. Our management is targeted to deliver to customer expectations and grow market share. We are supported by strong principles and have the best facilities. We are investing in al-Ain this year and look forward to growth and success across all our operations. In the city of Abu Dhabi we will be announcing an expansion of the airport road facility for Emirates Motor Company. As for Central Motors &amp; Equipment, another one of our automotive business units, we are opening TYREPLUS, a new tire center to provide convenient and quality tire services through our sole distributorship of Michelin. We also intend to expand our operations with ADNOC to offer Bosch Car Service to everyone in the community. On a more tactical and customer-focused level, we have corporate affinity programs in place as well as flexible payment solutions for individuals. We are also participating for the second time in the Sheikh Khalifa Excellence Award, using the opportunity to showcase our development since our last involvement in 2007. To succeed you have to keep improving, and this continuous ambition is central to our success.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What steps led to the formation of the Azerbaijan Investment Company (AIC)?<br></h4><p>The rapid growth of the non-oil sector is crucial to reducing Azerbaijan's dependence on hydrocarbons. Monetary reserves expanding on the waves of the recent oil boom ensure new opportunities for diversification, and these funds are being used for the development of the non-oil sector and the attraction of foreign investment. Obviously, integration into the global economy is the driving force behind the policy of diversification. The last eight years have seen a four fold increase in the non-oil sector of Azerbaijan's economy, which currently holds a leading position among CIS countries. To maintain its competitiveness, Azerbaijan has prioritized the facilitation of investments via public-private partnerships (PPP). In this context, the establishment of AIC in 2006 was an obvious step forward in implementing the government's policy of diversification. AIC is a state-owned equity fund pursuing the objective of supporting development in the non-oil sector of the national economy via termed-equity injections in partnership with local and foreign investors. The integration of new technology and know-how and the promotion of modernization, innovation, and competitiveness are among the priority objectives of AIC, as well as contributing to the development of the capital markets.</p><h4>What synergy exists between AIC and the Azerbaijan Export and Investment Promotion Foundation (AZPROMO)?</h4><p>We at AIC are privileged to have a powerful sister company in AZPROMO, working along the same frontiers of promoting Azerbaijan and its natural and intellectual resources. AZPROMO and AIC jointly offer a solid foundation for foreign investments in commercially viable projects in Azerbaijan. Both companies are dedicated to promoting Azerbaijan, with AIC focusing on equity investments in projects aimed at developing the non-oil sector of the national economy.</p><h4>President Aliyev is actively trying to increase the amount of non-oil FDI that comes into the country. What are AIC's specific strategies to realize this?</h4><p>AIC is an effective vehicle designed to implement the President's vision and guidelines for the prosperous future of Azerbaijan. AIC upholds the concept of supporting local and foreign investors interested in commercially feasible projects in the non-oil sector of the national economy, and adheres to principles of strict compliance with international corporate governance standards. As a state-owned investment company, AIC's engagement in projects is always based on minority shareholding, without being a burden on other stakeholders. AIC is limited to representation at the board level only. In addition to equity investment, we are also here to offer our expertise in current market trends in the priority sectors of the national economy, identify investment opportunities for foreign and local investors, and provide technical support in carrying out and preparing market research and surveys, as well as in the development of business plans.</p><div class="quote">“Integration into the global economy is the driving force behind the policy of diversification."</div><h4>Which non-oil sectors are currently seeing the most interest from foreign investors?</h4><p>Logistics is currently seeing a lot of interest from foreign investors. Located at the crossroads between Asia and Europe, Azerbaijan is the most stable country in the region in both economic and political terms. Bridging Europe and Central Asia, as well as connecting Northeastern Europe with the Middle East, Azerbaijan is also a logistics hub for the entire Caspian region. AIC is actively engaged in assessing projects in this sector with potential partners. Industry is also seeing a lot of interest. The country has always been at the forefront of regional industrial development. Along with oil and natural gas extraction and processing, engineering, metallurgy, and electricity generation form the pillars of the manufacturing industry. The government has already prioritized the development of the latter three segments of manufacturing with a particular focus on chemical engineering, which saw the establishment of Sumgait Chemical Industrial Park LLC on December 21, 2011. The initiative will serve the purpose of creating a favorable and simplified business environment to develop a competitive chemical industry via innovative and cutting-edge technology. The alternative and renewable energy sector in Azerbaijan is as attractive to investors as mother nature has prescribed it. Azerbaijan offers the most favorable climatic conditions to foster a renewable energy industry. For solar panels, we have over 280 days of bright sunshine a year, and for wind turbines Azerbaijan offers a guaranteed continuous supply of strong winds throughout the year. The Caspian sees high tidal cycles and an abundance of fast flowing mountain rivers for hydropower plants, and last but not the least, the soil in Azerbaijan is renowned for its arable qualities, and is capable of producing a high yield of biomass. Tourism is also a fast-developing industry in Azerbaijan. The government is investing heavily in infrastructure to facilitate tourism in the country following the “Year of Tourism" in 2011. In 2012, Azerbaijan hosted the Eurovision Song Contest and the FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup. A number of five-star luxury hotels with global brands have also opened their doors in Baku in the recent years. The initial phase of the Shahdag Summer-Winter Tourism Complex is also nearing completion. Recently, Azerbaijan successfully won the bid to host the first European Olympic Games in 2015. Azerbaijan also has ambitious plans to host the Olympics and the UEFA European Football Championship in the near future. ICT is yet another industry in Azerbaijan that attracts remarkably high interest from local and foreign investors alike. For investors in ICT, Azerbaijan offers excellent infrastructure. The country is launching its first satellite into space in 2013, which will offer tremendous opportunities in telecommunications and IT, not only in the country, but also in the region at large. As recently as November 2012, President Aliyev declared the establishment of a high-tech industrial park in the country, which will, yet again, offer investors a favorable business environment. Azerbaijan prides itself on its high literacy levels (99.6%) and excellent IT and foreign language skills. The State Program on Education Abroad has been in operation since 2007, a part of which includes government sponsorship of national students studying abroad. A considerable number of these students are choosing ICT as a university degree. Finally, agriculture is also attracting foreign investor interest. Food security and regional development are among the top priorities for Azerbaijan. The country has the most favorable climatic conditions and affordable tax regime in the region. In partnership with RAO Global Group GmbH, we at AIC have launched the “Aghstafa Agroservice" project to support local farmers to increase productivity and boost the efficient use of topsoil by providing all kinds of agro-technical services. The project has proven to be a great success, and we are already planning to expand the network of service hubs to other regions of the country.</p><h4>Which sectors are currently the priority for AIC to promote and how?</h4><p>Industry is one of the obvious priorities in Azerbaijan. AIC has been actively involved in a number of successful projects targeting industry development in the non-oil sector of the national economy. A new, state-of-the-art cement production facility with dry output of cement and clinker has been launched in partnership with Holcim—one of the world's leading suppliers of cement and aggregates—and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). Holcim-Azerbaijan OJSC is one of the largest cement producers in the region, and it has recently increased its production capacity with less pollution and energy use. Yet another success story for us is the Baku Shipyard Plant project that we are involved in together with the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR) and Keppel Corporation, one of the world's largest offshore and marine groups with a global network of 20 shipyards and offices.</p><p>Agriculture and food processing are vital components of Azerbaijan's non-oil economy, and they have significant potential for boosting the country's export revenues. While agriculture only accounts for 7% of GDP, it is still a key source of jobs and is a priority in the context of food security. In food processing, AIC is engaged in a project in partnership with one of the largest local holding companies. The project saw a new salt production facility constructed just outside of Baku to produce high-quality refined and iodized salt. We are also holding equity in a dairy production project in partnership with the EBRD and a number of local investors. A new milk processing plant has already been launched as an outcome of the project.</p><h4>Looking back at the past 10 years of President Aliyev's administration, how would you say the investment climate has changed?</h4><p>The personal dedication and perseverance committed by Ilham Aliyev, the President of Azerbaijan, over the past 10 years have brought dramatic changes to the country's investment climate. Continuous improvements in Azerbaijan's macroeconomic environment earned the nation 18th place in the relevant pillar of the Basic Requirements Index of the Global Competitiveness Report 2012-2013 by the World Economic Forum, which ranked 144 world economies. The favorable business environment sustained in Azerbaijan has attracted investments in excess of $136 billion, about $70 billion of which is attributed to FDI.</p><p>The high impact changes introduced in the macroeconomic environment of the country have resulted in a substantial increase of the private sector's share in national GDP, which stands at 83% at present. Notably, the 2009 Doing Business report published by the World Bank and IFC puts Azerbaijan in the leading position in terms of the quality of reforms carried out to improve the business environment in the country. The improved business environment along with rises in public expenditure, according to the Transition Report 2012 published by the EBRD in December 2012, was a stimulus for the accelerated expansion of the non-oil sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[The New Asset Mix]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[the-new-asset-mix]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you describe the scope of the activities that the State Oil Fund of the Republic of Azerbaijan (SOFAZ) is active in?</h4><p>President Heydar Aliyev established SOFAZ back in 1999 as an integral part of the government's oil strategy. The first stage of this strategy involved the development of oil and gas fields in cooperation with major foreign oil and gas corporations. The second stage was focused on establishing multiple oil and gas transportation routes connecting Azerbaijan with major international markets. The third stage of the strategy involved the establishment of SOFAZ, with the main purpose to maintain transparent and prudent management of the country's oil and gas revenues. One of SOFAZ's main objectives is the preservation of macroeconomic stability by insulating the economy from oil revenue volatility, decreasing dependence on hydrocarbons, and stimulating the development of the non-oil sector. The second objective is to ensure intergenerational equality with regard to the country's oil wealth. Non-renewable natural resources are converted into a diversified portfolio of international financial assets, which generates perpetual income for current and future generations. The investment portfolio is only invested in assets outside of Azerbaijan, and until 2012 it was mostly allocated to fixed-income securities denominated in three major international currencies. In 2012, we diversified into new markets by adding exposure to new asset classes, namely gold, real estate and equities, and different currencies. The third objective is allocating resources for funding major socioeconomic projects. For instance, we have completed financing the state's share in the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline construction project. Currently, we are financing the construction of the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars (BTK) railroad and the construction of the settlement for refugees and internally displaced persons who were forced to flee their native lands as a result of Armenia-Azerbaijan, Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Furthermore, we are funding the “State Program on the Education of Azerbaijani Youth Abroad from 2007-2015," which provides full scholarships to Azerbaijani students studying in leading international universities. In 2013, we are starting a number of new projects in cooperation with the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR)—we will begin funding the Trans-Anatolian Pipeline (TANAP) project, which is an integral part of the Southern Gas Corridor and will allow the transit of gas to Europe.</p><h4>What would you say were some of your major achievements in 2012?</h4><p>I would say that 2012 was a milestone year for SOFAZ. We modified our investment strategy to include several new asset classes and started building a diversified, multi-asset class portfolio, thus enhancing the expected return of our investments. Our conservative, risk-cautious investment strategy served us well in the past, enabling the fund to avoid incurring losses during the turbulent years of the global financial crisis or a low-yield environment, and prevailing in the financial markets in the post-crisis period, which substantially limited its performance. As in every new beginning, each one of these new instruments has brought its challenges. However, the capacity we have built over the years, from both a human resources and infrastructure point of view, has enabled us to successfully overcome those obstacles.</p><h4>SOFAZ has recently made some high-profile real estate acquisitions in Paris and London. What led you to make these decisions regarding the purchase of real estate?</h4><p>According to SOFAZ's current investment guidelines, up to 5% of its investment portfolio may be allocated to real estate. Our current investment strategy with regard to this asset class is aimed at building a globally diversified portfolio comprised of core assets in key cities around the globe. All of  the potential investments are thoroughly analyzed along several parameters, such as price, location, quality, current tenants, and development potential. The highest-scoring properties are acquired.</p><h4>Are you involved in any projects in Azerbaijan to improve state infrastructure?</h4><p>Only large-scale projects of national significance are financed by SOFAZ. Over 2013, in addition to the projects I mentioned earlier, we will start funding a fiber-to-the-home project aimed at providing broadband internet access to every house in the country. This project has significant potential for moving forward the telecommunications sector in Azerbaijan.</p><h4>How much of SOFAZ's portfolio is in gold, and what made you decide to acquire that asset?</h4><p>In accordance with our current investment policy, up to 5% of our investment portfolio may be allocated to gold. We started our investments in this asset class in February 2012 and acquired around 15 tons of gold by the end of the year. In 2013, we are planning to increase our gold holdings to 30 tons, and we have already started transporting it to Azerbaijan. As an asset class, gold has several unique characteristics that makes it attractive for investors. In the long run, gold is considered to act as an effective instrument for hedging inflation and currency risks. Moreover, gold offers protection from heightened volatility in financial markets during economic downturns as it is negatively correlated to both equity and fixed income.</p><h4>How would you characterize the evolution of Azerbaijan's investment climate over the last decade?</h4><p>I recently attended a farewell dinner for one of the ambassadors who spent roughly 10 years here. In his words he said, “I came to one country and I am leaving a totally different country." During his 10 years here, Azerbaijan has absolutely transformed itself into a new country. Wide-ranging economic reforms implemented by the government have resulted in notable progress to improve regulatory efficiency and encourage domestic economic diversification, especially in the areas of agriculture, tourism, and ICT. The government invested in the development and modernization of the country's infrastructure, laying the foundation for private sector investments in the country. Azerbaijan has enjoyed measurable success in diversifying its economy outside of the energy sector, with the non-oil portion of the economy growing significantly.</p><h4>What further strategies do you have for 2013?</h4><p>Overall, 2012 was marked by the fund entering public equities, real estate, and gold markets. At the same time, we have added new currencies to our investment portfolio—the Australian dollar, the Russian ruble, and the Turkish lira. In 2013, we will continue building up our exposure to these asset classes and further diversify our investment portfolio. We are planning to increase our exposure to equities, both public and private. We will also strengthen our position in real estate. At the moment, we are exploring new regions for attractive investment opportunities in real estate.</p><h4>What are your medium-term plans for SOFAZ?</h4><p>Over the next few years, we plan to expand institutionally and professionally. We are looking forward to further increasing our allocation to equities and alternative assets. These financial instruments are expected to perform better than fixed income in the long-term perspective. This is in line with the long-term investor nature of the fund. On a separate note, we have always managed the majority of our assets in-house. That way, we are able to gain valuable experience and a deeper understanding of those markets. During the initial stages of our investments in the new asset classes, we decided to employ the know-how and expertise of the largest players in those markets. For instance, our public equity portfolios are currently being managed externally. However, we are planning on gradually increasing the fund's involvement in the management of those assets, while keeping an eye on cost efficiency. In the meantime, we will be building the internal capacity necessary for efficient in-house management by investing heavily in staff training and developing necessary systems and practices.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What market factors led to the establishment of Yobel in the Dominican Republic?<br></h4><p>Yobel Logistics has over 40 years of experience and professional service dedicated to optimizing processes in supply chains through its specialized business units. In addition, we are the first company in the Latin American region to offer outsourced service in supply chain management in 13 countries: Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and the US. Yobel was established in the country 10 years ago, offering something unique in the sector—supply chain management focused on logistics services. Our activity in the country has become a key business branch for the company, because we have experienced an average annual growth of 25% thanks to our unique offering. We provide physical infrastructure, technology, and qualified and skilled labor. I believe that such an offering is one of our main competitive advantages, and at the same time, the company has benefited significantly from the economic development of the Dominican Republic in the last few years. Today, both local companies and international enterprises form our client portfolio, which currently consists of 10 companies.</p><h4>How would you rate the workforce in the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>There are many different groups in the country's workforce; those within the minimum wage group can be described as extremely hard working and very flexible, whereas administrative and management employees are highly qualified at a national level. In the past few years, there has been an important increase in the number of locals pursuing higher education studies in the US and other countries. We have experience in working with all three groups of people, and I can say that such experiences have been very fruitful and successful.</p><h4>What is Yobel's potential for developing manufacturing services in the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>Although Yobel offers manufacturing services elsewhere, we have yet to develop these activities in the Dominican Republic. It is a matter of the size of the market; we have manufacturing, including customization and production services in Mexico, Guatemala, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Colombia, and Peru, which are large markets and offer good infrastructure services to export to other countries. If a business opportunity to develop such activities in the country arises, we would analyze its feasibility and future potential. Now, we can see that the national economy tends to focus on the service sector, and we understand that both the authorities and the private sector are aiming to develop production and manufacturing industries with value-added. Yobel can expect to play a key role in developing this industry in the Dominican Republic. We believe that the externalization of manufacturing and production activities is the best option in terms of profitability and economic viability, with the option to share the manufacturing costs with other companies.</p><h4>What are Yobel's main investment lines in the country?</h4><p>Our investment policy is based on reinvesting our profits, and this aggressive approach is due to the growth of the country. In terms of areas of investment, we mostly focus on developing know-how, innovation, and technology, as well as building strong teams of professionals through training courses. One of our main aims is to implement new services for our clients and widen our service portfolio. For example, over the last few years we started offering agency  services to improve efficiency. Since we are an international company, we also take advantage of our unique features to offer specialized advice and services based on our experience.</p><h4>What are the growth prospects for Yobel in the short term?</h4><p>We expect to close 2013 with a growth rate of around 15% to 17%, and our strategic development plan for the company for the next 10 years foresees Yobel growing at a higher pace than national GDP. We believe there is still a long road ahead of us, with very good growth potential for the company thanks to the economic and political stability the region has achieved. In addition, we are planning to expand our area of operations from 15,000 sqm to 20,000 sqm, as well as increase the number of employees in the country by 20%.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the Dominican Republic placed within the region in terms of the competitiveness and maturity of the technological field?<br></h4><p>I believe there is a lot of potential in the Dominican Republic in terms of the evolution of ICT. One way to develop it is with enterprise companies. These companies evolved in 2011 in terms of usage of ICT as a mechanism for business development. These companies are using ICT to provide more services to their customers. Take the banking, insurance, and mining sectors, for example; they have many uses for ICT and are pushing hard to provide more services. This type of usage would be the average across the region; however, there are still many opportunities for ICT to develop across SMEs that could be used to increase services and make them more agile.</p><h4>How big an influence has piracy had on the take up of the Windows operating system in the Dominican Republic when compared to the other countries in the Caribbean and Latin America?</h4><p>The usage of Microsoft Plus! is one of the highest in the region. Although Microsoft products have a high penetration rate, piracy remains a problem. This country has one of the highest rates of pirated software use in the region, close to 74%. The problem is SMEs, because these types of companies make up the majority. We need to educate SME owners that ICT is an investment that will make their businesses more agile and prosperous. However, the government is willing to work with us and we are making progress. It is important to understand that piracy affects everyone, not only Microsoft. Piracy affects the technology industry as well as the music and film and arts industry. In the end, piracy has a negative effect on the economy as well as the knowledge economy of a country, thus hindering innovation.</p><h4>How are you educating small- and medium-sized organizations, and what has been the response?</h4><p>We are working with many organizations in the country to show SME organizations that ICT is an investment and not an expense. The response has been modest so far; however, I think this government is looking to focus on formalizing these organizations. I believe this kind of movement in conjunction with the industry will support development. The best way to create prosperity is to improve business for SMEs, and this is a goal that we share with the government. A huge focus we have as a company now is the cloud and how it can specifically help SMEs prosper. We have the most complete cloud solutions for SMEs to “feel and act big," while enjoying the same benefits and flexibility with ICT as the larger companies.</p><h4>The products of the year are Microsoft Office 365 and Cloud Services. What are the expectations in the Dominican Republic for these new applications?</h4><p>This is one of the most intense years for Microsoft that I have seen. I have been in this industry for more than 19 years, 15 of them with Microsoft. I have never seen such intensity in product development. The number of new products we are delivering to the market is amazing. We have already launched Office 365, and Windows 8 was launched globally on October 26, 2012. Recently, we launched the new Windows Phone through the largest operator. We will also launch additional cloud services soon. A huge amount of innovation is happening in the Dominican Republic. If you think of the savings in terms of energy and availability that cloud solutions bring, it is just amazing for this country. The government is even running its infrastructure using our Cloud services. In 2011, Microsoft grew by 24% in the Dominican Republic and the country's economy grew 4%. That Microsoft is growing by 24% shows the acceleration the country is experiencing in ICT. We are one of the fastest-growing companies in the Caribbean.<span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Shipping companies have recently expressed concerns regarding the trade deficit that the Dominican Republic suffers. What is your view of the current situation?<br></h4><p>Any economy that is facing such a thing is probably experiencing inflation. This could benefit exports, but on the other hand, negatively affect the volume of imports. Obviously, in the shipping business and the airfreight business, volume is always an important factor for the success of our services and the infrastructure that has been created in the port and airport terminals.</p><h4>How was Maritima Dominicana's performance in 2011?</h4><p>In our specific case, we celebrated our 40th anniversary in 2011, and for the first time in the history of the company we were able to attend to more than 2,000 ship calls at Dominican ports. We were the first shipping company in the Dominican Republic that was ISO 9001 certified. Over the last few years, Maritima Dominicana was also awarded the ISO 14001 certificate for the protection of the environment and gained OHSAS 18001 certification for the protection and security of all employees. This is one of the requirements of global companies.</p><h4>How has the country evolved to face challenges and improve its competitiveness over recent years?</h4><p>The private sector shipping business has made some very important investments over the last 10 years, including Haina International Terminals and the terminal at Caucedo, which is being managed by DP World, but is 50% owned by local investors, including Maritima Dominicana. One of the worries that the sector has had over the years is bureaucracy, especially in the areas of customs and security services. In the case of customs, fortunately, the Dominican Republic has initiated an entirely different system to perform customs clearance electronically.</p><h4>Has your investment in expansion at Haina increased your business in the country?</h4><p>We have invested in both terminals since the beginning as the private sector obtained the license to operate the port of Haina, which is still owned by the state but is operated by a private entity. Maritima Dominicana invested both in Haina and Caucedo. The reason why we felt this was extremely important was that when the International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) requirements structure was produced, a state-owned port terminal could not have reached the compliance level of these requirements without the help of the private sector. This was particularly important in the case of Haina, whereas Caucedo was always a private terminal. In terms of getting ISPS certification at Haina, the government realized (12 years ago) that this would not be reached and Haina would go out of business. Obviously, this has contributed to stabilizing the maritime industry in the Dominican Republic to remain competitive and position itself be able to offer adequate services to the shipping community around the world. This has resulted in Haina increasing its volume dramatically over the last 10 years, while Caucedo has attracted entirely new business. Around 60%-70% of Caucedo's business is transshipment today, rather than local cargo. This has also given us opportunities to attract services, and therefore made us capable of attending more ships.</p><div class="quote">“The private sector shipping business has made some very important investments over the last 10 years."</div><h4>How has Maritima Dominicana's model changed as a service company over the last 20 years?</h4><p>We started as a shipping agent and stevedore, and now we are also a warehouse operator, reefer warehouse operator, and equipment operator; we have a fleet of over 1,200 chassis to provide inland transportation services. We have off-dock terminals here where our office is and in Caucedo and Puerto Plata. We have a company called Reefer Services, which provides reefer container repair and maintenance to all shipping companies that operate in the Dominican Republic. We have a company called Equipos y Transportes (ET), which provides equipment at the port terminals and for local inland transportation. Therefore, the model of the service range we provide has changed to supply chain management.</p><h4>Maritima Dominicana is a member of the Baltic &amp; International Maritime Council (BIMCO). What does this mean for a shipping company in the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>We are a member of BIMCO, which is based in Copenhagen, Denmark. This is an organization that was created 100 years ago in the steam ship era and provides norms of conduct within the industry. For example, it develops examples for shipping contracts and insurance conditions. Because BIMCO tries to help the idea of globalization, a certain standard of services are provided; whether it is here in the Dominican Republic or in Timbuktu. That is the idea of BIMCO.</p><h4>How do you think the country fared economically in 2012?</h4><p>I believe that 2012 was a very stable year. We are facing financial challenges of which we are all aware. Inflation could be a factor that will affect international commerce. However in a globalized world, we are also impacted by influences from all around us. If the US and the EU do well, we do well. If they suffer, we suffer too. It is the same in South America because those countries are our most important trading partners today after the US. The economies in South America and the Caribbean are fairly stable at the moment, and our economy will also benefit from that factor.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will the austerity plans announced by the Dominican government impact your Ministry's plans?<br></h4><p>Many of the key people within this Ministry come from the private sector, and therefore we are used to living under austerity plans. For that reason, when I recently took over the position as Minister, my team and I assumed the responsibilities handed over by President Danilo Medina. Sometimes, a team can do better than its predecessors with half of the economic resources the others had, and therefore our vision is to tend to the needs of small projects rather than look at the big picture. The country currently has very important road infrastructure that over the years has been forgotten. For that reason, we aim to boost road maintenance investment rather than develop new projects. Our main target is to implement road infrastructure policies and works that will last—those that the Ministry will not need to re-invest in every time there is a change of government. In addition to that, we are currently revising all of the existing project contracts as part of what we call “value engineering." We will revise the terms, work done, and budgets of these projects to see if they conform to today's realities.</p><h4>What plans does the Ministry have to contribute to the government's target to reach 10 million tourists per year?</h4><p>Our Ministry's working agenda is tightly linked to the government's national plans, and through our strategies and work we aim to reinforce them. President Medina established tourism as a strategic sector for the country's economy, and the first thing we did here was to revise all of the road infrastructure projects in the eastern part of the country, the main tourism destination of the Dominican Republic. For example, the tourism boulevard project was initiated eight years ago and has yet to be completed. At the moment, we have reached an agreement with contractors to boost the project and accelerate its construction by signing a new contract. We have also re-established some of our Ministry's priorities after a long and fruitful meeting with the tourism authorities in Puerto Plata, another very important tourism center for the country. We agreed upon a working agenda for the next four to five years. We share the President's vision of establishing the tourism sector as the strategic engine driving the national economy.</p><h4>Since foreign investment has played a key role in developing infrastructure projects in the country, how would you assess the importance of FDI in the Ministry's future plans?</h4><p>In terms of the Ministry's work, we have not developed projects through foreign investors, because it has been an investment carried out by the country. The Ministry, either on its own or through local or foreign contractors, directly develops road projects. The latter option is prioritized when beneficial payment agreements are reached. However, at the hospitality level, the great majority of projects developed over the last few years have been done through FDI, because they are private initiatives. Having said that, any foreign investor interested in developing projects in the Dominican Republic will always be more than welcome, and from the Ministry, we will make sure that they will compete at the same level as any local company.</p><h4>What role can private investment play in the implementation of national infrastructure plans in a time of budget cuts?</h4><p>We are currently working on several areas. For example, we have set up a working group to determine the best utility for the taxes collected from road tolls, and at the same time, we are working on raising awareness among Dominicans of the importance of paying these fees if they want to enjoy a high standard of roads. The Dominican Republic is home to the most important city with colonial heritage, Santo Domingo. However, current tourism trends are not linked with these cultural aspects because of the lack of good road infrastructure linking the main cities of our country. The Coral Highway and some other complementary projects along this road will make the eastern part of the country a well-connected tourism destination that should boost the overall number of visitors and investment figures.</p><div class="quote">“We have a plan to strengthen the monitoring of construction work in the country."</div><h4>What is the Ministry doing to improve transport infrastructure with Haiti?</h4><p>There are two main roads that currently connect the Dominican Republic and Haiti: through Dajabón province in the north, and through Independencia province in the south. We have already started the whole southern road circuit, and we are working toward recovering the road across Enriquillo Lake in Independencia province. In addition, we are finishing repaving work around the border connection in Jimaní­, which is the border point with the highest traffic density between both countries. We believe that, for our part, the southern connection points will be fully completed by early 2013. We are also in the process of establishing the infrastructure needs of Dajabón, and that will be one of our main focuses of 2013, because Haiti is where we export the most.</p><h4>How is the Ministry working to strengthen the country's response work for natural disasters?</h4><p>We currently have the highest and latest international regulations related to earthquakes when developing construction projects. The Dominican Republic has always been at the international forefront in this field, and we have learned a lot from catastrophes in other countries in the last 20 to 30 years. Also, we belong to leading international bodies and institutions, and that enables us to always be on top in terms of regulations and procedures. At the same time, we have a plan to strengthen the monitoring of construction work in the country, as well as to start a process to monitor the quality of older buildings in the country.</p><h4>What are the main projects that will be inaugurated in the near future?</h4><p>We will be launching a new Caimán Bridge between Enriquillo and Pedernales in December 2012 to replace the one that collapsed 14 years ago when Hurricane Georges hit the country. At the same time, we just finished the Jatubey Bridge in Bonao, and we will inaugurate several new roads such as the Guaco and Salcedo roads. We will boost the Eastern Road Circuit—which is formed of about eight roads—and we expect that it will be finished in 18 months. From December 2012, we will inaugurate the toll points on the Coral Highway, and that will help us to collect funds that will be allocated to the maintenance of the highway. Finally, we will open the first part of the seafront promenade in El Malecón, Santo Domingo. These are only some of the many infrastructure projects we are currently handling and that we will be completing in the next four years, with an average investment budget of Ps50 billion per year.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>TBY talks to Jorge Cabeza, General Manager, Dominican Republic, at Microsoft, on the IT infrastructure in the country, the launch of new products, and solutions to combat piracy.</h4>
<h4></h4>
<h4>TBY How is the Dominican Republic placed within the region in terms of the competitiveness and maturity of the technological field?</h4>
<h4>JORGE CABEZA I believe there is a lot of potential in the Dominican Republic in terms of the evolution of ICT. One way to develop it is with enterprise companies. These companies evolved in 2011 in terms of usage of ICT as a mechanism for business development. These companies are using ICT to provide more services to their customers. Take the banking, insurance, and mining sectors, for example; they have many uses for ICT and are pushing hard to provide more services. This type of usage would be the average across the region; however, there are still many opportunities for ICT to develop across SMEs that could be used to increase services and make them more agile.</h4>
<h4>How big an influence has piracy had on the take up of the Windows operating system in the Dominican Republic when compared to the other countries in the Caribbean and Latin America?</h4>
<p>The usage of Microsoft Plus! is one of the highest in the region. Although Microsoft products have a high penetration rate, piracy remains a problem. This country has one of the highest rates of pirated software use in the region, close to 74%. The problem is SMEs, because these types of companies make up the majority. We need to educate SME owners that ICT is an investment that will make their businesses more agile and prosperous. However, the government is willing to work with us and we are making progress. It is important to understand that piracy affects everyone, not only Microsoft. Piracy affects the technology industry as well as the music and film and arts industry. In the end, piracy has a negative effect on the economy as well as the knowledge economy of a country, thus hindering innovation.</p>
<h4>How are you educating small- and medium-sized organizations, and what has been the response?</h4>
<p>We are working with many organizations in the country to show SME organizations that ICT is an investment and not an expense. The response has been modest so far; however, I think this government is looking to focus on formalizing these organizations. I believe this kind of movement in conjunction with the industry will support development. The best way to create prosperity is to improve business for SMEs, and this is a goal that we share with the government. A huge focus we have as a company now is the cloud and how it can specifically help SMEs prosper. We have the most complete cloud solutions for SMEs to “feel and act big,“ while enjoying the same benefits and flexibility with ICT as the larger companies.</p>
<h4>The products of the year are Microsoft Office 365 and Cloud Services. What are the expectations in the Dominican Republic for these new applications?</h4>
<p>This is one of the most intense years for Microsoft that I have seen. I have been in this industry for more than 19 years, 15 of them with Microsoft. I have never seen such intensity in product development. The number of new products we are delivering to the market is amazing. We have already launched Office 365, and Windows 8 was launched globally on October 26, 2012. Recently, we launched the new Windows Phone through the largest operator. We will also launch additional cloud services soon. A huge amount of innovation is happening in the Dominican Republic. If you think of the savings in terms of energy and availability that cloud solutions bring, it is just amazing for this country. The government is even running its infrastructure using our Cloud services. In 2011, Microsoft grew by 24% in the Dominican Republic and the country’s economy grew 4%. That Microsoft is growing by 24% shows the acceleration the country is experiencing in ICT. We are one of the fastest-growing companies in the Caribbean.</p>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance of Tijuana to Mexico?</h4><p>Tijuana is now considered either the third or fourth largest city in Mexico, and has over 2 million people. Our border with California gives us the largest crossing between two nations, with over 16 million people crossing per year. Our economy is more or less a revolving door with Southern California. We have a city that has over 30 public and private universities. We are one of the largest industrial cities in Mexico, and along the border with the US we are the most important city. We have an inspirational concept that we call “San Diego, Tijuana: two cities, one region." We share the same air and water and there are at least 80,000 US citizens that live in Tijuana. The only problem that Tijuana has right now is the delay crossing the border because the US is investing $600 million in revamping the border crossings. There have been delays on the US side; however, the Mexican side was finished in November 2012. The delays can take three or four hours, which is unacceptable to both sides and it hurts. San Diego County receives about $6 billion in business from Tijuana residents every year. It is a little uneven because we are getting $1.5 billion from San Diego. A few years ago, we had the perception of violence, but I can name you several US cities of a comparable size that are a lot more violent. We have reduced crime by around 60%-70% over the past two years, and now if you go to Tijuana you see the nightlife is back. The only problem we have with tourism is the border crossing. You don't want to go for dinner and lunch and wait two hours to cross the border. We have formed a bi-national association across the border cities because our capitals have difficulties—Washington, DC and Mexico City—understanding border economies. It is a different economy because our commercial areas compete with the more sophisticated places in the US. A lot of people don't realize that the economic activities between all the border cities from the east coast to the west coast form the sixth largest economy in the world, and Tijuana is the leader of that. The association that we built with US border cities started two years ago. I was chairman on the Mexican side and the Mayor from El Paso was the chairman of the US side. That helped us lobby to get more things done and get a better understanding in our capitals. It helps to have not just one mayor going, but all the mayors from both sides. It is kind of working. I think the change in our federal government has done great things for Tijuana. One of the things you are going to see is a new transit system here. Thanks to President Peña's understanding that this city needed a makeover in its transportation, we have the biggest growth in all the country because many people come here with the intention of crossing the border, which is much more difficult now, and they end up staying in Tijuana. They say that Tijuana grows three hectares a day. We are really having difficulties in catching up with utilities and infrastructure. With President Peña giving us federal funds for the new infrastructure, you are going to see a different Tijuana in two or three years.</p><h4>What plans do you have in terms of infrastructure investment?</h4><p>The first investment is for Ps1.5 billion, and there is going to be much more. There is a lot of private investment right now in the commercial areas. I think Tijuana will be the second largest city in Mexico very soon. We have an excellent airport connection to the entire country and our road network  is very good. We are rebuilding the inner city system, which the city is going to invest about Ps800 million in 2013 to fix the roads and infrastructure to better receive foreign and local investment. I think that we have an excellent relationship between our labor and business communities, and one of the things we promote in Asia and Europe is the education system that we have here. For example, one of the universities that we built about 15 years ago is Instituto Tecnológico de Tijuana (ITT), which has over 2,000 students. The curriculum can be adjusted to what investors need. For example, Toyota has been here for several years and we did the training for all of its employees at the university. One thing that stands out is that about 80% of the students have a job when they finish. The flexibility of being able to ensure the companies that they will have a workforce is extremely important. There are over 4,000 trucks that cross every day from Tijuana through the commercial area, and this number is growing. We are trying to, with the federal government, repair the old rail system that is not in service right now. That is another thing that we are trying to obtain from President Peña, which we are sure we will get. There are many things that we are doing right now to receive more investment because we have so many people. A problem is that California is deporting around 300-400 people a day. We don't have the infrastructure or the money as a city to help them out. We have been talking to the US authorities because they deport them by air out of Phoenix and El Paso to the country that they came from. We are about to get authorization to fly them out of the US side. That is a joint program with the US government because that is really a human problem. You pick up these people and they have families, but they are called “illegal," but “undocumented" is a better word. At night, they open the gate and push them back to Tijuana with only the clothes on their back—no identification or anything. We really have that problem. Now, what we are doing is helping them take a bus back home, but we cannot force them. California is emptying its prisons of not just Mexicans, but Central Americans as well.</p><div class="quote">“I think Tijuana will be the second largest city in Mexico very soon."</div><h4>Why is it so important for Tijuana to diversify trade relations?</h4><p>I am actually a businessperson. This is the first time I have been a politician. I am very optimistic about Asia because when Samsung came to Tijuana it was because I brought it to our industrial park, and it grew so much that it built its own Samsung City. We also have Kyosera from Japan and Hyundai from Korea. We were just there in November 2012, and it is starting another investment to build parts for motors in the Alabama plant. Instead of bringing its suppliers from South Korea or China, it is building them in Tijuana. Right now, if you check the cost of labor in China and add the high cost of transport and shipping and oil, the Chinese have really given more benefits. It is not as cheap as it used to be. A decade ago some US firms that were in Tijuana went to China, and now they are coming back to Tijuana.</p><h4>How do you foresee the new administration creating changes in Tijuana?</h4><p>President Peña, during and after his campaign, was the first elected president to receive the mayors from all over the country. He understands that everything starts at the local level. We call him the “Municipality President." He visits the different cities, and he came to Tijuana 15 days after he took office to see what we were doing. For all the cities, he is very interested in what we are going to do to prevent crime. The government is giving us Ps58 million for crime prevention. The President is very interested in pacifying the cities and I think it is going to be great for all the cities, not just Tijuana.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of ABB in Qatar?</h4><p>Global demand for ABB solutions has meant it has been a very international company since its early days in 1883. ABB today is a leader in power and automation technologies that enable utility and industry customers to improve performance while lowering their environmental impact. The ABB Group of companies operates in around 100 countries and employs about 145,000 people. ABB was one of the first European power and automation companies to go to Asia and the Middle East. ABB has been involved in Qatar since the 1960s and has had a representative office since 1995. ABB in Qatar was formed locally in 2005 in partnership with the Hawar Group. Since then, local staff numbers have multiplied by more than 40 times and continue to grow with 260 ABB employees today. ABB has a long-term commitment to Qatar and is proud to contribute to the country's present and future development. With our technology leadership, global presence, and local expertise, we offer products, systems, solutions, and services that meet customer needs related to energy consumption for cooling, desalinization, and sustainability.</p><h4>What are the most important projects that ABB is active in?</h4><p>At the moment, there are two major players in this market: Qatar Petroleum (QP) and Kahramaa. Both are focused on the energy sector and both are ongoing customers of ABB. Where we are really growing is in infrastructure and transport; the Doha Metro and the light-rail projects are of keen interest to ABB. Another growth area we are targeting is the water segment, because Qatar is building a lot to guarantee its water security, through both desalinization and sewage systems. We are also active in “smart buildings," where we are increasing the sustainability of hospitals and hotels, for example. We have also opened a state-of-the-art motor and generator repair workshop, where we can make a factory-like repair as if it were done in Europe. This is extremely practical to our customers, not only in Qatar, but also in Oman, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Kuwait.</p><div class="quote">“Global demand for ABB solutions has meant it has been a very international company since its early days in 1883."</div><h4>How are you leveraging your capabilities to develop Qatar's knowledge-based economy?</h4><p>At ABB, we have 8,000 scientists and engineers working closely in R&amp;D. We work very closely with 70 of the top universities in the world, such as MIT in the US. We are starting on that to make it permanent here in Qatar, and whenever we have an opportunity we are very open minded if someone here in Qatar wants ABB to be a part of a project. The challenge here is that so many things are happening at the same time.</p><h4>How do you deal with issues related to human capital?</h4><p>Our relationship with local universities is receiving greater focus and we are currently supporting schools like Texas A&amp;M University, College of the North Atlantic, and Qatar University, and we have started yearly internship programs so students are able to experience life in ABB. Increasing Qatarization is a difficult issue for companies like ours. One reason is because the workforce in Qatar is limited, and many students want to either work in the government or for one of the Qatari companies. We have started a dialog with the universities to start internship programs. That has raised certain interest in young Qataris who see international companies as an opportunity.</p><h4>How would you characterize the current investment climate in Qatar?</h4><p>The major challenge is really the lack of human capital in Qatar. It is not very easy because you have restrictions with the national quotas and you have a restriction in that before people can get family sponsor status, they have to have been paid six months' salary here. However, many people don't want to compromise by being separated from their family for half a year. Many of our innovations that require prior approval also tend to take a lot of time. A positive thing here is that Qatar targets high-quality products. This is a good fit for ABB. There is a lot of investment in several projects here, which also means that everyone is interested in this market, so the competition is fierce. It is a very interesting market, and it is a pleasure to be here because of the pace of development.</p><h4>What are some of your medium-term strategies and targets for ABB in Qatar?</h4><p>ABB always tries to be a local company. Our target is to grow together with the market, and also look at projects and investments that make sense where we can really support Qatar's national vision of 2030. We really want to be the company that is giving the best customer support in Qatar, and our business and people programs in place today will ensure we deliver on those promises.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Danilo Medina, President of the Dominican Republic, on the need to reform the economy and the key targets his administration is setting over the long term for education.</p><p>The Dominican Republic is in the midst of an ambitious plan of reform and development. In the first six months of this government, we have accomplished many goals, and we have even more before us. But our course remains clear—the Dominican people are the center of all policies. Based on this clear direction, the first priority of our work is to combat poverty and inequality. That is our most important goal and the condition without which all other policies and projects will be meaningless.</p><p>With this in mind our first focus area has been resources allocation. We have designed an annual plan that will result in better services and care for our citizens. We are investing in our people as never before.</p><p>In this budget we have fulfilled the commitment to allocate at least 4% of GDP for pre-university education and have raised the allocation for higher education. We are now concentrating our efforts on ensuring that these resources are used more to have a tangible impact on the quality, equity, and coverage of our educational system and prevent them from being absorbed by inefficiency or malpractice. This is an opportunity rarely seen in our history to drive a real transformation of the education system.</p><p>Part of this transformation has been the launch of the most ambitious national literacy plan in our history, “Quisqueya Learn Contigo." This is a nationwide effort that will enable more than 850,000 young people and adults to have the opportunity, in the next two years, to join the education system and to realize their right to education.</p><p>As of March 2013, 40 days after its initial implementation, there are 100,000 people attending these learning centers throughout the country and around 7,000 literacy volunteers. Seldom have we seen an initiative as plural and united as this one.</p><p>We are now embarking on another major National Plan, this time aimed at protecting our most precious asset: our children. We will greatly expand the coverage and protection of children from zero to five years, to accompany and support families in their children's development during this crucial stage of life. We want to assure comprehensive care, including protection, nutrition, health, education, affection, and psychomotor stimulation, enabling them to develop their capabilities.</p><p>They are now the happiness of our homes, and tomorrow the new Dominican Republic will be on their shoulders. In 2013, we will build 100 new kindergartens and 100 community centers. We will simultaneously extend the availability of pre-primary education to more than 90% of children under five years of age, which means adding nearly 200,000 children to the education system.</p><p>In parallel, we have launched the construction of 10,000 classrooms and their kitchens and dining rooms. This initiative of school buildings is ambitious not only in its size but also in its process. For the first time, the allocation was by public lotteries, open, and transparent. It resulted in 919 contracts throughout the country.</p><p>While our first commitment is to the less fortunate, strengthening the middle class is key to improving the quality of life, expanding the domestic market, and ensuring political and social stability.</p><p>We know that many middle class families maintain a precarious balance between income and expenses. They contribute significantly to the payment of taxes, and yet traditionally have not had access to quality public services, leaving them burdened to fill the gap individually. To address this, we have begun to raise the efficiency of public spending to ensure that every penny of public money will be used to meet the needs of the people.</p><p>Public health is another good example of the improvement in the services we have started, and will continue to deepen. I will share a single statistic summarizing the results of the complex task of restructuring the primary and specialty care being done by the Ministry of Public Health and Social Assistance; in the past six months we have doubled total services to the population through the public health network.</p><p>Another strategic area of focus has been the improvement and repair of roads. The Ministry of Public Works has already rehabilitated 230 kilometers of roads. In addition, the Ministry is engaged in constructing nearly 1,500 kilometers of highways and roads throughout the country.</p><p>The construction of housing is another initiative taken since the first day of the current administration. In this sector, our work is headed in two directions. First, we are addressing the needs of communities living in high-risk areas. Second, we are working closely with the private sector to enable access to credit for the massive construction of housing for the middle and lower classes.</p><p>The National Housing Institute maintains the process of building comprehensive projects and social housing. Since August 2012, over 8,000 housing units in 12 municipalities and 10 provinces have been completed. The institute is currently in the process of international competitive bidding to build another 800 additional homes, with funding from the Andean Development Corporation and the Dominican State.</p><p>In regards to encouraging public-private projects, the Presidential Commission for the Development Trust Mortgage Market will soon be ready to call for bids and contract project design City Juan Bosch, which includes the construction of 35,000 homes over the next seven years.</p><p>To implement the project, the state will contribute to a trust about 3 million sqm of land. The private sector, contributing its own resources and financing, will handle construction.</p><p>Public safety is another top priority. We have appointed a committee composed of the Ministers of Interior and Police, the Office of the President, the Attorney General's Office, and the Chief of Police in order to work on the presentation of a public safety plan. In March 2013, we announced the National Citizen Security Plan, which is designed to simultaneously attack crime and its root causes.</p><p>We realize that financing the agricultural sector is key to development, so it is and will always be one of our highest priorities. Between August 2012 and mid-February 2013, the Agricultural Bank granted loans worth Ps12 million for a total of more than Ps300 million to 16,000 producers. The ultimate goal for 2013 is to increase credit by 35%. In addition, the interest rate has dropped 6 percentage points, the deadlines are adapting to the needs of each project, and the procedures are more agile. To facilitate the trade of our products at competitive prices for both producers and the population, we are creating a network of markets that provides logistics services at international standards. I'll also mention the proposed restructuring of agriculture in the San Juan Valley, which was recently announced. This initiative will allow us to evolve from traditional crops to more profitable and competitive agricultural activities.</p><p>Our ultimate goal is to increase the production of the most important items of the basic food basket in order to guarantee the country's food sovereignty and promote exports. In 2013, a harvest of 10.6 million bushels of rice, 962,000 bushels of corn, more than 500 million pounds of legumes, 6 million bushels of roots and tubers, and nearly 9 million pounds of vegetables is expected.</p><p>The Special Fund for Agricultural Development (FEDA) was assigned an extraordinary item of Ps125 million for the last quarter of 2012. In 2013, that figure has reached Ps1 billion. This has led to more resources for more than 80,000 families for food production and the construction of small productive infrastructure such as greenhouses, beehives, poultry farms, fish ponds, and the like.</p><p>Our path to continue driving the Dominican Republic upward remains clear and resolute. The result of these measures and successes will be increased opportunities for the Dominican people and those investing in them. We look forward to the future with optimism and determination.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main goals that need to be achieved to put Haiti on the list of emerging economies by 2030?<br></h4><p>The main goals of the Haitian government are to put the country back on track toward economic growth. We are targeting growth of 6% per year based on public investment in key infrastructure sectors. Having said that, we also want to register significant GDP growth. Currently, the unemployment rate here is over 75%, and in rural areas it reaches almost 90%. Our key target is to reduce unemployment by at least 15 percentage points through creating jobs in the agriculture sector, re-launching agricultural production, and investing in production and irrigation so that Haiti can become more independent.</p><h4>What is the estimated public investment that you need to reach these goals?</h4><p>The target investment is about $2 billion per year for the next five years. We are currently able to generate $415 million per year, so there is still a gap that we have to compensate for with an increase in state revenues. The government has taken significant measures to tighten border control and fight against tax evasion. Only 3% of Haitians pay taxes, but we are trying to reverse that trend and bring it to at least 15%. At the same time, we are working with international partners to grant Haiti access to the lending market. Currently, Haiti only has access to grants, not loans, because of debt cancellation. We are working with international institutions to take out loans that will allow us to borrow and cover the difference as we invest in the country.</p><h4>What is your outlook in terms of Haiti's relationship with the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>The Martelly government has an excellent relationship with the Dominican administration. We are working to build on that excellent relationship in order to foster more investment here. Haiti can benefit from the expertise that the Dominican Republic has cultivated by building farms. We have to rebuild the entire country, but we lack sufficient resources and manpower to do so. Haiti looks toward its neighbor to work with us and bring both countries forward. In terms of tourism activities, we are looking at multiple destinations in collaboration with Dominican tourism investors to encourage investment in Haiti. We have had several interested parties already, but we are looking for more. The education sector is another area where we can benefit, as we have 700,000 students studying in Dominican schools. There is also a university here that was built by the Dominican government. We want to have exchange programs with the Dominican Republic to work on human resource development in our country. Right now, our customs teams are working with the Dominicans to formulate a common approach toward border protection, which can ultimately prevent the illegal smuggling of goods and the trafficking of illicit products. Security is an area that we can work together on. Job creation could also come about as Dominican investors come and establish businesses in Haiti. There are many incentives for Dominican businesses to come here, such as the HELP Act, tourism opportunities, infrastructure, and possibilities in the areas of construction and development. In these key sectors, the Dominican Republic can play an important role. We are very grateful for the relationship we have formed with the Dominican Republic, and we are going to continue to foster ties bearing in mind the mutual respect of both parties.</p><h4>What more is there to be achieved for Haiti and the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>We want to achieve two main goals: to strengthen our trade relationship and market specific key products. Haiti has excellent coffee and mangoes that we would like to export to the Dominican Republic, and we also want to introduce our indigenous beer, Prestige, to the Dominican market. There are several areas where we can improve trade relations with our neighbor, but the relationship we have is already strong. We anticipate that it will continue to be strong for years to come.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How can French investors take better advantage of the Dominican Republic's geostrategic positioning and its trade agreements with the US, Europe, Caribbean Community (CARICOM), and Central America?<br></h4><p>The economic relationship between France and the Dominican Republic, the second largest economy in the Caribbean after Puerto Rico, has undergone remarkable development since 2000. Initial investments made by a number of major French groups such as Orange, Carrefour, and Conforama have added several major projects such as the metro in Santo Domingo and water sanitation, which is being carried out by French enterprises the funding of which is provided in part by the French Development Agency (AFD). To go further together, which will result in an increase in the volume of business and the quality of the political dialogue between our two countries, we agree upon three objectives: first, to facilitate achieving major projects in development realized by the French groups, including Alstom, Thales, and VINCI; second, to extend the feasibility studies during the actual launch of their corresponding sites, particularly in the field of renewable energy (wind energy farms) or railway transportation (the link between Santo Domingo and Santiago); and third, to reinforce the exchange of business between France and the Dominican Republic through the Movement of the Enterprises of France (MEDEF) and the Chambers of Commerce by attracting the best French companies and their subsidiaries in Martinique, Guadeloupe, or French Guiana.</p><h4>France has shown its commitment to the Dominican Republic's development through cooperation in social, cultural, economic, and technological areas. Why is it important for France to support the Dominican Republic's development?</h4><p>There are multiple reasons. One is the proximity of the Dominican Republic with our Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), and another is its adjoining with Haiti and subsequent support after the earthquake of 2010. The country is also an International Francophile Organization (OIF) affiliate and has an observer headquarter office there, subscribes to the EU/CARIFORUM agreements and has a place in our regional system of military cooperation, a commitment to regional political forums, and a common history with France, which makes it an important partner for us. In many aspects, the Dominican Republic is emerging and France has every wish to accompany and support the path of its development.</p><h4>Earlier in 2012, the Regional Council of Guadeloupe signed a cooperation agreement to strengthen the commercial and economic bonds between the Dominican Republic and the Guadeloupe region. What opportunities are expected to arise from this?</h4><p>This agreement aims to strengthen the flow of trade and business opportunities within Guadeloupe. It is necessary to increase the amount of meetings between entrepreneurs and traders. In each economic sector where there is Dominican demand, the agreement is to mobilize the established French companies in Guadeloupe and provide a competitive and quality offer. It is the same in the field of urban development and planning, where the Guadeloupe region has an undeniable know-how that can be used toward the development of an urban community of greater Santo Domingo. However, it is left up to private sector operators to define the terms and areas where joint ventures could be considered.</p><h4>The year 2013 will be the “Year of the Dominican Republic" in Guadeloupe. What is the significance of this recognition?</h4><p>Political cooperation between the two countries has meaning only if it serves the reconciliation of people and culture, the strengthening of solidarity between the people, and the desire to live together in a stable, peaceful, and prosperous area. In this context, 2012 was the “Year of Guadeloupe" in the Dominican Republic, where I conducted several delegations myself while presiding over the Guadeloupe region. After being so well received by our Dominican friends, 2013 should be the “Year of the Dominican Republic" in Guadeloupe. With this series of events to be marked on the calendar, we aim to increase the visibility of our great neighbor in Guadeloupe by projecting the image of its economic and cultural vitality and strengthening the mutual understanding between Guadeloupians and Dominicans.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The majority, if not all franchises, host academies and winter teams in the Dominican Republic. How important is this country to Major League Baseball (MLB)?<br></h4><p>The Dominican Republic is very special to the MLB, for reasons that go beyond the staggering numbers of Dominican Major League and Minor League players. I believe baseball is a part of the Dominican Republic's identity. There is a shared passion among Dominican players and fans. Together, they are continuing a remarkable baseball tradition.</p><h4>The Dominican Republic produces more Major League players than any country outside of the US. What steps need to be taken to ensure significant representation of Dominicans throughout the League?</h4><p>The Dominican Republic produced 95 players on 2012 Opening Day rosters and disabled lists, representing its second highest total ever, behind only its 99 in 2007. The 95 players accounted for 11.1% of all Major League players. There continues to be a very strong pool of Dominican Minor League players as well. We need to continue to have an active presence in the Dominican Republic and to build on the great tradition of its people playing for Major League organizations. In order to do that, we must assist in providing the tools that our future players will need not just on the field but also away from it.</p><h4>How have the “Alderson reforms" improved talent development in the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>In 2009 Sandy Alderson led a committee that examined how we could improve our operations in the Dominican Republic. Sandy and his group produced a thorough, fascinating report on the various issues that existed and potential ways that we could address them. In March 2010, I asked Sandy to begin to implement many of his recommendations, and so he spent much of the year in the country, working in our office in Santo Domingo and leading our staff there. Sandy confronted longstanding challenges and focused on curbing the use of performance-enhancing substances, reducing attempts of age and identity fraud, and expanding educational opportunities. In all of these areas, our goal was to find solutions that, ultimately, benefited everyone. We have made great progress because of our renewed efforts, with Jorge Péréz-Dí­az continuing the initiatives that Sandy put in place, followed by our current leadership of Kim Ng and Rafael Pérez. Our registration processes and the levels of communication among the parties of the Dominican baseball establishment are much improved. We have seen reductions in cases of age and identity fraud and the use of illegal substances. We have increased the industry-wide exposure that amateur players have received by creating new showcases and amateur tournaments. We wanted to help our clubs protect their investments and to guide aspiring players to make the right choices for not just their careers, but their lives. There is more to accomplish, but I believe we have been very successful so far.</p><div class="quote">“I believe the Dominican Republic will remain an essential locale for the MLB in the next generation and a source for our global expansion."</div><h4>What is your view on the possibility of international expansion and the realignment of the major leagues, and what role could the Dominican Republic play in this vision?</h4><p>We are committed to maintaining baseball's remarkable international growth, and the Dominican Republic will continue to be a vital part of that. At the moment, expansion is not being contemplated by the MLB. We currently have 30 Major League Clubs and, in 2013, for the first time ever, we will move to 15 teams in both the American and National Leagues, as the Houston Astros will shift to the American League. I believe the Dominican Republic will remain an essential locale for the MLB for the next generation and a source for our global expansion.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What monetary policies has the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic (BCRD) implemented in recent years, and what elements have contributed to economic stability?<br></h4><p>The international economic crisis that began in 2008 caused a significant slowdown in global economic activity, which, combined with restrictions on capital flows, raised the need for a change in economic policies across the world. The spillover effect at the international level impacted the performance of major economies and, more noticeably, the eurozone. In line with what happened in developed economies and in most of Latin America, the Dominican Republic implemented counter-cyclical fiscal and monetary policies in order to stimulate economic growth in the short term in a low-inflation environment. In effect, from 2009, given the unfavorable external situation, the BCRD adopted a more flexible monetary policy, reducing its monetary policy rate (MPR) by 550 basis points to lower the overnight rate from 9.5% to 4.0%, and decreased the reserve requirements ratio by 2.5 percentage points. The expansionary monetary policy measures were accompanied by a strong fiscal stimulus during 2H2009 and 1H2010. Public spending also increased, particularly investment, as part of the macroeconomic strategy defined in the IMF Stand-by Agreement. These measures had the expected effect, stimulating consumption and investment in the public and private sectors so that GDP grew at rates of 3.5% in 2009, the highest in Latin America, and 7.8% in 2010, fulfilling in both years the inflation targets set in the BCRD's monetary program. Since late 2010 the BCRD, in a pro-active manner, chose to move to a more neutral monetary policy stance. It is now less expansive and aimed at bringing economic growth up to its potential. Between October 2010 and May 2011, the BCRD gradually increased its policy rate by 275 basis points, from 4% to 6.75%, while from May 2011 until May 2012, the MPR remained unchanged at 6.75%. It is important to note that since the last quarter of 2011, a major fiscal stimulus was verified in the form of an increase in the rate of public investment over that period, associated with the electoral process verified in May 2012. Later, in the second half of 2012, in the absence of inflationary pressure, weak domestic demand, and a fall in private sector credit, the BCRD chose to modify its monetary stance by reducing the MPR by 175 basis points, dropping from 6.75% to 5.0% between May and August 2012. At the end of 2012, it is expected that economic growth will stand at around 4% and inflation well below the lower limit of the inflation target of 5.5%, +/-1%. Monetary policy, combined with fiscal policy, has served as a counterweight in handling the international crisis, or at least mitigating its effects on the Dominican economy. Keeping the expectations of economic agents anchored to sound policymaking created certainty in investors, both local and foreign. An important element is the strength of the financial system. This sector was not contaminated with the toxic assets that led to the global crisis, and throughout the period of the international crisis has reflected high levels of solvency, capitalization, and profitability. This is mainly due to the implementation of laws and regulations by the Monetary Board, in line with core Basel principles and international best practices.</p><h4>What measures have been taken to control the Dominican peso's volatility on the international currency markets?</h4><p>The relative stability of the peso with respect to the US dollar is due to several factors. First, the Dominican economy has seen a greater influx of hard currency, mainly FDI, while exports have been recovering. Furthermore, it is important to note that tourism revenue, which is the main source of foreign exchange, has remained on a growth curve to the extent that foreign visitors to our country have diversified. Although the arrival of European tourists has slowed, this has been more than offset by new tourists from South America, especially from Brazil, Venezuela, and Argentina. On the other hand, the stability of the Dominican peso has benefited from  the certainty of the macroeconomic stability associated with the implementation of sound economic policies. Additionally, the BCRD has carried out exchange intervention operations in order to mitigate any volatility that could potentially affect the inflation target of this institution, given the persistent high level of pass-through from exchange rate to inflation.</p><h4>What recent developments have there been in interest rates, and what are your projections for the 2012-13 period?</h4><p>From 2009, in an unfavorable external environment and under low inflationary pressures, the BCRD applied a counter-cyclical monetary policy, generating a significant reduction in market interest rates. One point to note is that if one takes into account the level where the market interest rate was at the beginning of the monetary stimulus, one could even say that the Dominican Republic was the country that achieved the highest reduction in rates in the region. The lending rate, in weighted average, declined by 14.43 percentage points, dropping from 25.17% in January 2009 to 10.74% in August 2010, thereby benefiting the private sector, which had access to historically low-interest loans. Toward the end of 2010, low-interest rates caused an acceleration of private credit, generating a strong momentum in domestic demand. In the context of rising international oil prices and other commodities, it became clear that higher credit growth could lead to excess demand in the economy, bringing economic growth above its potential. In order to avoid large deviations from the inflation target and maintain sound macroeconomic conditions, the BCRD determined to withdraw monetary stimuli implemented during the crisis, and so adopt a more neutral monetary policy stance, reflected by the gradual increases process in the MPR. These measures are gradually transmitted to market rates, which increased in stages, although below the levels of pre-crisis period. However, as of May 2012, with the reduction of the MPR, market rates began to show signs of reduction.</p><h4>What is the BCRD's stance regarding the new agreement with the IMF?</h4><p>In the last decade, the Dominican Republic has had two Stand-By Arrangements with the IMF. The first was in 2005 to restore macroeconomic stability and the health of the financial system after the local banking crisis of 2003-2004. The second agreement was in 2009, in order to try to mitigate the impact of the international crisis and allow the country greater access to international credit. In both agreements, significant progress was made in terms of the implementation of sound macroeconomic policies, the strengthening of the financial system, and the restoration of economic growth with low inflation and various structural reforms. In current times of significant restrictions on public finances due to an expansionary fiscal policy implemented in late 2011, combined with falling tax revenues and higher energy subsidies, it has generated deviations in fiscal deficits in 2011 and 2012. The Dominican authorities, including the BCRD, are aware that the external environment and the current fiscal conditions pose a huge challenge. That is why they favor a new agreement with the IMF to support the government's efforts to stabilize the fiscal accounts through a set of long-term measures to sustain macroeconomic stability. In this regard, they have been working on the design and implementation of an economic program, accompanied by the IMF, to address these issues. In addition, the current government has an important structural reform agenda, especially in the fiscal sector, where it has been setting up a comprehensive reform incorporating revenue increases, spending cuts, and institutional strengthening elements. This reform would ensure fiscal sustainability over time, as well as a downward trend in the public debt levels as a ratio of GDP. The program also includes a series of government measures that will help improve the financial conditions of the energy sector and reduce overtime transfers to this sector by the central government. In addition, the development of a comprehensive social inclusion program to strengthen poverty reduction and to create jobs, favoring social spending, especially in education, has been proposed.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the business performance of Seguros Universal in 2011?<br></h4><p>Seguros Universal was established in 1964, and over these 48 years the company has expanded and consolidated its leadership, along with the development of the Dominican insurance market. Today, our sector is stronger thanks to the implementation of solvency and liquidity margins and the role of reinsurance companies; all major foreign reinsurers operate in the country and have widely contributed to make the insurance market very competitive at the international level. Additionally, our nation has enjoyed macroeconomic stability for the last five to seven years, enabling it to develop both socially and economically, thus furthering the development of the sector. The insurance industry has experienced real growth recently, particularly in 2011 and 2012, with its premium volume incrementing over 10%. Seguros Universal continues to be a role model in the industry, both in terms of market share and product portfolio. Our company offers such an assortment of options that compare favorably to what consumers can find in the most developed countries. Over the years, the insurance sector has become healthier from both a financial and economic perspective, as ascertained by the ratings assigned to many of its members by internationally recognized firms. For example, our company is rated A by Fitch. Universal currently maintains a 28% market share, and such a figure is relevant because the closest competitors stand at 17% and 18%. The company's main growth in recent years has been in life and health thanks to our pioneering performance when it comes to product innovation. Seguros Universal is highly committed to providing the best standards and quality of service to its clients. We are embracing the country's new wave of foreign investors responsible for the development of state-of-the-art infrastructure projects, many of which rely on our market expertise. Our company is 100% privately and locally owned, and we are proud of our Dominican character, which has permitted us to compete head to head in the insurance market place with predominant international players.</p><h4>Who are the main shareholders of Seguros Universal?</h4><p>Three partners constituted the company in its origin, and in 1985 Grupo Popular, a local financial group, acquired Seguros Universal. In 2004, following an economic and financial crisis affecting the country, Grupo Popular sold the company to a diversity of Dominican shareholders. We are a corporation in which no individual person controls more than a 15% of the firm, enabling us to have a consensus decision-making process at all levels. Today, the company has over 200 stockholders, many of which are our employees. In line with our corporate identity, we are highly committed to implementing transparency across all our undertakings.</p><h4>What makes the Dominican Republic an attractive destination for reinsurance companies?</h4><p>In the earlier days, many international insurers were established in our insurance market, leaving behind a footprint that has been an influential force in the evolution of our industry. Most of these companies exited the market during difficult economic periods of high monetary devaluations and the introduction of foreign exchange controls. This paved the way for the formation of Dominican insurers, who in a short period of time took over the control of the business aided by the knowledge inherited from their predecessors. The exposure to natural catastrophic perils along with strong economic development and political stability makes the Dominican Republic a very engaging market for reinsurance companies that are attracted by the relatively larger volume of premiums generated when compared to other Central American countries. In our particular case, Seguros Universal is the biggest private insurance company in the Caribbean and Central American region (excluding Puerto Rico), and today the only company that is larger than us in terms of premium volume is the Costa Rican state-owned insurance company.</p><div class="quote">“Our company is 100% privately and locally owned, and we are proud of our Dominican character."</div><h4>Is Seguros Universal looking into using the Dominican stock exchange as a financial resource?</h4><p>We have just established a holding company, Grupo Universal to encompass all our affiliates under one umbrella; Seguros Universal, ARS Universal (a health insurance entity), Universal Asistencia, (an assistance service provider), and Suplidora Propartes, (an automobile spare parts provider). We are currently considering diversifying our activities with an investment and trust fund management companies. The holding entity is expected to close the year with a turnover of Ps12 billion, and we believe that the Dominican Republic continues to offer many investment opportunities. The process of expanding our activities and consolidating the holding group are key steps to moving into the international market. Of course, any such decision will have to be accompanied by a capitalization process.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Dominican Republic has received over $14 billion in investment in the last seven years. What current economic factors make the Dominican Republic attractive for foreign capital?<br></h4><p>A sound business climate, political and economic stability, a strategic location, solid legal framework for foreign investment, modern transportation infrastructure, and advanced and reliable telecommunications have been some of the main reasons for the Dominican Republic's success in being recognized as the top recipient of FDI in the Caribbean. According to the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC). In 2011, the country accounted for 53.3% of total foreign investment registered in the Caribbean, and was one of the main recipients of foreign capital in Latin America. The remarkable performance of the Dominican economy and the competitive advantages offered by our country for doing business have provided an increased flow of FDI in the productive sectors nationwide. To put this variable into perspective, total FDI received in 2012 amounted to $3.5 billion, representing a record figure for our country. Furthermore, foreign investment has been one of the main driving forces of the Dominican economy in recent years due largely in part to the macroeconomic stability and the positive growth rates that have been sustained, transforming us into one of strongest economies in the Caribbean and one of the most important in the Latin American region. In 2010, the Dominican economy was ranked fifth in overall performance, and according to the ECLAC, one of the least volatile in the region with a 5.9% average GDP growth rate. In 2011, the Dominican Republic grew 4.5%, the same as the regional average, and above the average growth of the world economy (3.9%), according to the IMF.</p><h4>The CEI-RD's “Dominicana Exporta" program aims to increase the country's exports to $12 billion by 2013. How is this plan being implemented?</h4><p>For the past eight years, there has been a steady increase in Dominican exports, although progress was briefly interrupted by the global economic crisis that shook markets in 2008-2009. However, in 2011, the export of Dominican goods reached its highest historical value, amounting to $8.5 billion. Interestingly, the make-up of our product lines has also changed substantially over the years. While sugar represented close to 70% of our foreign earnings three decades ago, nowadays what we call traditional products (sugar, coffee, cocoa, and tobacco leaves) represent only 7%; minerals account for 5%, and 88% of our exports are non-traditional products, including fruits and vegetables, gourmet and organic products, agro-industrial goods, and manufactured items. The Dominican Republic is becoming known for its capacity to produce world-class goods and services. In 2011, we exported more than 3,150 different product lines to over 173 countries around the world. As a policy measure, and following the strategic guidelines of President Medina, the CEI-RD aims to support development opportunities for small businesses to boost economic growth and increase exports. the CEI-RD focuses on those productive sectors and aims toward the internationalization of SMEs, which constitute over 90% of existing companies registered in our country and are also responsible for the creation of more than 1.06 million jobs.</p><h4>What other sectors are you targeting?</h4><p>There are many sectors that have received significant investment from foreign sources in last six years, such as the transportation sector, which reached FDI totals of $682.5 million, the financial sector, with a value of $642.8 million, and free zones, which received over $487 million. In 2006, there were only 12 companies that had a total of 4,543 agents and 3,800 seats. Currently, it has been estimated that there are between 30,000 and 33,000 agents employed in the industry and approximately 27,400 seats. The projections are that the sector will grow by over 80% in the next five years, anticipating that more than 60,000 agents will be employed in the industry by 2016.</p><div class="quote">“The Dominican Republic is becoming known for its capacity to produce world-class goods and services."</div>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Revista Mercado celebrates its 20th anniversary in 2013. What has been the secret behind the publication's success over these two decades?<br></h4><p>Our editorial format has strictly focused on covering the main activities of the business world. We do serious and objective journalism that works as a consulting and update tool for business-related sectors.</p><h4>The publication has a monthly edition and several special editions. Why did you decide to cover such niche markets?</h4><p>Special editions are basically to fill the space of the long-awaited “rankings." Mercado Media Network has been conducting studies that reflect the image and behavior of companies within their corporate performance for a decade already. In this context, we publish five special editions dedicated to update companies within specific business areas. The surveys aimed at measuring the “Most Admired Companies" is our most awaited special edition, for it sets out which are the most innovative and economically powerful companies, with higher managerial capacity, and the most prominent in terms of social responsibility. At the same time, the two editions of “Women of Power and Success" presents the ranking of the most outstanding women in their work areas reflecting their commitment and leadership, as well as their efforts. The special issue on “Companies You Would Like To Work For" is a valuable contribution to human resources. Finally, we make a special edition on different lifestyles, which has a larger format than usual.</p><h4>Revista Mercado has developed partnerships and exclusive representations with key international institutions such as The Economist and Harvard Business School, and it circulates by subscription in New York, Miami, and Puerto Rico. What are the main lines of your international strategy?</h4><p>Since its inception, the magazine aimed at going beyond national borders. During the first five years, we focused on positioning the brand locally and then, with the first publishing partnership with the publishing house Crain Communications, our internationalization process took off. We always believed that international publishing alliances with key and leading publications would strengthen our content proposal, making us more competitive and positioning our brand as a reference publication within the business world in the Caribbean region. For example, in 2013 we successfully entered Haiti, and we plan to further expand our presence to other Caribbean islands too.</p><div class="quote">“In such a globalized and competitive world, it is essential to recognize the work of those entrepreneurs who stand out for their contributions."</div><h4>Revista Mercado annually awards outstanding Dominican entrepreneurs for their efforts. How relevant is giving public recognition to certain figures from the Dominican business world?</h4><p>In such a globalized and competitive world, it is essential to recognize the work of those entrepreneurs who stand out for their contributions and have contributed to the economy of our country. Many of these entrepreneurs have something in common: attitude and character. They serve as an example of businessmen enjoying a triumph recognized by the community.</p><h4>What are some of your future plans?</h4><p>We live with constant challenges, for being in the print media means that we must prepare ourselves to live up to the update that the digital world brings. With the arrival of our 20th anniversary, we realize the strength of our product. We expect to continue expanding our presence abroad and sign new publishing partnerships and alliances with new media formats, which will enable us to continue being the leading source of information among the business world. We recently diversified our market by acquiring the franchise of Hello in the Dominican Republic, and in the last few years we have further strengthened and consolidated our position. Our main goal is to become a multi-media company.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What will be the impact of the EPA, and what unique advantages does it offer in the current global economic context?<br></h4><p>The EPA will help the CARIFORUM region grow and develop economically and sustainably. It will improve conditions for business to flourish and to create even more highly skilled jobs. It will help the Caribbean move up the value chain and rely less on traditional exports, such as bananas and sugar, by creating new trading opportunities in the goods and services sectors, such as business and financial, or tourism including health-related and cultural services industries. The agreement helps consolidate the regional market and establish a transparent and predictable economic framework. This will make the region more competitive and in the end more attractive for investment.</p><h4>How has the EPA developed the EU's relationship with Latin America and the Caribbean?</h4><p>The EPA is a pioneer trade-for-development partnership between the EU and its 15 CARIFORUM partners, which include the Caribbean Community and the Dominican Republic. This comprehensive agreement will consolidate and expand our long-standing relations with the region. At the same time, the EPA will support the Caribbean's own regional integration efforts, which are critical to its development. The EPA replaces the previous trading regime that was based on unilateral trade preferences for goods. All in all, the EPA establishes a true partnership combining the full range of trade instruments to promote sustainable economic growth and investment in the CARIFORUM region.</p><h4>Which sectors or industries do you feel represent the most potential for EU-Dominican Republic trade relations?</h4><p>In my view, there are many areas that have great potential for trade between the EU and the Dominican Republic. Again, it is not appropriate for me to “pick winners." Tourism has been a major area of activity, which is no surprise given the beautiful beaches, marvelous waters of the Caribbean Sea, fantastic nature, and great cultural sights that this country offers. Certainly, this sector can be further developed. The Dominican Republic has a well-known strong capacity to grow tropical fruit and vegetables, for which it has promoted good outlets through fair trade schemes. But given the geographic position, the specific features of the country, the level of skills, and its other assets, it would seem to me that other sub-sectors are highly promising as well: music or cultural industries could be developed, so could the education or health-based services. On the other hand, there may also be opportunities to produce goods and services for neighboring markets on the American continent. You can also develop to your advantage the region's linguistic assets. You speak languages common to so many countries that are accessible via the EPA.</p><div class="quote">“There are many areas that have great potential for trade between the EU and the Dominican Republic."</div><h4>How is immigration to the region beneficial to the European, Latin American, and Caribbean economies?</h4><p>European individuals and companies alike certainly take considerable interest in the region. The EPA will help to put the Caribbean more firmly on the map for EU investors, and the region needs to attract more investment to fuel growth and development. That is what the EPA sets out to do: create better conditions for investors in the Caribbean, be they local or of foreign origin, in order to promote the region's economic development. Today's globalized economies rely on an international division of labor and businesses seek to source parts or tasks from the most competitive location. Inward investment therefore has the potential to be beneficial to both the Caribbean region and the EU. Such investment will create jobs, enables the transfer of skills and technology, and drive economic growth and development in the region. Of course, these investments intend to make the parent company more competitive and profitable. As a result, the company will also be able to create more jobs and wealth both in Europe and in the region  long term.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In 2011, Banco del Progreso saw a 24.1% increase in total assets, a 27.3% increase in its gross loan portfolio, and a 2.3% decrease in the NPL ratio. To what do you attribute these results?<br></h4><p>These indicators demonstrate the dynamism of Banco del Progreso in 2011, which confirms the trajectory of healthy growth that we have achieved over the past three years. This strong growth has been possible partly in thanks to the commercial policies that have focused on the development of financial products, which is consistent with the situation in the Dominican Republic, as well as the greater involvement of our business in the competitive Dominican financial market. The figures have positioned the bank to continue capturing a large share of the market. Our efforts will continue until we achieve the market position that Banco del Progreso deserves.</p><h4>How has Banco del Progreso's recent acquisition of Banco Capital's assets and liabilities strengthened your position in the country?</h4><p>With this transaction in 2011, Banco del Progreso increased its assets by Ps765 million and its deposits by Ps497 million, solidifying our profitability while at the same time permitting us to lay the foundations for a consolidated leadership that the numbers prove we are capable of. The purchase of Banco Capital not only had a positive impact on our financial indications, but also made an internal impact on the management of our services, which created a corporate unit called “División de Negocios Empresariales." With this unit, we are serving business sectors in the areas of industry, commerce, construction, and transport, among others.</p><h4>Banco del Progreso was ranked as a BBB bank with a positive outlook by Feller Rate. What strategies have defined the bank's risk management?</h4><p>As clearly indicated by Feller Rate in its move to grade Banco del Progreso's investment rate at BBB, this rating reflected our engagement in an internal transformation and competitive repositioning.</p><p>Feller Rate considers that the basis is robust as it sustains the achievements of the bank, and that they comply with all of the liquidity and solvency requirements that the prudential standards of the regulator require. We are also implementing projects and systems that guarantee the minimizing of risk and maintaining sustainable growth strategies in our business endeavors.</p><h4>What are your plans for continued expansion of the American Express network in the country?</h4><p>First of all, we succeeded in the renewal of our contract with American Express and Lí­nea Centurion for an additional 10 years, being the only business entity in Latin America to achieve exclusivity with the company. In this way, we will be able to continue consolidating the presence of American Express in our markets as an attractive payment medium, mainly due to its flexibility, loyalty system, and points that never expire. In addition to these benefits, we offer a product called the Suma CCN American Express® card, which allows customers to save. It is an innovative card that allows clients to receive savings while shopping in commercial establishments of various types, from supermarkets, bookstores, and home goods stores to gas stations and pharmacies. In just one year, customers who have obtained this card can win savings of up to Ps30 million. Recently, American Express recognized Banco del Progreso for having created this card, which represents an innovative program in terms of marketing, and because it has triggered the exceptional performance of local business. A third important aspect in the continued expansion of the American Express brand is the launch of the first American Express debit card, which, like the credit card, will have a Membership Loyalty Rewards program, making this form of payment method available for the first time in the Dominican Republic. With all of these initiatives, American Express is assuming a new position in the local credit card market, something the company has achieved on the basis of the prestige and service quality that it is able to offer.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why did Colombian company Seguros Sura decide to invest in the Dominican Republic?<br></h4><p>The origin of the group is in insurance. It is a company with more than 67 years of history in the Colombian market and is the leading company in that market. Three years ago, the company started the process of expanding throughout the region. Seven years ago, it bought a company in Panama, and in 2011 the group bought two companies: one in El Salvador and Proseguros. The superintendency of the Dominican Republic issued the authorization for the takeover on July 1, 2011. It has a solid reputation in the region and is focused on sustained profitability based on attracting and retaining customers by offering value-added insurance solutions. It has strong human resources and excellent risk and capital management records.</p><h4>Why did Vicini Group sell Proseguros, now Seguros Sura?</h4><p>It was an attractive business opportunity for the Vicini Group enabling it to continue its focus on other sectors in its portfolio, such as manufacturing, energy, and real estate.</p><h4>What have been the achievements after the first year of operations under the new owners?</h4><p>We billed more than $74 million in 2011, and have a 10.5% market share. Our current budget forecasts 6% growth over 2012. As of July 31, 2012, we grew 4% more than the forecast. We are among the top four insurance companies in the market</p><div class="quote">“All of our insurance solutions are designed with our client's needs in mind."</div><h4>To achieve this 6% growth, what markets are you targeting and what products are you planning?</h4><p>In total, 48% of our revenue comes from fire insurance, 25% comes from automobile products, and 16% comes from life and health insurance, with 86% of our company focused on property and casualty and 16% on life and health products.</p><h4>Why did you decide to concentrate on the corporate sector?</h4><p>One of the goals in this market is to accelerate the penetration of insurance, which is very low in Latin America. In the Dominican Republic, it is close to 1.4% of GDP. Innovating and creating products that will capture the attention of the customers is important. We do this through alternative channels such as bank insurance or affinity groups.</p><h4>Taking into consideration the experience and position of the company in Colombia, what innovations did you bring to the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>An insurance contract includes a host of assumed responsibilities. However, the company always works to add value to different products. Through our automobile insurance solution, this value-added could be the services we offer to the customer such as roadside and home assistance. The company is very focused on the client and is completely service oriented. This culture of service has been developed over a period of years. Over the last year, we have been focused on aligning with Segura Sura's corporate culture. The main resource, we believe, is human capital. Pricing is not the only issue—the product and service are also important. We aim to identify customer needs, add value, and develop long-term relationships with clients. Usually, customers in the personal sector move from company to company. We want to avoid that situation. The sector has been focused on corporate clients; we are oriented to multi-segment and multi-product offerings. The usual channel is local brokers, but we have worked to diversify using our expert sales force and the latest technology. Now, customers and brokers can connect with our database through the internet and obtain quotations. We recently introduced a tool that the customer can use to go directly to the auto repair garage and from there make a claim. That is new for the industry. In the past, customers had to go to our office or to a broker. They can go directly to the auto repair shop and open the claim there.</p><h4>How many offices do you have in the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>We have offices in Santo Domingo, Santiago, La Romana, San Pedro de Macorí­s, and Las Terrenas. We cover the rest of the country through agencies and brokers that work with us.</p><h4>Who are your main suppliers in business?</h4><p>Our main supplier is our reinsurance network, which is very important in this business. We have strong relationships with the top reinsurers in the world, such as Swiss Re, Transatlantic Re, and Hannover Re Group. The Dominican Republic is exposed to hurricanes and earthquakes; reinsurance enables us to share the risk in order to provide our clients the protection they need.</p><h4>Are there any specific products designed for the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>All our insurance solutions are designed with our client's needs in mind. Let's say for example business and homeowner's insurance; due to the fact that the country is exposed to hurricanes and tropical storms, there is high demand for this type of coverage. Our reinsurance backing is designed to take into account the nature of the country. We are generally conservative. We use A-rated reinsurers to guarantee the best coverage. Our reinsurers have been working with us for many years.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the competitiveness of the country's insurance sector?</h4><p>Presently, there are approximately 34 insurance companies. However, the top six companies control 85% of the market. The insurance sector in this country has mainly been developed in the corporate sector making it highly competitive and price sensitive. Therefore, premiums have a tendency to get discounted in order to maintain or attract new customers. The current government is currently working on regulations in order to promote adequate premium calculations. We believe that future opportunities will stem from economic growth and insuring first-time clients in the personal segment. We have experienced a compound annual growth rate of 30% in life insurance over the last four years. Moreover, only 6% of our revenues came from life insurance six years ago—now this share has climbed to 16%. Our brokers are very happy that Seguros Sura entered the market because they felt that the industry needed a change, and that the personal segment had great growth potential.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>IMCA represents some of the world's leading machinery brands in the Dominican Republic. How did it achieve this position?<br></h4><p>The founders of the company wanted to help grow the country after the end of World War II. They opened IMCA with the idea of representing machinery that would help create infrastructure for the country, such as roads, aqueducts, and buildings, as well as improve the agriculture sector in order to feed Dominicans. Over the years, we have mainly provided services to the mining and construction industries. Caterpillar and John Deere also develop products that serve the agriculture market. As Caterpillar builds smaller machinery, we also work with local contractors to build apartments and houses in the Dominican Republic.</p><h4>How do you see the development of the mining industry in the country, and how significant is it for your business?</h4><p>In the last three years, mining has meant about 30% of our business. Around 30% of my employees are also directly linked to the mining sector in the Dominican Republic. Technology wise, miners are very strict with time utilization. We need to have well-trained technicians, which is why IMCA is the founder of a private initiative for technical education in the Dominican Republic. We have improved the overall level of the technicians, driven by the needs of the mining sector in the country. Most mining is carried out by Canadian companies in the Dominican Republic, and these companies also have operations in several countries around the world that meet international standards. In response, we have to align our level of services to worldwide standards. For the last three to four years, we have also incorporated IT into the products we provide.</p><h4>How much has the company invested in technical education programs?</h4><p>So far, we have invested $2.5 million, and over the last five years alone we have allocated $1.2 million to train teachers and open chemistry, physics, and IT labs. IMCA has also provided technical material to help instructors teach these concepts in a contextual way. That is why we hired a company called Center for Occupational Research (CORD) from Waco, Texas. In the same technical school, we are providing this training to all students regardless of their specializations. This particular vocational school has seven specializations, but we only hire for the internal combustion specialization. For the internal combustion specialization, we made a $1.3 million investment by building a service shop inside the school. Now, when students come to work at IMCA, they have already practiced in a shop that is equal to the one we have here, with the same tools. On top of this $2.5 million investment, Caterpillar from the US donated 10 18-liter engines, a motor grader, a backhoe loader, and an excavator. Before we hired graduates from this vocational school, it would take us 18 months to have them be able to perform world-class standard jobs in our company, but now it only takes us three months.</p><div class="quote">“In the last three years, mining has meant about 30% of our business."</div><h4>What are the latest technological solutions that IMCA has brought to the country?</h4><p>This is technology that is available worldwide, meaning satellite and GPS connectivity. Basically, you can perform prospecting on the place that you will mine. That prospecting is built into the equipment computer and into the hydraulics of the equipment. Rather than using a geologist to help the operator of the machinery, the machinery itself will display whatever needs to be excavated in red on a panel inside the tractor. When it turns green, the job is done. It is a more efficient process. That technology also helps notify the machinery administration when the machine is reaching maintenance time. Also, if there is an alarm on the machine for low fuel, low lubricant, or high temperature, it will also be sent to the laptop of the administrator. It will help in performing preventative maintenance on a piece of machinery, rather than repairing it after failure.</p><h4>Is the projected demand for other construction activities also growing?</h4><p>We have fantastic prospects for infrastructure. This is a country of 10 million people, and most of the infrastructure needs to be improved and adapted to the projected growth of the Dominican Republic. People think it is going to continue growing above 5% over the next decade. We also have Haiti right next to us, and we provide services and goods for at least 4 million Haitians. We send dairy products, agriculture products, plastic goods, and more. This is an economy that not only produces for the Dominican people, but also for at least 4 million Haitians and for another 5 million tourists that stay in the Dominican Republic for at least two weeks every year.</p><h4>Since 2011, IMCA also sells machinery for the harvest of sugar cane. What are the prospects for this business line?</h4><p>CAMECO used to be a US-based company, and John Deere did not make any products for the sugar cane industry. It purchased CAMECO, but the company is no longer called CAMECO, it is called John Deere Sugar Products. In the past, we were only selling wheeled tractors to the sugar industry, but not harvesters or loaders. It is not a very big market compared to the total contribution of the rest of the markets that we serve. There are plenty of workers that still do some of the labor that is required in this industry by hand here. This is the reason why the mechanization of the sugar industry is not as it should be.</p><h4>What are IMCA's advantages for expansion in the region?</h4><p>We have a regional label on the company, as it provides services to both the Dominican Republic and Jamaica. Whatever we do is a standard in both countries. IMCA does not have a separate set of rules for each country. When we talk to Caterpillar, John Deere, Michelin, or Exxon-Mobil, we are clearly telling them that we want to have more territory in the region. That is the reason why we have the regional label. If we are going to be in Cuba, Puerto Rico, or Haiti, we will provide the same level of service that we provide today. Because of laws in the US, we cannot act as a dealer for certain products in Cuba. However, when it is clear that it is good to go, then we will pursue that market too.</p><h4>Why can the Dominican Republic be considered a natural market for the Michelin and BF Goodrich brands?</h4><p>In the Dominican Republic we have what we call natural markets, which means mining, construction, industry, commerce, and agriculture. It was a very good alignment to represent Michelin and BF Goodrich, because in the natural market they basically buy everything that we sell due to our credibility and the quality of our products. Michelin is number one and BF Goodrich is a company that is 100% owned by Michelin. The retail market is where we are really working on deepening our penetration of the market. In 2012 alone, we have opened eight Michelin service centers. We run four of them, and the other four are concessions to independent companies.</p><p>The automotive market has always been strong, but we also import double the amount of used vehicles. It is a growing market, and automotive dealers are very strong in the Dominican Republic. As soon as the buying power of the average Dominican grows, and the taxes are lowered, we are going to see more cars being sold. Since we have been representing Michelin over the last two years and BF Goodrich for the last year, we have a great deal of room to increase our market share.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main consequences of the 40% energy losses that the country suffers from, and what actions are to be taken now?<br></h4><p>To reduce energy losses is one of our fundamental objectives for the recovery of the sector. A decade ago, the level of losses was around 46%-48%. In 10 years, we have reduced that to 38%-40%. The slow progress can be justified by the inconsistency of investment. There are points at which progress could be made, but if the investment is stopped then the problem comes back. In the last two or three years, with the help of international organizations like the World Bank and the IDB, we have undertaken major projects that have resulted in significant loss reductions. The result of these projects may be seen in 1Q2013, and the impact on losses will be considerable.</p><h4>How important is the change to the energy matrix for the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>The generation costs are quite high, and this is one of the main obstacles for the solution of the problem. Approximately 45%-50% of our plants use fossil fuel generation. The current oil price makes generation costs too high for us. In the future, our focus will be primarily to change the facilities and direct them to gas and coal. We will try to move to the greatest extent away from energy derived from oil.</p><h4>What is the main reason for the need to review  contracts with power generators?</h4><p>The contracts were designed in times when the price of fuel was very low, meaning the existing indexation formulas that have internal contracts are a distortion of the current price level. The formula allows for fuel indexing and a marginalization of those who are on contracts. These are the weaknesses of the contracts and they should be adjusted.</p><div class="quote">“We have major hydroelectric projects under development, and we consider it an important factor in reducing costs."</div><h4>What is CDEEE's estimate of the investment needed in power generation for the country?</h4><p>Right now, we are proposing an open tender for a 900-MW coal-fired plant, and a gas-fired plant of 600 MW. This is an investment that can easily reach $3 billion. We will gradually introduce a 600-MW coal-fired plant, representing an investment of $1 billion-$1.2 billion.</p><h4>What will be the model of contract for this project?</h4><p>The idea is to make a turnkey project, meaning the government tenders the project and whoever wins will manage the funding, implementation, and additional facilities, such as constructing transmission lines, adapting the port, and installing coal storage facilities.</p><h4>What projects will the government fund in the power sector?</h4><p>Right now, there are loans that are being used to rehabilitate the networks that were granted by the IDB and World Bank. The government has no perspective on borrowing for investment in the sector. However, there was the need to make an investment in generation before the end of 2012. That was an internal operation where the energy sector and local banks worked together in order to make a substantial investment before the end of the year.</p><h4>What investments are being made to exploit the hydroelectric potential of the country?</h4><p>We have major hydroelectric projects under development, and we consider it an important factor in reducing costs, so we attach great importance to them. The current administration has made significant progress in the recovery of dams that were practically disabled. One of those units had gone eight years without operating, and these are the dams that will be rehabilitated. At this rate, the dams will provide an important contribution to our recovery.</p><h4>What are the prospects for 2013?</h4><p>We inherited a large domestic debt and a budget of $270 million. That assignment fell far short of the actual deficit in the sector. In 2013, there will be a bigger budget to cover the deficit, and that will help us to focus on solving the problem. The close of 2012 is going to be traditional; there will be nothing new. There are expectations of a substantial improvement in 2013, in compliance with the commitments we have with generators as well as with suppliers.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the core plans the Ministry is implementing to strengthen strategic sectors of the economy?<br></h4><p>President Medina clearly stated in his inaugural speech that the development of both micro firms and SMEs in the country is the strategic axis of the industrial and commercial sectors. Today, this type of enterprise composes 90% of the Dominican industrial park, while almost 56% of employment is produced in the informal sector. We have to keep in mind that people working in this shadow market earn between 30% and 45% less than people employed in the formal market. The development of these sectors will come with fairer and more stable job opportunities for our population, and is part of President Medina's plan to create as many as 400,000 jobs for our population. One of the main problems micro firms and SMEs face is barriers when trying to access a loan, and for that reason we are in the process of identifying potential new financial resources for these enterprises. In this regard, we have established a fund of Ps4 billion and created the Solidarity Bank, which aims to attend to the needs of micro firms. We expect to contribute to the development of a wide range of companies from different industrial and commercial segments. I would like to add that this strategy will also boost activity among large and corporate companies, because many of them are directly related to the activity of micro firms and SMEs. In addition, we plan to introduce a number of tax amendments at the industrial level and institutionally reform the Ministry in order to create sector-specific vice-ministers to better implement strategic policies. In fact, we plan to establish a new Energy and Mining Ministry, areas that are currently under our influence, due to the importance of these sectors for national development.</p><h4>What initiatives does the Ministry aim to develop in order to boost exports and strengthen trade policies?</h4><p>The Dominican Republic has four free trade agreements (FTAs) in force. Therefore, most of our trade is liberalized through these agreements. Also, we aim to reach a similar agreement with Haiti, our second most important export market at the moment, with an average trade balance of $1.3 billion a year both in the formal and informal markets. We would also like to develop closer ties and perhaps commercial agreements with countries like Canada and Chile, or accede to regional entities like Mercosur. At the moment, we are also trying to boost mining exports, a sector labeled as strategic by the government. For example, the implementation of the Pueblo Viejo mining project will add more than $2 billion to our overall export figures in 2013, which represents a 20% increase in our exports. The government also aims to provide continuity to the Export Processing Zone (EPZ) scheme to further attract FDI into the Dominican Republic, especially in the manufacturing sphere.</p><h4>What have been the main advantages of the Dominican Republic—Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR)?</h4><p>It has consolidated some favorable import-export tariffs that the country individually had with some of the region's states. If we had not taken part in such a scheme, we would have lost this favorable treatment, and the Dominican Republic would be at a competitive disadvantage with its regional counterparts. Also, it encouraged an exporting culture in the country and increased the presence of Dominican products in the US, a country that today receives 80% of our exports.</p><div class="quote">“We plan to introduce a number of tax amendments at the industrial level."</div><h4>What is the potential behind developing closer ties with China?</h4><p>Over the last few years, we have intensified diplomatic and trade relations with China, and we already have a representative office in that country. In this regard, we are promoting official visits between both countries at the diplomatic and business levels. In the future, I believe trade relations will increase and we aim to start exporting both goods and services to China. There are plenty of opportunities for both countries to develop commercial and industrial initiatives within the mining and energy sectors.</p><h4>Since the extractive industry is to play a key role in the development of the national economy, what is the significance of the Loma Miranda mining project?</h4><p>Mining is a very aggressive activity at the environmental level, and it sometimes generates controversy among social spheres. In this regard, the government plans to develop a proper environmental management and remediation plan for the Loma Miranda project. Once the plan is fully drafted, we will be able to start exploiting the resource, because we believe it is a very important mining project for the country. However, it is essential to implement responsible mining practices and we know that Xstrata Nickel Falcondo, the company that plans to develop the area, complies with the highest international standards in the nickel sector.</p><h4>Are there any plans to explore other potential mining areas in the country?</h4><p>At the moment, we are revising all of the mining concession contracts, because many of the country's mines are either out of use or they do not receive the appropriate investment. We will re-issue exploration and exploitation licenses, favoring companies able to better implement exploitation and operation activities. The Dominican Republic is a very rich country in terms of metals, and we believe there's a bright future ahead of us in the extracting industry.</p><h4>What are the Ministry's strategies for the development of the hydrocarbon sector?</h4><p>Hydrocarbons means the regulation of a fuels market on the one hand, and on the other hand, the exploration and exploitation of natural reserves, an area in which the future Energy and Mining Ministry will take over. Through the new ministry, we hope to improve exploration activities in the country in order to find reserves that enable us to exploit them at the commercial level, while also cutting down our dependence on the import of petroleum products. Right now, and thanks to an agreement with Venezuela's Petrocaribe, we are financing around 40% of the country's oil bill, which represents some 30,000 barrels a day out of the 146,000 that the country consumes daily. The country is very much affected by the fluctuations in oil prices, which has had a negative impact on us over the last couple of years. The electricity sector is among the most affected. The country's general subsidies for 2012 in the electricity sector will amount to $1.3 billion. This sector has had a structural deficiency for the past 50 years, and its development is one of the country's main challenges. We need to reduce generation costs, which would, at the same time, reduce distribution and purchasing costs as well.</p><h4>Is the Ministry considering any action to target losses in the electricity sector?</h4><p>Reducing generation costs, as well as investment plans from sector players and potential foreign investors, are vital measures to address the situation. However, it may take several years before we see any positive trend in this area. The government plans to build generation capacity to deal with inefficient generation in a sector burdened by the Madrid Agreement. Additionally, investment in the electricity distribution network is also very much needed.</p><h4>What are the country's future prospects for natural gas?</h4><p>The government of the Dominican Republic is promoting the construction of a new gas terminal in the country, something that requires high levels of investment from both the public and private spheres in order to encourage the participation of a second distributor in the country. Despite high prices at the international level, we will continue promoting gas as an alternative energy resource, while trying to strengthen the distribution network across the country.</p><h4>What new development will amendments to the Free Zones Act bring?</h4><p>Companies established in free zones are entitled to sell part of their production to the domestic market, and recently adopted amendments in the act approved a 2.5% tax on these companies' activities in the local market that would come to represent an income tax. Such a move aims to eradicate potential unfair competition. We believe that the EPZ scheme should be given continuity, because it currently generates 130,000 direct jobs and nearly $4 billion in exports.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the current state of the auto sector?<br></h4><p>The car business in the Dominican Republic has been up and down for the last five years. In 2007, new car sales reached above 30,000 units for the first time, but in 2008 and 2009, during the global financial crisis, sales went down sharply to less than 14,000. By 2010, sales started to grow again to a level of 20,000 units and again in 2011 went below that level. For 2012, we expect sales to grow slightly to about 21,000 units. As a country of 10 million people, the Dominican Republic is a promising market in terms of potential volume. However, the auto sector in this country has been suffering from a lack of growth, with sales still bellow the levels of 2007 mostly due to the lack of growth in the purchasing power of the economically active population. The situation at the moment is that the country has a large deficit. In order to combat the shortage in government-projected income against expenditure, a new tax reform was approved by the congress impacting the vehicle tax structure. Beside import duty, VAT is being increased from 16% to 18% in addition to the first license plate tax, which will be raised from 17% up to 20% depending on emission levels, plus a new annual transit fee of 1% based on the value of the vehicle, instead of a flat rate of less than $100. Since the purchasing power of the people that can afford to finance a vehicle will be reduced with the new taxes on the goods they purchase, it is expected that the market is going to slow down during 2013.</p><h4>How competitive is the Dominican Republic compared to other countries in the region?</h4><p>If you study the numbers of Guatemala, Costa Rica, and El Salvador, they have taxation levels similar to those of the Dominican Republic; however, our government is talking about raising taxes, meaning we are going to have the most expensive cars in the region. If that happens, we will lose our competitiveness and we are going to be in a difficult situation. A vehicle is not a luxury, but a necessity for the professional working class of the Dominican Republic, since a massive transportation system is not still available. The only relief for the Dominican Republic has been the Central America-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR), which creates a competitive advantage for vehicles made in the US. As a country culturally oriented to the US, the market embraced US-made vehicles like Ford at competitive prices.</p><h4>What models receive the most demand?</h4><p>The truth is that if money or financing was not an issue, most families owning two vehicles wouldn't rely on SUVs as they actually do. Today, approximately 45% of the vehicles that are sold in the country are SUVs, while less than 20% are sedans. People are concerned about potholes and the lack of a good drainage system in the streets during the rainy season. People buy SUVs not because they are snobbish, but because SUVs satisfy a practical need and people have the perception of feeling safer in them compared to other cars. In our case, our most popular models are the Ford Explorer, the Kia Sportage, and Sorento, as well as the Mazda CX-9.</p><div class="quote">“As a country of 10 million people, the Dominican Republic is a promising market in terms of potential volume."</div><h4>Why do Japanese brands, such as Mazda, have a wider acceptance among Dominican consumers and drivers?</h4><p>The Japanese brands were the first to tailor products oriented to emerging economies like the Dominican Republic. Within all those brands, Mazda stands out as maybe the only Japanese brand in the Dominican Republic that, in contrast with the others' options, didn't offer an entry-level brand or a luxury brand to the market, but instead a true premium brand experience at a non-premium price.</p><h4>How much has the Ford brand developed in the country?</h4><p>We have made Ford the number one US brand in the Dominican Republic, even including the volume of non-US made, US-branded vehicles being imported into the Dominican Republic. As the first brand to deliver a promise to customers by offering to drive quality, green, safe, and smart vehicles at CAFTA-DR prices, the market embraced the brand. This campaign boosted the brand's initial growth to above 400% and has been challenging the competitive vehicle market in the Dominican Republic since.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In line with the recent signs of an economic recovery in the Dominican Republic, how would you assess the current situation for the automotive industry?<br></h4><p>In the last two or three years, we have not been as badly hit by the economic crisis as other markets have. There has been a stable market and a stable exchange rate, which can be attributed to the former government. We see stability continuing for the next two or three years. The main concern for our sector is that the general conditions for the economy of the country are set for a low to modest expansion, so we expect that growth will stall a little. In the next two years, we expect to see a low but positive growth rate in our part of the industry. We do not foresee an explosion of demand in the next few years—only minimal fluctuation. The volume of used cars and equipment has a heavy influence on our business. A surplus in used cars and equipment in the Dominican Republic depresses growth in the market for new imports. Much of the future depends on the fiscal structure of import and consumer taxes. A reorganization of these items in connection with import costs, fuel consumption, and environmental protection would be healthy and positive.</p><h4>What are EDOM's brands and market position in its different divisions?</h4><p>Small- and mid-sized cars have not been the preferred option for Dominicans, as SUVs have constituted almost half of the imports in the past few years. In recent times, we have seen a steady change toward smaller and more efficient units, probably due to fuel costs and traffic conditions. Fiat, which has been known for its efficient, small, and powerful engines, has the potential to substantially improve its market share. We could have a higher market share in the commercial vehicle segment including natural-gas powered commercial units and trucks. In terms of luxury brands, we offer Alfa Romeo, which produces beautiful sports cars. Its models have been performing very well since we launched the brand in early 2012. On the tractor side, we represent high-quality brands like Case New Holland, which make up approximately 30% to 35% of the market. We also represent Iveco in the truck sector, and this brand is just starting to produce light trucks, which comprise most of this market segment. In the summer of 2012, we launched the light Iveco truck line, named Leoncino. In terms of big trucks, we have about a 3% or 4% market share, mainly composed of specialty units for big industries.</p><h4>Do you think you gain a competitive advantage from your affiliation with the large and consolidated Vicini Group?</h4><p>Yes, there is synergy in the group that is represented in so many sectors; Vicini is in the finance, insurance, energy, metallurgy, agriculture, and retail sectors. This opens up possibilities for us to work with each of these companies to promote our products. On the supplier side, we have Fiat, which is one of the most innovative groups in the world. Fiat has the best diesel engines, which are small and high performance. This means lower consumption and reduced emissions. We have four-cylinder engines that perform comparably with American six-cylinder engines. High-quality products create a competitive advantage for all of our brands, not only Fiat but also Alfa Romeo and Iveco.</p><div class="quote">“The volume of used cars and used equipment has a heavy influence on our business."</div><h4>EDOM also represents Hertz in the Dominican Republic. What is Hertz's local market position?</h4><p>In car rentals, there is brand association; there are top brands, mid-level brands, and economy brands. In the top brands, Hertz is number one in the world. Customers count on good service and the availability of many vehicles. On the service side, we try to be the top, even though we do not have the largest fleet. Our competitors may have more cars, but they provide a lower level of service. We prefer to have fewer cars and a higher level of service. We keep our cars fresh and in good shape, while some competitors have been using the same cars for over three years. This separates us from the competition.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>When did Ron Barceló become an international brand?<br></h4><p>Beica came to the Dominican Republic some 12 years ago. At that time, we were based in Spain, and thanks to our vast experience in the rum industry as a group of entrepreneurs, we reached an agreement with the Barceló family. Back then, we were present in five countries: Spain, Honduras, the US, Mexico, and the Dominican Republic, and we were exporting an average of 170,000 cases per year. To put these figures in context, the company today exports 1.7 million cases per year and we are active in 55 countries. The main markets are Spain, where we sell around 900,000 cases, and Chile, where we sell another 350,000 cases. The Dominican Republic represents a small percentage, but it is growing fast and we believe there is big future potential here, as well as in the US, Russia, and China.</p><h4>What type of agreement did you reach with the Barceló family?</h4><p>We set up a joint venture in order to expand the company at the international level, and we ended up buying the brand. In fact, the negotiations took between five and six years, and we did not purchase any facilities from the family, just the Barceló brand. In this regard, some members of the family stayed with us after the purchase, as well as the Garcí­a family, who were co-founders of the brand. A total of 92% of the company's capital belongs to two Spanish families, 5% belongs to Dominican families, and the rest is spread between minority shareholders such as staff.</p><h4>Why did you decide to externalize the marketing and distribution processes to Cervezerí­a Nacional for the local market?</h4><p>Our policy is to have either an importer or a distributor in each country where we export, and we believed it was also the right move in the Dominican Republic, which is a very complex market. There are over 50,000 selling points in the country and it requires a very large sales force. In this regard, the agreement with Cervezerí­a Nacional was very advantageous for us because the company holds vast experience and knowledge in the market. It has well-developed infrastructure, and its logistics network is large and very efficient. It also distributes other brands. The move has enabled us to compete in a better position in the local market.</p><h4>What percentage do local sales represent in your business activity?</h4><p>Sales in the country are around 400,000 cases. However, we have seen huge growth in the last few years. Three years ago, we were selling 100,000 cases. In this regard, our estimations are quite optimistic for the local market, and we expect to approach 1 million cases within three years. Our high-end products represent 70% of our sales in the Dominican Republic, and sales of our lower-end products are minimal. That gives us a privileged position in the market, because there is still plenty of room to grow in the latter area.</p><h4>How much did Beica invest in the current rum distillery and other facilities?</h4><p>When we purchased the Barceló brand, we did not obtain any of the facilities the family was using. In 2002, we developed our first production facility, Beica, which currently employs 150 people and produces 40,000 aging barrels in three different types of bottling. Recently, we built Ron Barceló Historical Center, a museum that aims to attract many of the visitors that come to the Dominican Republic. Since we had a few problems with the delivery of some alcohol we were buying from other companies, we invested in our own distillery along with Alcoholes Finos Dominicanos (AFD), a Venezuelan investor, and two sugarcane producers. It is the only distillery producing alcohol from sugarcane juice in the country. We also produce our own electricity from the remaining sugar cane. At the moment, we are developing a third facility in the San Francisco de Macorí­s free zone that will produce rum and manufacture bottles only for Spain. Overall, the company employs 400 people directly, and 2,000 indirectly, and the investment we have made in the country, along with our partners, totals around $70 million.</p><h4>What is your plan of action regarding exports to the US in alliance with the US-based Shaw-Ross?</h4><p>When exporting to the US, you need to have an import partner, which at the same time has to have a distributor in each state. Every state is completely unique in terms of tax- and alcohol-related laws. Recently, we signed an agreement with a sister company of Southern Wines, the largest distributor of alcohol beverages and wines in the US. We believe that in the next three to four years, the US market will become one of our main export markets with great growth rates.</p><h4>What is the aging period of Barceló Imperial Premium Blend and what are your current production figures for this rum?</h4><p>The aging period of this type of rum is between eight and 10 years, and we currently produce over 50,000 cases per year. However, we see the highest growth rate in Añejo rum, which varies from this one only in the aging period, which is between three and seven years. I would also like to say we do not tend to add the year to our bottles, because, among other things, if you compare the aging processes in the Dominican Republic and Scotland, you will see that it is much faster here due to weather conditions.</p><h4>How significant is it to be included on the Elite Brand list of International Wine and Spirit Research (IWSR) for the fourth year in a row?</h4><p>In order to be on such a privileged list, you have to comply with certain requirements. You must sell 1 million cases and export to more than 16 countries. Additionally, 40% of your sales must be exports. In this regard, we have complied with all these requirements for the last four years.</p><p>We started in 22nd place, and today we rank seventh. In addition, the Chicago Beverage Tasting Institute awarded us the “World's Best Rum" prize after scoring 97 out 100 points—the highest ever. Also, we are certified as producing “Authentic Caribbean Rum," and we possess other international certificates such as ISO 9001 and ISO 4000 related to security and environmental friendliness. We are constantly seeking to strengthen our international brand.</p><h4>How does Barceló compete with larger multinationals in the sector?</h4><p>We strongly believe in the need to invest in R&amp;D, as well as look for international partners who share the same passion and business philosophy. I would not say we are an aggressive company, but rather we invest in innovation at all levels, including products, packaging, and presentation.</p><h4>In your opinion, what regulatory steps should be taken to improve the sector?</h4><p>In my opinion, the sector does not need governmental help, but rather room to maneuver, as well as more legal and tax security that can be addressed through a long-term strategy for the industrial sector. Policies and national strategies should not change with the color of the government. Also, I believe that the country needs to update some of the key laws such as the Alcohol Act, which dates back to 1951.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role is the Central Bank of Ecuador (BCE) playing in the economic transformation of Ecuador?</h4><p>First of all, we have to mention that the BCE, as compared to its counterparts in other countries, is not an independent institution and we have chosen to play an economic development role as a central banking institution. According to the constitution of Ecuador, we are a financial institution responsible for the monetary, credit, and financial policies of our country. Overall, the BCE is solely responsible for managing the aggregate liquidity and the payment systems in the country, both public and private. In addition, we also manage the public central securities deposit, macroeconomic statistics, the regulatory framework of the finance sector, the administration of foreign exchange reserves, and the monitoring of public debt levels. Last but not least, the BCE also plays a very important role in expanding finance penetration rates and modernizing the payment systems in Ecuador.</p><h4>How is the BCE strategically tackling financial integration in Ecuadorean society?</h4><p>We are the main responsible institution for this ambitious strategy. However, we work closely with several other institutions to achieve our strategic goals. Basically, we are modernizing the tools for the promotion of this financial integration.</p><div class="quote">“The best example is that Ecuador avoided recession for the last few years despite low growth in developed countries."</div><h4>What is the BCE's interest rate strategy for the upcoming period?</h4><p>The BCE is the institution in charge of setting the maximum interest rate that can be paid, and we implemented a very ambitious strategy to lower these rates in 2009 and 2010. In this context, in 2010, we introduced some changes, for the BCE has to maintain rates at a reasonable level to keep the economy growing at a good pace, encourage the productive system, and ensure economic soundness for the country. It is important to note that in the last few years we have implemented several changes and reforms in the financial sector around rates and commissions, while keeping in mind the need to safeguard the development of the national economy. For example, we implemented the liquidity pool to make sure banks in Ecuador have a sufficient availability of financial resources, deposit guarantees, and stricter control of the inflow and outflow of dollars in the country. This is a much-needed measure for a dollarized economy like ours, which does not have its own currency, and in which consumers have traditionally opted to make savings deposits abroad. Ecuador today enjoys the highest liquidity levels in its history—around $15 billion, which is 15% to 16% above GDP. In addition, we repatriated a large amount of savings that Ecuador had abroad, and we are channeling it through public banking to fund the country's development.</p><h4>How would you assess the development of the trade balance in Ecuador over the next few years?</h4><p>The trade balance is the main structural challenge for Ecuador and we have to tackle it; the government of Ecuador has already stated its strategic goal to change the country's productive structure and that would enable the country to shift its trade flows. Measures adopted in recent years to tackle the country's dependency on the oil industry have enabled us to be in a better position today and say that the weight of oil in our economy has to be put into context. Its relative significance is decreasing thanks to, for example, the increase in tax incomes and other such incomes. The best example is that Ecuador avoided recession for the last few years despite low growth in developed countries and we closed 2012 with 5% growth, estimating that we will close 2013 with around 4% growth. We also know that the trade balance deficit in non-oil products is significant, and our main goal is to reverse this deficit trend. We started posting positive results from 2012. The main way to address this challenge is to change the productive structure of the country in the short to medium term; the government is committed to bringing in such changes and we are doing all that we can to contribute to this goal.</p><h4>How would you assess the business climate for foreign investors in Ecuador?</h4><p>Ecuador is a very attractive investment destination. Factors supporting this include stable interest tax management, robust growth, increasing purchasing power, the lowering of the unemployment rate, and a sound and stable economy. The regulatory and tax frameworks are very much favorable for the establishment of new investments. The government also introduced the Law on Regulation and Market Power, which is essential to attracting foreign investment. Ecuador is not a risky destination, and the most important thing is that we have a long-term vision. Over the last few years we have improved the quality and level of productive and logistics infrastructure across the country. In addition, the country is putting a lot of emphasis—more than any other regional country in terms of population—on capacitating its human capital through scholarships and the strengthening of the higher education sector, as well as the IT and research industries. We believe that these items are key in the transformation of the country and its economy. Finally, Ecuador has considerably reduced poverty levels and we have a bright future ahead, with the government leading the transformation from all points of view and encouraging the arrival of foreign investment into Ecuador. It is a rather small country that nevertheless aims very high, despite the challenges ahead. Ecuador is in a constant transformation and we are on the right path to achieve success.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[on-another-level]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role has the privatization of Turkey's defense sector had in helping to build the country into a leading defense products exporter?</h4><p>The Turkish defense sector is composed of institutions that can be gathered under two main categories. Turkish Armed Forces Foundation (TAFF) companies are the first group, which are the dominant actors realizing almost 40% of annual turnover. The other group is the privately owned and managed companies. TAFF companies operate as main contractors in the aerospace, rocket and missile, guns and ammunition, and defense electronics sectors. On the other hand, in naval and land systems, private companies undertake the main contracts. A close environment for collaboration has been established between these groups and they are mostly the solution partners for each other in defense programs. A level below the main contractors there are SME sub-contractors or suppliers, who we see as the most important and indispensable factors of industrial development. We aim to achieve a certain maturity level especially in terms of design and development skills in SMEs to strengthen the capacity and capabilities of these sub-contractors. Universities and the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TÜBİTAK) also play crucial roles, especially in constituting the technological background of the industry. There has been a significant evolutionary progress from the demand side. The direct procurement mechanism turned into co-production models throughout the 1990s. Policies in support of local industry have shown their efforts today in the form of local production projects and indigenous system integration capabilities. We owe this progress to a well-defined and applied industrial strategy accompanied by special privileges granted to local industry and research bodies. The outcome can be summarized as over $4 billion in turnover, 54% local content in defense procurement, and $1.2 billion in exports. Targets for 2016 are almost double the turnover and exports of 2012. We are aiming for a 70% local content percentage.</p><h4>What role can Turkey's defense exports play in helping to ease the current account deficit?</h4><p>Taking the latest figures into consideration, Turkey's total export figures are rising, notwithstanding the economic recession that still affects many countries in the world. According to the numbers that were stated by the Defense and Aerospace Industry Exporters' Association (SSI), $1.2 billion in exports were realized by our defense and aerospace industry. As this represents only 1% of total exports, this figure might be considered small. However, we are proud to say that from 2011 to 2012, defense and aviation exports climbed 42%. This number can never be undervalued as it indicates one of the highest jumps among the sectors constituting total exports. When we have a closer look at our export figures, Ankara increased its exports the most—by 10.5%—to reach a total of $6.5 billion. Of this figure, $531 million was accounted for by the aerospace and defense sectors.While the average value per ton of Turkey's exports is $1,600, the same value for Ankara is $23,500. This is because most of our major defense industry manufacturers are in Ankara. Those manufacturers create job opportunities for the supply industry and SMEs. Defense industry manufacturing is based on a high level of capital and technology and, eventually, it will definitely create a high level of value-added. As defense systems are composed of many complex sub-systems, they require the involvement of many professional sub-contractors. This is the reason why the defense industry was underlined as a strategic locomotive sector as part of Vision 2023. One more aspect to consider regarding the current account deficit is defense expenditure. Recently, local producers have taken a larger role in the provision of modern equipment for the Turkish Armed Forces. This figure was 45% in 2009, 52% in 2010, and, finally, 54% in 2011. We are capable of meeting more than half of our own needs through national industry. Through the offset programs that we are implementing, companies have been undertaking offset commitments valued at billions of dollars. Those programs enable us to minimize the outflow of resources.</p><div class="quote">“Turkish defense industry products have reached a level where they can compete with other products."</div><h4>What steps is the government taking to promote the Turkish defense industry abroad?</h4><p>Turkish defense industry products have reached a level where they can compete with other products. We have thus started to work on deciding the necessary steps to be taken to promote our industry. The Undersecretariat for Defense Industries (SSM) prepared and published strategic plans for the 2007-2011 and 2012-2016 periods, covering not only institutional but also industrial strategies. We have developed close relations with other related governmental institutions and foreign counterparts to follow developments and coordinate our efforts. In order to realize this objective, we have already officially opened defense offices in three countries to begin with, including the US, Saudi Arabia, and Brussels, Belgium, the home of NATO. Furthermore, we are working on opening more Defense Cooperation Offices to directly coordinate our cooperation activities in different regions. Realizing the necessity to establish an organization to unite the companies in the sector, the SSI was established in 2011, with the full support and coordination of the Ministry of Economy and SSM. The SSI successfully organized a conference at the end of 2012, during which defense industry representatives and related governmental officials all came together to discuss and decide the necessary steps to promote the defense sector.</p><h4>Turkey now has plans for an increasing number of indigenously developed defense projects, including a jet fighter, a helicopter, and a tank. Why are these plans significant for the long-term development of Turkey's defense sector?</h4><p>The TX/FX program, involving fighter and training jets, is now at the conceptual design stage. The program focuses on utilizing domestic capabilities in the design and production of these products, which are planned to replace the Turkish Armed Forces' existing T-38 trainers and F-16 fighters from the 2020s. In terms of helicopter programs, we are aiming for the local design, development, and production of civil-certified light utility/training helicopters. Acquiring the complete know-how for tank design, development, system integration, production, testing, qualification, and modification is also a major part of the ALTAY Main Battle Tank program. Every effort that has been made will come to light in the form of indigenous platforms that are equipped with locally developed sub-systems that primarily meet the Turkish Armed Forces' and our international allies' requirements.</p><h4>How would you characterize the importance of international partnerships, such as the F-35 joint-strike fighter (JSF), for Turkey's defense sector?</h4><p>Two international development projects have been carried out under SSM's responsibility for more than 10 years. One of them is the Airbus A400M and the other one is JSF. The F-35 JSF is one of the programs in which we can underline the importance of international partnerships. Being a part and taking an active role in the JSF's international environment with allied countries around the world brings many advantages. Turkey became one of the program's partners beginning from the concept development phase (CDP) and found a chance to be involved in the management of the program. We are able to reach and share knowledge and information among other partners and actively manage Turkey's requirements. The JSF also opens the collaboration environment among partners. Turkey benefits from the opportunities of this environment. As the biggest international defense project, Turkish defense companies also benefit from a large spectrum of business opportunities, improve their capabilities to a sufficient level to serve the fifth-generation fighter's requirements, and are now taking their place as very important players in the global supply chain. International partnerships add great value to Turkey, both in terms of program management and industrial participation aspects.</p><h4>What role will Teknopark İstanbul play in promoting R&amp;D?</h4><p>Istanbul is one of the biggest cities in the world, with a population of 15 million. Recent data shows that with a GDP of about $133 billion, Istanbul's domestic income through its industrial and traditional services is higher than many EU countries, including Romania, Croatia, Ukraine, and Luxemburg. Also, it has a unique and exciting location and it has been chosen as the Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) headquarters for more than 1,000 multinational companies to manage tens of neighboring countries' operations. Istanbul has 40-plus internationally acclaimed universities providing excellent technology-based training. In light of all these considerations, we can say that Istanbul is undoubtedly a city full of opportunities. This is why we are creating one of Europe's biggest and most eminent science parks here. Though Teknopark İstanbul is not solely a defense industry-focused science park, it also aims to bring an extensive industrial and technological defense industry, which is mainly located in Ankara right now, to Istanbul.</p><h4>What are the government's priorities for the Turkish defense sector over the medium term?</h4><p>The government's priorities for the defense sector over the medium term are mainly sustainability and the development of technological competence. We will concentrate on various measures to support the efforts of local industry. A more effective suppliers industry is aimed at satisfying the main contractors' needs. A more active role for the private sector will also be promoted, as will measures to increase exports. At the same time, a more systematized technology development process will be pursued. Test and certification infrastructure will be strengthened. The focal point of the strategy is on the development of indigenous platforms and systems projects.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of the Qatar National Research Fund (QNRF), and what was the strategy behind its establishment?</h4><p>QNRF was established back in 2006 as the enabling arm for research within the Qatar Foundation. Since then, there has been a paradigm shift at educational institutions in the country. Qatar University, which used to pride itself on being an educational institution, now considers itself both a research and an educational institution. Research is also taking hold in the health sector; the logo of Hamad Medical Center says, “health, education, and research." This is thrilling for us because people are now recognizing the role of research in the development of the country. This also reflects the vision of HH Sheikha Moza bint Nasser, the Chairperson of Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development. All of this is based on the realization of transforming Qatar's economy from being a resource-based economy to a knowledge-based economy, for which research is a very important pillar of the Qatar National Vision 2030. Without the research component, you cannot transform the country and diversify the economy. Another important aspect is that QNRF has taken the research culture down to its roots, and we have started introducing research programs to high school students and undergraduates, all the way up to the world-renowned scientists. We have tried to cover the full spectrum.</p><h4>What are some recent success stories of the projects that QNRF is currently funding, and what implications do they have on a wider scale?</h4><p>From my perspective, all the grants are success stories. So far, QNRF has committed over $500 million in grants, at all levels. Every researcher or key investigator who received a grant from us has worked very hard and they earn their grants on a competitive basis—only one out of five applicants receives a grant—so, from a global perspective, they are all success stories for us. What makes QNRF unique in the region—and maybe the world—is that we are open to collaboration internationally, meaning we do not limit our grants to inside Qatar; we open the door to applicants from outside the country, creating an excellent collaborative atmosphere and environment for research. In the beginning, more than 50% of applicants came from outside Qatar, because we had the opportunity to provide funding, and researchers are thirsty for funding opportunities; therefore, they took advantage and applied. However, we also placed conditions on the external applications, and firstly not more than 35% of the grant can be used outside of the country. They have to find a cooperating team inside Qatar, which is very important because it is win-win. We also made sure that a minimum of 50% of the funded research, measured in man-hours, should be expended inside Qatar. Most of our success stories involve international collaboration. One of our funded projects involves researchers from the Juva Truffle Center in Finland, which is working to increase the yield of desert truffles in Qatar. These are top-notch scientists receiving grants of up to $1 million. However, we cover the full spectrum of research, from high school and undergraduate students and so on. Some of the undergraduate research also resulted in some interesting stories. We are not only funding science, we cover a vast array of topics and research, from arts and humanities to ICT, healthcare, education, and economics. One of the awards was awarded to a researcher at Weill Cornell Medical College related to genealogical studies. They identified the date palm gene, and the genome from the palm, as well as identifying the gene that is responsible for the gender of the palm. What does that mean? It means that one can now know the gender of the palm when it is being planted, so instead of having a 50% chance of yielding fruit, and not knowing for five or six years if it is male or female, one can know immediately, and so the results of this research have huge commercial applications.</p><div class="quote">“Without the research component, you cannot transform the country and diversify the economy."</div><h4>To what extent do women play a role in the research that you fund?</h4><p>Women are already empowered here. In Qatar, they now represent more than two-thirds of the student population. QNRF's Undergraduate Research Experience Program (UREP) supports young women in Qatari society in particular to develop their skills in science and research. The most recently concluded 13th cycle of UREP had 44 women participants amongst the 68 Qatari students who were awarded. We are investing heavily to promote the participation of women in science and research to help develop and encourage a new generation of well-established female researchers.</p><h4>What evaluations do you carry out to ensure that all sectors in Qatar are explored in terms of R&amp;D?</h4><p>A huge effort that was undertaken in 2012 culminated in the release of a very important document: the Qatar National Research Strategy (QNRS). Simply put, this strategy states that Qatar should concentrate on four pillars: energy and environment, healthcare, computer sciences and ICT, and social sciences, humanities, and the arts. For these pillars, we now have national institutes: the Qatar Environment &amp; Energy Research Institute (QEERI), the Qatar Biomedical Research Institute (QBRI), and the Qatar Computing Research Institute (QCRI). For each of these pillars, we identified the most compelling challenges for the country. Through QEERI, we looked at how to enhance oil recovery, which is very important because revenues in the country are predominantly generated by the petrochemical sector. We also have environmental challenges, because of Qatar's high carbon dioxide footprint. This is because it is a small country with a large petrochemical industry. New ideas involve reusing carbon dioxide as well as fluids for enhancing oil recovery, which are being developed and used in some of the depleted oil fields. In regard to the health pillar, we have a major challenge both here and in the Gulf region, where there is a high prevalence of diabetes and cardiovascular disease, as well as some forms of cancer. The same goes for the ICT pillar; IT is an ongoing source of development.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Oman Arab Bank (OAB) developed in recent years?</h4><p>OAB has grown steadily over the years and we now have 62 branches with over 1,000 employees. Due to our prudent approach we have always generated profits for our shareholders. OAB began operations with $6 million in capital and now has $116 million. We have focused on corporate banking and financing industrial projects. We have been involved in financing for roads, hospitals, and schools, as well as many infrastructure projects, and we finance directly through contractors. Most of the roads in Oman today were financed by OAB. We do not finance the government, but always the contractor. We have heavily invested in Sohar Port, where we are financing projects worth over $600 million in total. We are now opening a branch in the industrial zone. We also financed all the companies that are working in Duqm and we were the first bank to open a branch there. OAB has given loans to the Duqm project totaling over $150 million. We continue to finance both projects. Our role is to concentrate on such businesses. Personal loans and retail banking are a part of the bank's product portfolio, and we are gradually building this line of business. We are also increasing our activity in the project finance sector. Our focus is always to finance projects and trade. Investment Management Group (IMG), which is the comprehensive investment banking arm of the bank, manages an investment portfolio worth more than $650 million. IMG group is very active in local and regional equity markets.</p><h4>What is your strategy for sourcing new project finance contracts?</h4><p>We monitor all contracts being tendered constantly. We go to the Tender Board for the list of all projects and then we contact contractors in order to bid to arrange financing facilities. This ensures that we will arrange the financing facilities, irrespective of which contractor wins the contract. This is imperative because we do not know who the winner will be, but we have to make the contract, even if they are foreign companies. We are very active and utilize Arab Bank branches in foreign countries to contact the headquarters of those companies looking to invest here.</p><div class="quote">“We are one of the few banks nominated by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to finance SMEs."</div><h4>What products and services do you offer SMEs?</h4><p>We are one of the few banks nominated by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to finance SMEs, with the government securing 50% and the banks taking 50% of the responsibility. We are very active in this field and finance many companies. We now also arrange seminars for small business owners to educate them about financing, managing their projects, and how to run a successful business. Participants receive a certificate of completion. There is a need to participate, to educate the people on how to operate businesses, how to manage, how to prepare a balance sheet, and how to analyze their business financially. This is crucial in order to give the banks enough confidence to loan them money. You have to prove to the bank that you are capable of managing your project, and these seminars will go a long way to help SMEs owners gain access to credit. I have advised the Ministry of Industry and Commerce that the only way to prevent SMEs from failing was to educate them about business.</p><h4>How would you evaluate your personal lending strategy?</h4><p>We are still conservative, but we are facilitating loans because the competition is very intense. The competition between the banks should be on service, not on reduced security. Reducing security will be a disaster for the banks in the end. When competition levels become too high, banks lose the fundamental rules of banking to access business. We find that all the banks are offering very low rates, without security sometimes. We are facing tough competition. OAB has to adapt with the market, but only to a certain extent. In the end, the strength of a bank is its portfolio; if your portfolio is weak, you are a weak bank and your rating will fall as you increase your provisions for bad loans. My expectation is that bad loans will increase in the future if banks continue in this way. Currently, the effects have not reached the surface, but in two or three years they will surface and their ratings will suffer.</p><h4>How important is e-banking for OAB?</h4><p>We concentrate and spend a great deal of money on e-banking. We were the first bank to issue the Smart Card, which is an internal system—not linked to Visa or other major companies—and it was very successful. We started issuing them in 2000, and for the 13 years we have been using it there have been no errors. Nobody can force or misuse this card since it can only be used for the purpose for which it was issued. It is a pre-paid card, but it is very secure and very comfortable. We have collected billions of rials through this. Eventually, the government will have its own internal system using our technology. If anyone pays by Visa, the money takes three days for approval to be given from a different country. With the Smart Card, the money is transferred instantaneously because it is not waiting for approval.</p><h4>What are you expectations for Islamic finance, and how will OAB benefit from its international affiliations with existing Islamic finance institutions?</h4><p>The difficulty here is that there is no background to the Islamic function in Omani banking. Educationally, people do not understand Islamic finance. But for now, people want to test it, they want to know how the services work and what are the costs. If they feel that the costs are much higher than the commercial banks, they will not continue, but maybe in the beginning they will go and try these new banks. The hope is that when people understand the procedures, the banks will be able to increase their customer base, but it depends on the management and services, and I think it is very important to educate customers. The window we have opened is like any other Islamic bank. Arab Bank group has an Islamic bank in Jordan and we benefit from its experience. It sends us people to help us to establish the systems, management and the responsibility, and we are forming an advisory board for the functioning of Islamic banking.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the first government sovereign sukuk issuance?</h4><p>The government is prudent and is studying this matter. It tried to avoid getting involved in Islamic finance and not to interfere, but this is not possible because of the duties of the Central Bank. The government must be involved to an extent, observing, auditing and regulating, but in general, it would prefer not to work with Islamic financing. It is not planning to issue sukuk; maybe the banks will create this product for their customers, but not the government.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the banking sector in the medium term?</h4><p>I think that because the government is financially comfortable here and extremely capable of spending money on projects, everyone is working. And since oil prices are good, we are making reserves; therefore, there is no problem. The challenge is if the government faces difficulty in financing the projects it announces. If you have a project and a contractor, a company, the bank, and the merchant are all working, then all the sectors are happy. However, if spending falls, everyone loses, including the bank. And therefore the banks are doing well until now, and with political and economic stability the future looks steady and promising. We are very confident in the ability and wisdom of the government.</p><h4>What is your vision for the future of OAB?</h4><p>We make progress every year. We have a strong team to face the competition and we have to persist with our activities to gain the majority of projects that are being tendered by strengthening our team and organizing ourselves to compete with other banks. Our competitors are very aggressive, and we have never faced such aggressive activity before. However, we are fine, we are optimistic, our background is strong, our base is solid, and we are supported by our affiliate Arab Bank.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the Port of Duqm Company (PDC) structured?</h4><p>For the Port of Duqm, as with most of the big projects in Oman, the government decided to team up with an established player in the industry with a proven track record. A similar approach was made for the Port of Sohar, for which the Port of Rotterdam, in the Netherlands, was selected and for the Port of Salalah, APMT, with its HQ in the Netherlands, is participating. The Port of Antwerp, in Belgium, was invited by the Omani government to participate in the management of the Port of Duqm. Duqm has the additional advantage of being a special economic zone (SEZ), with its own independent body called the Special Economic Zone Authority of Duqm (SEZAD). This Authority regulates the complete economic zone of Duqm and acts independently in issuing commercial and environmental permits. SEZAD communicates directly with the concerned ministries in Muscat and acts as a single window for its internal stakeholders. It creates a more direct problem-solving mechanism, which is favorable for business. There are, of course, other attractive aspects to the zone, as there are unique regulations regarding imports and exports, and it is possible to do business here as a 100% foreign-owned company. The umbrella of SEZAD covers all projects in the area, and the Port of Duqm is a key project in this economic zone next to the industrial zone, airport, and tourism development projects. Today, a lot of our efforts go toward assisting the design, where we cooperate with the design team and contractors appointed by the involved ministry. We strive for the most up-to-date technology and design for the port.</p><h4>How important is it that the Duqm project was started from scratch?</h4><p>I think it is a key aspect for future success. From the start you can put the right direction forward. For example, the marine works have been designed and executed to accommodate the largest vessels up to a draft of 18 meters. Also, both dry docks are some of the biggest in the region and are more than 400 meters long. The total port boundary is 170 square kilometers and the area for logistics covers 1,550 hectares. Each time we make a decision we have to keep one eye on the requirements of the future. We want to make the port as modern as possible, and the fact that we started from scratch has allowed us to anticipate future needs. Because of this, the long lifespan of our port will be guaranteed.</p><div class="quote">“Our main focus today is on the oil and gas fields in the center of Oman, which are very close to the Port of Duqm."</div><h4>Is the building of the infrastructure your responsibility?</h4><p>No, we are an end user. We will receive the assets when everything is finished. Until completion, everything is under the control of the Ministry of Transport and Communication (MOTC) and SEZAD. They do the project management and the financial follow up. The PDC, as an end user, gives the required operational feedback so the design and construction will be perfect for later use.</p><h4>To what extent will you be involved in the operations in the port when it is complete?</h4><p>Our approach is the “landlord" model, similar to the models used in the ports of Antwerp and Rotterdam and what was used to create the Port of Sohar here in Oman. This model is based on the principle that the different terminals are operated by dedicated companies that are experts in their fields of operations, whether it is general cargo, dry-bulk, liquids, or containers. The port authority takes care of the maritime access and services needed by the shipping lines calling at the port (waterside services) and managing the terminal concessions (landside services). If the port authority is also engaged in operating the different terminals inside the port, then this can become an issue in a bigger port as Duqm will be, as there is no competition available. The shipping lines have no alternative and can only choose the port authority to serve them. Then there is no incentive to improve service levels and the port will not function optimally. Ideally, we would like to see competition inside the port accommodating different terminal operators.</p><h4>How will the port complement the existing maritime facilities in Oman?</h4><p>Our main focus today is on the oil and gas fields in the center of Oman, which are very close to the Port of Duqm. A lot of new projects are going on there and all of them need big equipment to come in. These dedicated project cargoes are mostly oversized parcels that are difficult to bring in by the other ports of Oman because of height restrictions and longer road connections. Duqm is ideal to act as the port of entry for these project cargoes. This first step—we call it Early Operations—has started and is generating the first business in the Duqm area, and this is happening even before works on pavements, roads, technical buildings, and fencing have been finished. The second stage will focus on the development of industrial activities in Duqm. These activities will focus on the downstream of the oil refinery coming to the area and the processing of the available minerals in the region. This requires terminals inside the port that are handling dry-bulk, liquids, and general cargo, including container handling. Today, the design and tendering process for these contractor works is in progress. The Early Operations on the port are already creating jobs in the area.</p><h4>How important will the refinery be when it comes online in 2017?</h4><p>It will be crucial as the refinery will create business for the port. On the one hand, the import and export of petroleum products will create traffic for the port. On the other hand, it will create on the land side the possibility for downstream industries utilizing the products coming out of the refinery and manufacturing different kinds of plastic pellets that will then attract companies that are extruding these pellets into finished products for car parts and household items.</p><h4>When do you expect the port to be running at full capacity?</h4><p>A port is never finished. If you look at the Port of Antwerp, it has been developing for 500 years, dock-by-dock, step-by-step. It is still growing and upgrading its infrastructure for present and future requirements. Out of the first package, the marine works that include both breakwaters, dredging the approach channel, the first port basin, and the construction of the commercial quay walls have been finished. Parallel to these works, both dry docks have been built and are now operated by the Oman Drydock Company (ODC). The roads of this first package are now being constructed. The packages that take care of the pavement on the commercial quay wall, the technical buildings, and the entrance gate complex with its fencing are now under design. Once they are constructed, the commercial quay, which is 2.4-kilometers long, will accommodate a general cargo terminal, two container terminals, and one dry-bulk terminal. The construction should be finished in 2016. To accommodate the in- and out-flows of the refinery coming to Duqm, the development of liquids jetties, which will be on the other side of the port, has to be carried out. This package has to come into operation by 2017. As you see, it will be a never-ending story.</p><h4>What opportunities does Duqm represent to open new markets and shipping routes?</h4><p>Oman is at the crossroads of Europe and Asia. It is well situated for trade from India, Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. We hope that the construction of  Duqm Port will lead to the establishment of local Omani companies operating some terminals, perhaps expanding to another port in the country and then, maybe, going international and operating a terminal elsewhere in the Gulf. It is a step-by-step process. History shows us that Oman has clearly played an important role in international trade, from Zanzibar to the Gulf. The logic is that once Duqm's infrastructure is in place, it can play a part in this international trade. Oman's two largest ports, Sohar and Salalah, are proof that it will be a success. The location of Oman is our best asset.</p><p>Corrections were made to this article on the afternoon of April 22, following a version that was sent to subscribers on the morning of the same day.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange (ADX) General Index recently rallied to its highest level in more than three years. What is spurring market confidence amidst so much global uncertainty?</h4><p>In terms of performance, the ADX is up by almost 18.5% as of April 14, 2013, making it the fifth best performing market globally. In 2012, the ADX was up by 9%—there is a constant growth pattern here. We have noticed liquidity returning, and the activity picked up after ADX-listed companies reported good financial results in 2012. Based on a report by Al Fajr Securities, the total aggregate profits for local companies are valued at AED41.8 billion, which is up by 25.8% in comparison to 2011. The cash dividends issued in 2013 were valued at AED15 billion, which is 14% more than the previous year. ADX's share of the total cash dividend distributed by companies listed on the UAE stock markets is 64%. Indeed, Abu Dhabi's economy is expected to grow further. The IMF growth prediction is 3.1%, whereas the expectation for Abu Dhabi is 5.7%.</p><h4>How can the ADX become more reflective of the economy in Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>The economy of Abu Dhabi is expected to grow by 5.7%. It is clear that the non-oil sector is playing a bigger role than before, but the key driver is still the petrochemicals sector. However, there are no petrochemical companies listed on the ADX, meaning the main driver of the economy is not present on the exchange yet. There are also many other important sectors that are performing well but are not represented on the ADX, like education and healthcare. This means that the performance of the ADX does not reflect the real performance of the economy of Abu Dhabi. In addition, many other large companies operating in Abu Dhabi are not listed on the exchange because they are either private or family-owned companies.</p><div class="quote">“The ADX is up by almost 18.5% as of April 14, 2013, making it the fifth best performing market globally."</div><h4>What makes ADX attractive to the domestic companies that are listed?</h4><p>It is a great advantage to be a part of a strong economy with a clear strategy as is the case with ADX and our close affiliation with the government through Vision 2030. One other advantage is being a full member of the World Federation of Exchanges (WFE). Actually, we are the youngest stock market to be awarded this honor since the inception of the organization. These factors represent an attractive opportunity for companies to be listed on the ADX. We are working very hard to promote Abu Dhabi, its agenda, its companies, and its vision. We encourage companies to channel themselves through this vision—that is to market themselves, be promoted, go abroad, and show off their products. We believe the liquidity is there and has always been available. It is simply a matter of time, it is a matter of building more confidence, and it is a matter of working harder to attract existing liquidity—especially institutional liquidity. If the companies were to take on such tasks, the result would be that the value of their shares would go up, and that is what companies want.</p><h4>What is the ADX doing to attract international investors to the exchange?</h4><p>We work closely with the relevant authorities on the matter of rules and regulations. We coordinate and cooperate to issue sets of rules and regulations that will further benefit the financial market in the UAE. These regulations make the lives of domestic and international investors easier, happier, and more secure. We are also working internally to continue to develop our infrastructure. For example, we are working on the enhancement of our delivery versus payment (DVP) model. We believe these moves will create an environment that will be familiar to international investors. And, of course, being recognized by the WFE is of great importance since it is one of the checks international investors make. Also, in our endeavor to attract investment, we have been holding road shows since 2004, where we showcase the opportunities of our listed companies and of Abu Dhabi to investors in those parts of the world. We have held road shows in Europe, the US, as well as the Far East in Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan, and South Korea.</p><h4>In 2010, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) were introduced to the ADX. How has this been received by investors?</h4><p>We were the first exchange in the Middle East to list ETFs. This is the positive side. On the other hand, we believe that investors still don't fully understand what ETF means. As a result, they were not attracted to ETFs. Yet, ETF performance in 2012 was actually much better than most stocks traded on the exchange, but investors are still not sure what ETFs are. We, therefore, need to carry out awareness programs for the different types of investing that the exchange currently offers. We also need to develop better relationships with other exchanges and create opportunities by issuing different types of indices. We have plans to introduce new ETFs to the exchange, which would create more diverse investment opportunities.</p><h4>What opportunities are you seeing in the growth of the sukuk market?</h4><p>In 2012, the GCC was very active in terms of issuing sukuk bonds. It was a record number—and 54% of the issued sukuk bonds were from the UAE. Nevertheless, if you go to the market here, we only carry one convertible bond. Alternatively, we perceive big opportunities for having bonds and sukuks listed on the ADX. The opportunity will not come immediately given that bonds and sukuks are continually traded over the counter (OTC). This is the prospect we are looking at and we are working with the relevant authorities to achieve. We have already put the legal framework together and developed the internal set up.</p><h4>What are some of the steps the ADX has taken recently to attract long-term institutional investors?</h4><p>In principal, institutional investor operatives are asset managers. It is for that reason that ADX holds periodical meetings with assets managers domestically and internationally. In those meetings, we try to encourage asset managers to play a stronger role in the financial advancement of their clients by introducing them to the investment opportunities that the ADX has to offer. Also, we try to advise our individual investors toward the rational choice of investing by introducing them to fund managers. When fund managers buy and sell it is based on analyzing the market, charts, and history.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How can Ecuador realize its mining potential over the medium term?</h4><p>Traditionally, Ecuador has focused on exploiting the oil industry. Five years ago, we also prioritized the development of such strategic sectors as mining, boosted by high mineral prices around the world and investors that looked at Ecuador as a key investment destination within the mining industry. We see the mining sector as a key industry to change the energy matrix of the country and further create a competitive economy in Ecuador at the international level. Today, the mining industry still plays a minor role in the country's economy—2.5% of GDP as compared to 14% for the oil industry—and that is why we have yet to fully exploit the potential of the mining sector, which is still focused on the small scale. Due to the high prices of minerals in international markets, and the increasing interest in investing in the Ecuadorean mining sector, we currently have five ongoing strategic projects that we believe can give the sector the push it needs and develop rural areas of our country. In addition, we have an additional 20 junior projects that are small to medium scale in size that require high levels of investment to exploit their reserves. The government is to update the mining regulatory framework to facilitate the development of these projects, and we expect to see results in the short to medium term. Right now, the sector is structured according to a technical categorization; artisanal mining, mines with production limits, and large-scale mines. We are in the process of adding a new category, medium-scale projects, which is the key element to boost productive activity in the sector, and give more room to development and production to the small-scale mines. Small- and medium-scale mining projects don't need a 25-year contract and can start producing immediately. A better categorization, which will be accompanied by clearer rules of the game, will be beneficial to the development of the entire sector, from small-scale projects to the largest ones.</p><h4>What roles does the National Mining Company (ENAMI) play in the development of the mining sector?</h4><p>Constitutionally, natural resources are preferably exploited by the government through either public companies or the so-called mixed economy. Ecuador is still in the first stages of development of the mining industry, and we believe that it is not the best option for a public company to get involved in projects that require large amounts of capital with high risk levels. In this context, we set up ENAMI some two to three years ago. Today, this company already has an attractive exploration and operating portfolio, and when it comes to large-scale projects, its main priority is to seek partnerships at the international level. In future, we see ENAMI as an institution capable of handling and operating large-scale projects.</p><div class="quote">“Ecuador welcomes international companies to come to our country to invest in the oil industry."</div><h4>What are the main ongoing projects regarding oil refining for the short to medium term in Ecuador?</h4><p>Ecuador has three oil refineries; two very small, old and outdated plants, and one medium-sized refinery. They have an overall processing capacity of 175,000 barrels at the moment. The level of technology in these plants is rather low and the output of these refineries does not suit the country's current needs. In addition, Ecuador imports oil-related goods worth $4 billion, which posses a high risk to our economy. For these reasons, President Correa decided to develop a new project, the Pacific Refinery, to change this situation and become an exporting economy in terms of oil-related products. We have completed the engineering works after redesigning the project. We envisaged a refinery plant with an initial processing capacity of 200,000 barrels to be expanded to 300,000 barrels in the second phase. Right now, we are holding talks with several companies to secure the financial resources to develop the project, and we expect to close a deal very soon with the Chinese company CNPC, which would enter the project as a partner and stakeholder owning 30% of the company; 51% would belong to Petroecuador, and the remaining 19% to Pedevesa. We hope to close a funding agreement with Industrial and Commercial Bank of China based on 70% financing and 30% equity.</p><h4>What does Ecuador need to maximize its potential in non-renewable natural resources?</h4><p>We need to launch more extensive and in-depth exploration and exploitation campaigns in both the oil and mining sectors. In the case of the latter, I think the key would be to conduct geological reports and studies across the country, which would give as a better picture of the country's future potential in the field. In terms of oil exploration, I think there is room to expand activities in the country without entering territory within the national parks of Ecuador. The new tender process is vital for the future of the industry. In this context, we have a clear strategy to diversify financial resources for the industry in order to attract more foreign investment and combine it with public capital. We also need to apply the highest international standards and technologies in these two strategic sectors through international partnerships and agreements. In addition, we increasingly promote the use of clean energies to produce electricity as well as in other productive activities in the energy sector.</p><h4>What role can the Gulf of Guayaquil play to attract more investment?</h4><p>We already have several companies conducting exploration works in the area, and we believe that in the near future we will see further developments in terms of production. I think Petroecuador could soon look for potential partners to carry out both exploration and exploitation activities. In this context, we have a proposal from Gazprom to come to Ecuador to develop exploration activities in the gas industry, and we will also tender some areas of the Gulf of Guayaquil very soon.</p><h4>What is your general outlook for the oil industry in Ecuador for the short to medium term?</h4><p>The new tendering process will bring new contracting models under tariff structures. Although we know the first round could be the hardest one, around 50% of the area already has exploration proposals. I believe that in three to four tendering rounds, we could cover the entire area. Such contract models have already been applied in countries like Iraq, Angola, and Mexico. In this context, cooperation and technological transfer between the public and private sectors are key to further boost activity in the sector. For example, recovering techniques must be improved through new and more advanced technology and methods. In addition, by boosting capital investment, we will be able to improve production and recovery figures. We think we can double production figures and the proven reserves in the country. Ecuador welcomes international companies to come to our country to invest in the oil industry.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us more about the search for new investors for Cape Verde's $300 million airport refurbishment?</h4><p>In Cape Verde, there are four airports, two of which are for tourism. The question is how to better utilize one of our international airports to connect Africa, Europe, and America. We're talking about the premier airport in the country and the largest. We want to transform the airport into a large center of aviation; a hub. It's a project for which we are in the process of finding investors.</p><h4>Why is Cape Verde an attractive destination for tourists?</h4><p>At the moment, tourism is the principal economic activity of the country. First of all, the country is composed of islands located 500 kilometers from Senegal. We have beautiful beaches and an agreeable climate for tourists who visit at all times of the year. Therefore, it's the climate, the nature, the beaches, and the diversity of the islands that are very interesting for tourists. Secondly, we are a very secure country for investors. We have created guarantees for foreign investors and fostered a safe climate. Everything is guaranteed for investors who want to do business here. From a political point of view, we are stable and secure. Our country and climate are good for your health, and we offer a unique experience for our tourists. Cape Verde has been independent for 38 years. We also have a strong education system for students. We have acquired very important social developments and made advancements in education. Around 85%-100% of our children are enrolled in school. The level of our education, the investment guarantees, and the business climate, as well as the favorable ambiance for tourists are all benefits that our country offers.</p><div class="quote">“Cape Verde, like Dubai, is in a strategic position to contribute to development in our region."</div><h4>How is Cape Verde different from other West African countries?</h4><p>We are islands, we're an insulated territory, and we have a huge mix of cultures. People live in harmony and we are open to foreign visitors.</p><h4>How many tourists visit each year?</h4><p>Up to 500.000 people visit per year, but we will start within 10 to 15 years to progressively and slowly develop to a level that is sustainable. At the moment, there is huge interest in investing in the tourism industry.</p><h4>What there other economic sectors in Cape Verde that are interesting at the moment?</h4><p>The country is in the process of developing a number of plans to transform the port. The service sector is developing, as is the fishing industry. We also have a growing energy sector. The government is interested in developing renewable energy sources because the country has a lot of sun and a lot of wind. We have the conditions to develop new, green energy resources.</p><h4>When will work on the airport refurbishment begin?</h4><p>The investors are in the process of finding partners at the moment, and civil aviation and commercial activities will soon begin. Right now, we are presenting the project to investors and finding partners.</p><h4>What can Cape Verde learn from Dubai as it develops into a regional hub?</h4><p>Dubai offers an extraordinary experience. Here, I believe Cape Verdeans have a lot to learn. In my opinion, Cape Verde, like Dubai, is in a strategic position to contribute to development in our region. It's necessary to see what one can do, and if it is even possible. The country is growing well and it is in a good location. Therefore, the government makes good profits off of its strategic position in this zone. My opinion is that in the near future Africa will be stronger. So, it is crucial that the world sees Africa from another angle. The continent is in the process of leaving many difficulties behind. There has been much progress, and there are many possibilities. The continent holds great significance to the world. It is important to have a good perspective in the coming years. We, from the African countries, are embracing progress.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the vision of The Wave developed?</h4><p>The Wave was first conceived as an Integrated Tourism Complex (ITC) in 2004. It is part of Oman's Vision 2020, which is about the diversification of the economy away from oil. It was the first of the ITC projects that was envisioned and the original discussions came about in 2004-2005. The government of Oman needed to bring in some development expertise and it chose Majid Al Futtaim, a very well respected developer throughout the region. Majid Al Futtaim was well known for operating shopping malls here in Oman. The first master plan was completed in 2005 and the project was launched in mid to late 2006. It was very fortunate that the Wave was launched at a time when the markets were starting to reach their height, and its early success was measured in terms of its ability to achieve residential sales. Many people mistake projects like the Wave as being purely residential real estate projects. On the contrary, it is about delivering tourism infrastructure. It is about diversifying the economy and providing jobs. The residential real estate side is a crucial element, providing the cash flow to be able to fund tourism infrastructure, but not an end in itself. This is a very good model for the country to be able to attain tourism infrastructure at minimal cost to the taxpayer. It is a self-sustaining model. However, you need  to be very careful with this model of over-relying on residential sales.</p><h4>Have you seen a return of investor confidence in the market?</h4><p>The Wave was very fortunate to be launched at a time when the market was very active and we were able to make residential sales early. This provided the cash flow to give the project its impetus and momentum. This also gave the project enough build up so it was carried through the tough financial times as well. When the crisis came it gave us a real opportunity to go back to the drawing board and get back to the fundamentals of real estate and focus on who our target markets were; to focus on end-users rather than speculators.</p><div class="quote">“Mixed-use developments are all about maximizing all the various components to work together."</div><h4>When the global downturn hit, did you face customer defaults?</h4><p>Like every other project we had our share of defaults. People who paid 10% deposits and were half way through made a call that it was better to walk away from the investment. Our response was to sit down with them to come up with a solution. Together with our board we worked very hard on minimizing the number of defaults. That is the strength of having shareholders like the government of Oman and Majid Al Futtaim. They are not in there for the short term and are always intent on finding long-term sustainable solutions.</p><h4>Who is your target market?</h4><p>Around 50%-60% of sales are to Omanis, and the rest are to internationals, particularly non-resident Indians. We have a lot of long-term expatriate Indians who regard Oman as home. The ITC model, where they are allowed to buy the land freehold, gives them the opportunity to stay here. That is a very strong driver for that group. We also have a lot of people, particularly from the UK and the Netherlands from the oil and gas industry. These people have been here for a long time, and they see that this is their home so they want to buy real estate and live here.</p><h4>Do you think the trend of ITCs will continue?</h4><p>The government's current thinking is that there is a role for ITCs going forward. That model will continue, and the only concern there may be is that there were past instances where ITCs have been founded on unrealistic residential sales projections. This can result in serious cash flow deficits, which means they are unable to provide the tourism infrastructure. Development agreements for ITCs going forward will have far more onerous conditions on the delivery of tourism infrastructure. In short, the ITC model will continue, but it will be a lot more rigorous in terms of insuring that the tourism infrastructure gets delivered.</p><h4>How significant will the tourism element of the project be in the long term?</h4><p>It is absolutely critical. Tourism is what this project is all about. This is the great thing about mixed-use developments. If you take one element away, it just does not work quite as well. Mixed-use developments are all about maximizing all the various components to work together to provide a very vibrant, dynamic, and sustainable community. A residential community gives vibrancy to all of the hotels, the food and beverage, the golf courses, and the marinas; that community is a very important part of it.</p><h4>When will your commercial development come online?</h4><p>Our first retail/commercial center, which includes 12,000 sqm of retail and commercial space, will be opening in June 2014. The center is currently around 60% pre-leased. Retail lessees tend to take up space and commit early. However, on the commercial side, particularly offices, these tend to follow once completion has taken place.</p><h4>Could you describe the reef you have built at the marina?</h4><p>The reef is one of the largest in the world; two kilometers long with around 20,000 core locks. The reef also has a rock base about 70 meters wide and 20 meters high. Again, the efforts taken with respect to the design and construction of the reef goes to show the strength and the quality of this project, with no corners being cut. If you look at the quality of what we are delivering, it is truly of a world-class standard. Again, we are very fortunate that our shareholders want a long-term sustainable model.</p><h4>Is there a possibility of a Wave Salalah?</h4><p>At this stage, the straight answer is no. Having said that there will come a time when the Wave reaches its maximum development period and starts to wind down in a development sense and moves more into an asset management phase. This is likely to occur over the next three years. At that point, I think there will be an opportunity for the government of Oman to capitalize on the huge talent pool we have developed at The Wave. One of the things we are particularly proud of is that this was the first project of its type in Oman; back in 2006 there was no development industry in Oman and all of the expertise was provided by expatriates. Today, the project employs directly close to 200 people. Over 70% of those people are Omanis and a tremendous amount of intellectual property (IP) has been built up in this project. The other good thing is that Omanization is starting to filter through into the senior levels now. Our Deputy CEO is Omani, the last two or three VPs that we have employed are all Omanis, and so there is now less reliance on expatriates like myself. This has been a strong directive from our board and we have been successful on delivering in this regard.</p><h4>What is your overall outlook for the tourism sector in Oman?</h4><p>I think it is very strong. As a country, it has got all of the natural ingredients, from the natural beauty of the deserts, sea, beaches, and mountains, to the fascinating history and culture of its people. All the fundamentals are certainly there.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What contributions has Akkord Industry Construction Investment Corporation been making to the development of the local construction market and the non-oil sector in general?</h4><p>As a public interest entity, Akkord Corporation is strongly committed to making its contribution to the development of the local construction market and generally the non-oil sector of Azerbaijan's economy. Within a short period of time, Akkord Corporation managed to become a national leader in the construction business field. In Azerbaijan, we are currently involved in large-scale road infrastructure projects of a total contract value of approximately AZN314 million. To date, the corporation has completed infrastructure projects with a total contract value of more than $1.7 billion in Azerbaijan and abroad. In addition, the corporation has been continuously developing two other lines of its core business: the construction of real estate and public facilities, and the production and processing of construction materials. As an important construction materials supplier, we provide concrete and concrete precasts, asphalt, gravel, sand, bricks, fabricated metal products, and others—not only for our own needs, but also for the wider market in Azerbaijan. Notably, Akkord Corporation is finalizing the installation of the first production line of its brand new cement plant in the Gazakh region of Azerbaijan. In general, the corporation owns and operates 39 various plants throughout the country. Regarding real estate development, the corporation has constructed and commissioned 10 housing estates covering a residential area of more than 775,000 sqm and more than 56,000 sqm of commercial space in Baku. One of our most recent business directions is the construction of water supply and sewage infrastructure systems in Azerbaijan. Currently, Akkord Corporation is implementing 11 such projects in six regions of the country, with a total contract value of almost AZN300 million. At a conference dedicated to the results of the fourth year of the implementation of the State Program for Social and Economic Development of the Regions of the Republic of Azerbaijan for 2009-2013, held on February 12, 2013 under the chairmanship of President Ilham Aliyev, the Head of State restated the priority of development in the non-oil sector of the economy and the strengthening of the export potential of the country. Through heavy investments in industry and manufacturing, the introduction of new technology and know-how, and the creation of new workplaces, Akkord Corporation makes a substantial contribution to the development of the non-oil sector.</p><h4>What are some of the major domestic projects that Akkord is currently involved in?</h4><p>There are several publicly significant projects I would like to emphasize. A long-term Conceptual Development Scheme for the Baku Metro, prepared following the President's decree on November 10, 2008, and the “State Program for the Development of Baku Metro in 2011-2015," approved on March 18, 2011, laid the groundwork for the metro's expansion plans. In collaboration with our French partner, Bouygues, we established a joint venture to participate in this expansion project. On November 7, 2012, Akkord-Bouygues JV signed an MoU with the Baku Metro Authority to reconstruct the 28th May Station and build the new Khatai-Azi Aslanov-2 section, a seven-kilometer stretch of the green line. In general, the development plan envisages the construction of more than 50 metro stations and 165 kilometers of tunnels in the coming 20 years in Baku. Another project is the Gazakh Cement Plant in western Azerbaijan, the feasibility study of which was worked out by Deloitte. The plant, having the prospective production capacity of 3 million tons of cement per year, will enable us to meet up to 75% of local demand for cement. The plant's construction covers two stages. The first stage envisages the annual production of 1 million tons of cement and will be commissioned in mid-2013. The second stage will produce an additional 2 million tons of cement per year. The development of the Gazakh Cement Plant for Akkord is carried out by CBMI, a subsidiary of the world-renowned SINOMA of China. We will apply the dry cement production method at the plant and the majority of the 1,000 people working at the plant will be recruited locally. President Ilham Aliyev visited the Gazakh Cement Plant to familiarize himself with the construction on April 12, 2012, and evaluated the project very highly. Another essential project is a road-tunnel complex at Galaba Square in Baku. The project was designed by Surbana International Consultants of Singapore and an architectural design was developed by Venezia Design of Italy. The road-tunnel complex consists of six tunnels, eight pedestrian crossings, and two new exits at the Ganjlik metro station. So far, one tunnel has been completed and its opening ceremony was led by the President on December 28, 2012. Currently, it is the largest ongoing road-tunnel infrastructure project in Baku.</p><div class="quote">“Our aim is to expand beyond Azerbaijan."</div><h4>What is the geography and scope of Akkord Corporation's activities abroad?</h4><p>We are currently active in several foreign markets including Turkey, Afghanistan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Ukraine. In addition, in 2012 the corporation opened its representative office in Frankfurt, Germany. The current portfolio of ongoing road infrastructure projects in foreign countries amounts to $1.1 billion. In Uzbekistan, we are a contractor for a project to reconstruct the M39 Tashkent-Termez Road, while in Kazakhstan we are working on the construction of the Western Europe-Western China International Transit Corridor in the Kyzylorda region. In Georgia, we are implementing a project to construct the Kutaisi Bypass Road, and in Ukraine we are rebuilding the Kiev-Chop Road. Furthermore, in Turkey we are involved in the construction of the Akçagöz-Başpınar Road. This international exposure strengthens our experience and intensifies our business contacts with foreign partners such as Salini and Todini of Italy and Freyssinet and Freysas, subsidiaries of Vinci Group in France. We give priority to those projects funded by international financial institutions like the World Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), Asian Development Bank (ADB), and the Islamic Development Bank (IDB). In the future, we are planning to enter the Russian construction market to bid for infrastructure projects that will be announced by the Russian government due to the upcoming 2018 FIFA World Cup.  It is essential to bear in mind that in every foreign country, Akkord Corporation and its activities are representing Azerbaijan and its people. Therefore, we always deliver the best services and best products wherever we are working.</p><h4>What have been the main achievements of Akkord Corporation in the past two years? What are your future plans and goals?</h4><p>We managed to establish and strengthen a good team of professionals dedicated to their work. We have been heavily investing in human capital. A well-integrated corporate governance system was developed to add value to our business. Good governance, strengthened internal controls, and internal audits as well as risk management systems have also been implemented at Akkord. Moreover, we managed to diversify the sources of our financing and improve financial stability. Additionally in 2012, the corporation's charter capital was increased to AZN84 million. Akkord improved its financial reporting standards based on IFRS and contracted Deloitte as external corporate auditors. PwC has been contracted as a rating advisor for the first time assessment of Akkord by Fitch Ratings. In 2013, we are renewing our corporate rating and re-launching our Eurobond project to gain access to low-cost international financial markets. In parallel, we are continuing to bid for new projects domestically and internationally. Our aim is to expand beyond Azerbaijan and become an internationally competitive transnational corporation.</p><h4>How would you evaluate Azerbaijan's economic development and competitiveness level in the international market?</h4><p>Azerbaijan's economic successes are considerable. In the Global Competitiveness Index 2012-2013 by the World Economic Forum, Azerbaijan rose by nine positions and ranked 46 among 144 countries. This means that Azerbaijan is among the 50 most competitive economies in the world. The economic strategy set by President Aliyev precluded the negative impacts of the global financial crisis and ensured steady economic growth. The economy's high growth rates, clear and consistent government investment programs, measures on the diversification of the economy, and continuous support for the development of the non-oil sector will ensure long-lasting economic and social benefits for Azerbaijan and its people.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the significance for Colombia of the Sixth Summit of the Americas celebrated in Cartagena in 2012?</h4><p>The Sixth Summit of the Americas gave us the opportunity to propose to the countries of the region to concentrate on advancing the achievements of the two hemispheres, mainly integration and comprehensive development. Our proposals were widely supported by member states and became a concrete action plan for the Americas in the coming years. The Cartagena Summit will also be remembered as the first continental meeting to hold, at the highest level, an open and frank exchange of views on the most divisive issues on the Americas' agenda. In Cartagena, the hemispheric political dialogue gained a new dimension. Among others, and as a result of it, the OAS is preparing an analytical study on the region's current antidrug policy and on existing alternatives to give more strength and effectiveness to our fight against this scourge.</p><h4>What have been your Ministry's major accomplishments over the past two years and what are your priorities for 2013?</h4><p>Over the past two-and-a-half years, we have implemented a policy of reaching out to new partners in Central Asia and the Pacific as well as expanding the thematic issues and areas of exchange and cooperation with our traditional partners. Likewise, we have focused on two social programs with economic impact in small municipalities bordering our neighboring countries. These are the Border Plan for Prosperity and the Children and Youth Opportunities Program. Our priorities for 2013 are developing these approaches both with our traditional and new partners, enhancing our work in Colombia's territories in the Caribbean basin, strengthening our cooperation with Central America and the Caribbean, reinforcing our partnerships with Latin American countries, and consolidating the Pacific Alliance as a pragmatic partnership that will bring major benefits to all the economies involved.</p><div class="quote">“We certainly need to continue our bilateral and regional engagement with all countries."</div><h4>How would you assess bilateral relations between the US and Colombia and in what areas is there more potential for cooperation?</h4><p>We have had, for many years, a special relationship with the US. Our successes in combatting major global challenges in Colombia are also their successes due to the commitment and cooperation of successive US governments. During this administration, we have sought to expand the agenda items for dialogue and exchange. From an almost monothematic agenda, we have now strengthened our areas of cooperation in the agriculture and energy sectors as well as in science and technology and the environment and sustainability. They are all essential for our development and the creation of prosperity.</p><h4>What has been the most important change in Colombian society in recent years?</h4><p>Since the beginning of my tenure, I have strived to highlight the positive environment of our new reality and the opportunities it can offer both Colombians and the world. This is a challenge, as there is a problem of perception within the international system related to our past realities, which we have able to overcome in many aspects. But indeed, the major challenge is for Colombians to feel they are on an equal footing with nationals of any other countries, after having been stigmatized for so many years. This change in our own attitude is essential in order to explore new regions and markets and feel confident about our strengths in human capital, as an investment destination, and also the quality and competitiveness of our industries.</p><h4>What role has Colombia played in promoting regional cooperation and development?</h4><p>In terms of cooperation, we have focused on offering programs in security matters and counter-narcotics to Central America and the Caribbean. International organized crime, with all its ramifications, concerns and affects us all; thus, the need to strengthen the capacities of all nations if we, as an international community, want to achieve successful results in the near future. We have extended this cooperation to some African countries afflicted with similar challenges.</p><h4>What are Colombia's priorities in the region?</h4><p>We certainly need to continue our bilateral and regional engagement with all countries as well as with the sub-regional and regional organizations. Notwithstanding the efforts undertaken in the various mechanisms, we will focus our attention on the full implementation of the agreements and sectorial commitments derived from the Pacific Alliance. This pragmatic approach of the Alliance and its vision to engage with third nations and organizations in the Asia Pacific offers the opportunities Colombia needs to continue with its engagement in Asia and with the international major economic, political, and financial currents.</p><h4>Currently, Colombia has eight FTAs with 15 countries. What are your prospects for FTAs with other nations in 2013?</h4><p>Colombia has a network of FTAs, ADTs, and BITs that allows us to reach out to 1.5 billion potential consumers all over the world. Apart from the FTAs that we have with Latin American countries, we have agreements in force with the US, Canada, and EFTA-Switzerland and Liechtenstein. Soon, we will complete the ratification process of the agreement with the EU, which was approved by the European Parliament in December 2012. We have concluded negotiations with the Republic of Korea and we are currently negotiating with Japan, Costa Rica, and Israel.</p><h4>What role do you envision playing in Latin America?</h4><p>We want to be a constructive member of this region and provide opportunities for engagement. We have worked with all the countries, acknowledging our potential and competitive advantages for success, and we will remain committed to this policy. Latin America has it all and we want to empower our region to become more competitive in order to foster growth aimed at improving the lives and livelihoods of all our citizens.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[got-the-capacity]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>To what extent has LAM developed as Mozambique's national flag carrier since its establishment as part of the ports and railways service in 1936?</h4><p>Linhas Aéreas de Moçambique (LAM) was created in 1936 as Divisío de Exploraçío de Transportes Aéreos (DETA). At that time, the service was mainly to accommodate the transport of passengers to and from nearby countries. It was also created to establish a connection between the south and the north of the country to complement the service being provided by the railways. When Mozambique achieved independence, the government decided to restructure the sector and separated the transport service from the railways to develop them separately. The air transport company then adopted the name Linhas Aérea de Moçambique (LAM). At that time, the company owned four Boeing aircraft, and then later it bought a DC-10. In 1991, we started providing regular services to Lisbon, Paris, Rome, Madrid, Berlin, Sophia, Copenhagen, and Dubai. We also flew charters and contracted flights. Some of the destinations were, Havana, Boston, Mecca, Dhaka, and others. Since then, there have been changes in the airline business, as it became a private entity in 1998 when the government owned 80% and the employees took a 20% share.</p><h4>How have you adapted domestic scheduling to cope with changing demand?</h4><p>We moved to a new type of aircraft to accommodate the flexibility that is required for different routes. With smaller aircrafts, i.e., the Embraer (E190) and the Bombardiers (Q400), we are offering more direct flights than we were using the larger Boeings with which we were offering multi-leg flights. We are growing quickly and our need to increase capacity is also rising. Two years ago, we were flying two or three times a week to most of our destinations, but we are now flying two times a day. This is a tremendous change and we are increasing the size of the fleet to deal with the growing demand. Prior to doing this, we were combining Tete with Quelimane for instance, and we would have two frequencies. Now we can have dedicated flights to each of these two destinations. There is flexibility and we need to accommodate.</p><div class="quote">“We have emerged from huge debts because of poor revenue management to making a profit."</div><h4>Is LAM's public service duty one of the barriers standing in the way of low-cost air travel in Mozambique?</h4><p>It could be, yes. If we had more capacity we could have lower travel costs. Everything costs less when you have more supply. This applies to the cost of the ticket as well as the cost of the aircraft, accommodation, and food. I believe that more capacity will make things better, because the more passengers we fly the more fixed costs will be diluted. There is a difference between low-cost and low-price carriers. To be low cost, you need to have low costs so you can charge a low price. In Mozambique, nothing is cheap. There is no way you could operate a low-cost airline here, unless you have lower direct operation costs including jet fuel, taxes, user charges, aircraft acquisition, safety, and security charges. The market is open for low-cost airlines, but it is too expensive to operate here, meaning it would be difficult to launch one. People say it is difficult to develop tourism because of expensive air transport, but what about the hotels? Until we have the volumes to bring all the costs of tourism down, then tourism will have difficulties to develop at a rapid pace. The developed countries didn't develop over night; it was a process and I believe Mozambique is in that process. It will take some time, but we are getting there. There are many airlines flying to Mozambique now.</p><h4>LAM is looking for a strategic partner for LAM International. How is that progressing?</h4><p>When talking about LAM International, we need to think about who is going to travel, and how many passengers we will have. Qatar Airways currently flies everywhere at the cheapest prices it can offer. At the moment, we don't have enough passengers to go intercontinental because many Mozambicans still lack basic needs and only a few can afford to travel. I don't think we have enough traffic at the moment until we develop the capacity for Mozambicans to travel around the country first. Also, our strategy is to develop domestic and regional traffic, and then build up to intercontinental travel. We are planning to fly to all the South African Development Community (SADC) countries by 2015. We launched the flight to Zimbabwe in 2012 and we are now working toward Malawi. For Mozambicans to fly intercontinentally, you need to make sure you have enough flights, because if you have one flight per week no one will want to go as they will have to wait a week before they can come back. People need some flexibility. That means that you need to offer three flights per week.</p><h4>What is your occupancy rate at the moment?</h4><p>In the peak season, for intercontinental service it will reach 70%; however, in the low season it will go down to 30%. You need an average of 70% across the year to make a profit. We used to have this in the past and I believe we will in the future. We had a flight to Lisbon in 2011, but it did not go well. Even though the peak season was good when everyone was on holiday, the low season occupancy rates drop but the costs did not. You need to get enough traffic to cover the entire season.</p><h4>Which are your most profitable routes?</h4><p>Domestically, I don't think we have one that is the most profitable as all of our routes are busy. In terms of cost efficiency, the one-hour flights are the most profitable in terms of cost effectiveness as they spend less fuel. Nampula is a very good flight for us, which is also almost always full year round. Regionally, Johannesburg is a profitable route for us as it is very close and quick. The costs in South Africa are much lower as well, such as for catering and fuel. The demand is always there as well throughout the year; however, there is more competition with other airlines in South Africa.</p><h4>In 2011 you had a 15% increase in profit. What were the main contributing factors to that growth?</h4><p>Our industry is very influenced by currency. In 2011, the metical appreciated up. Almost 80% of our costs are indexed to the US dollar, so whenever the metical devalues we need more meticais to pay the same US dollar bill, but then it works the opposite way as well. This factor had a good influence in our increased profits. We also have an excellent revenue management scheme. We used to have our flights full of low prices, but what we do now is allocate different seats into different price brackets to make it profitable. We have emerged from huge debts because of poor revenue management to making a profit. We have managed flights within the same tariffs allowing cheaper prices when the demand is lower, which has paid off.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Down in Duqm]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[down-in-duqm]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did the vision of Duqm develop?</h4><p>The government of Oman and His Majesty feel that during the past 40 years we have developed many of Oman's regions, and now it is time to focus on the Al Wusta Governorate. We are doing this by taking advantage of Duqm's strategic location to create a first-class industrial zone with associated free zones and a large port. That is the reason we have built one of the biggest ports, around 140 square kilometers in size, in the Middle East and North Africa. The free zone itself is around 1,777 square kilometers, which is also one of the largest in the MENA area. The strategic location means we can attract shipping lines, and the port can serve the Far East and our neighbors in India, Pakistan, East Africa, Europe, and the GCC. The zone we have designed is also more integrated, with individual subzones, including tourism, training and education, logistics, ports, the dry dock, light and heavy industrial fishing, and cement and building materials. The zone will also have an international airport with cargo capabilities, as well as a train station, through which most of the goods coming through the port will be transported to neighboring countries.</p><h4>How far through the construction process is Duqm currently?</h4><p>The dry dock is working at full capacity. The port already started commercial activity, though on a limited scale. The dry dock is being managed by a South Korean Company, DAEWOO, while the port is being managed by the Port of Antwerp. The government of Oman and the Port of Antwerp have established a joint venture, the Port of Duqm Company, which is running the port. Even when the work is finished, there will still be a lot more to do, especially in storage and logistics. Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) and other oil companies have started to use the port to ship and transport large equipment to their oil fields in and around Duqm. This equipment comes in through the ports of neighboring countries at great cost to the companies. Duqm Port will reduce the distance and cost of transportation. Other logistics companies, including DHL, have expressed an interest in setting up an office in Duqm.</p><div class="quote">“Oman is known for its beautiful natural assets. We were the first country in the Middle East to have a Ministry of Environment."</div><h4>Are you looking to redirect business to your port from other operators, or generate new business?</h4><p>The business generated by this new port and its attendant facilities will be new business for Oman. Duqm will complement the existing ports in Oman, as the government of Oman has planned a specialist capability for each port. Salalah specializes in transportation, Muscat in cruise ships, Sohar is industrial, and Duqm will concentrate on cargo plus other things. We will complement each other, working for the benefit of Oman. Duqm's greatest advantage lies in its size; we will not face the problems that others face regarding expansion, because we have dedicated a huge area of land. Duqm is built on a greenfield site on which there were no houses or buildings.</p><h4>How important will the refinery be?</h4><p>The refinery will add tremendous value to Duqm. It is already doing so, with many companies already doing studies so they can start construction in 2014. It is projected that by the end of 2017 the refinery will be in operation. Oman Oil is playing a big role in the development of Duqm with its investments in the refinery, petroleum jetty, and petrochemical industries. We are happy with the overall progress in Duqm and feel confident about job creation for Omanis.</p><h4>How important is tourism to diversify Duqm's economy?</h4><p>The coastline in Duqm is extremely clean because it is far away from population centers and less affected by pollution, so it is an ideal area in which to promote tourism. We have a special zone for tourism with 26 square kilometers and 18 kilometers of beaches, which is not small. The Crown Plaza Hotel is already completed and there are plans for further hotels. We have a request from other investors to build a waterpark in Duqm. It is not finalized, and discussions are ongoing, but we can use that to make it more attractive for tourists. To make it more attractive we need to link it by train. This authority was established 13 months ago and we have already managed to link Duqm with Muscat by plane three times a week. We'd like to see it on a daily basis to make Duqm a weekend getaway destination. Our airport will cater for both domestic and international passengers and cargo, attracting tourists from across the GCC. This is one of the visions of His Majesty; to create something huge to diversify the economy. The Duqm project will develop the Al Wusta region, create jobs for Omanis, and contribute to the country's GDP. This is a region about which His Majesty has thought for a long time, and now we are implementing what he has in mind and we hope we can achieve his expectations for the country. Where there used to be a very low population, we now have at least 11,700 people carrying out different activities living in Duqm. All the properties in Duqm will be available for lease rather than ownership, and we don't have any restrictions when it comes to foreigners. It is a 100% foreign ownership zone.</p><h4>What initiatives are you making to preserve the natural beauty of the landscape?</h4><p>Oman is known for its beautiful natural assets. We were the first country in the Middle East to have a Ministry of Environment. His Majesty wants to safeguard the environment, so we have very strict environmental standards. Here in Duqm, we have kept the industrial plants far from the beaches and the tourism infrastructure. We have designed Duqm with this in mind, with a big buffer between each zone to avoid contamination. In addition, the wind in Duqm blows predominantly from the south to the north and sometimes from the west to the east, so we have placed the refinery downwind of the residential and tourism areas. The Ministry of Environment has been very helpful and has sent some of its staff to work with us to provide expertise and advice.</p><h4>How many jobs will Duqm create for Omanis?</h4><p>We expect the total population of Duqm to be around 67,000 by 2020. That is the expectation, and Duqm already has 11,700. The refinery is expected to draw in big numbers. Right now there are about 31 companies with contractors or subcontractors working here. Because this is a specialized economy, we don't want to have a very rigid policy of Omanization. I feel that once we have a good training center in Duqm, we will see percentages beyond what we have planned. We have planned 20% and I am sure it will go beyond that. People want to see local people to help them communicate with the residents, locals, and neighbors. For example, in the dry dock, the Omanization percentage is good even though it is new. It has gone beyond 25% and we are planning an even higher ratio.</p><h4>How are you promoting Duqm on the world stage?</h4><p>One way is through road shows, and another is through conferences. We also use our website and booklets. We have to be very careful because we don't want people to have too high expectations too early. We are still doing a lot of construction and building a lot of infrastructure. we are careful about promoting certain other areas where work is still required to make it ready for investors.</p><h4>When will the area be running at full capacity?</h4><p>I think by 2020 if we continue at the same speed. We can be proud that in these 13 months we have achieved so much. It would not have been possible without the full support of the entire government. We have full support from every ministry because we all want to meet the visions of His Majesty to put Duqm Special Economic Zone on the world map.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Abu Dhabi's government plans to diversify its GDP from 60% oil and gas to 40%. How do you see BP fitting into this vision?</h4><p>I believe that a diversified economy is important to any nation. Abu Dhabi's leadership took a step toward diversification two years ago to set the nation up for the future, which is a great move. Where does BP fit into this? BP has been in Abu Dhabi for 74 years, and it has played a significant role in the oil industry. Since the production of oil began in 1958, our aim has been to be involved in the market. We want to work with the Abu Dhabi government to improve the recovery of oil, but we are also committed to making a contribution to the nation more broadly through support for education and the development of human capability.</p><h4>How would you describe the relationship between BP and its joint venture partner ADNOC?</h4><p>From BP's perspective, our partnership with the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) has been very successful. Through our enduring relationship, we have helped to establish a world-class oil industry and a set of assets that are high quality and which we have invested in for many years, delivering oil production and revenues. BP has played a significant role in the Abu Dhabi oil industry since the 1930s and was at the forefront of the discovery of oil in the Emirate in 1958. Our partnership with Abu Dhabi has endured over seven decades, contributing to the growth of the nation, while providing value to BP. Our shareholdings in the country's operating companies contribute a significant share to BP's worldwide production. Today, our interests in Abu Dhabi include shareholdings in the Abu Dhabi Marine Operating Company (ADMA-OPCO) (14.67%), the Abu Dhabi Company for Onshore Oil Operations (ADCO) (9.5%), the Abu Dhabi Gas Liquefaction Company (ADGAS) (10%), the Natural Gas Shipping Company (NGSCO) (10%), and Bunduq Company Limited (3%). BP seconds a number of specialists to provide technical and managerial support to ADNOC and the operating companies. We also invest in developing local capabilities, including through seconding national staff to different BP locations.</p><div class="quote">“BP has been in Abu Dhabi for 74 years, and it has played a significant role in the oil industry."</div><h4>How can international and local companies work together to further develop the oil and gas sector?</h4><p>One obvious area is partnership through joint-venture companies. ADCO is an onshore company that handles one of the oldest concessions in the world. It is 75 years old, and BP has also been there from day one. Historically, most of the nations in this part of the world had little capability and lacked good technical education programs. In the last 30-40 years, the growth of the energy sector in Abu Dhabi in particular has improved dramatically. The UAE now has fantastic capability in running huge operations. However, challenges remain as the era of easy oil and gas extraction is almost over, and thus sustaining and increasing production are becoming more difficult. There are people who can still manage the situation, but we need the right technology and know-how to extract difficult resources. That is why joint ventures and collaboration are so important. One company works to bring together resources and people, while the other might specialize in contributing technology, know-how, and expertise.</p><h4>How important is this region to multinational companies?</h4><p>This region has vast reserves of oil and gas, comprising of around 40%-50% of the world's hydrocarbon resources. Shale gas and shale oil have changed the game in the US, and absolutely no one can deny that. However, with so much growth in energy demand expected in the coming decades, particularly from China and India, the provision of energy from the Middle East region remains essential to the world economy. The world's population is increasing and has reached a figure almost double the population 40 years ago.</p><h4>What effect is US shale gas and Venezuelan oil having on the market?</h4><p>The US shale energy revolution is obviously an important development. Technological innovation and supportive industry regulation have unlocked vast unconventional resources in the US, reversing the trend of falling output and altering global energy balances. Shale gas growth will gradually spread beyond the US. In BP's recently published Energy Outlook 2030, we see shale gas as the big growth story in OECD countries, providing more than enough gas to meet the projected increase in OECD gas demand. However, despite all the attention surrounding the shale gas revolution, in volume terms the bigger story with gas is the expansion of mostly conventional production in non-OECD countries, with the Middle East being the largest contributor.</p><h4>What trends have you noticed in production?</h4><p>As an Emirate, Abu Dhabi has clear plans. The country plans to increase production capacity to 3.5 million barrels per day (bbl/d) or higher. We have a project in place to achieve this goal. In addition, BP has a range of different interests: a 9.5% stake in ADCO, the onshore company that is producing 1.4 million bbl/d, and a 14.6% stake in ADMA-OPCO, the offshore company. ADCO also has projects in place, and that will add to production. ADCO is undertaking a huge capacity-building program. Similarly, there are an increased number of capital-intensive projects being led by ADMA-OPCO offshore to improve production capacity and oil capacity. We are going upward and we foresee no decrease. Abu Dhabi as a whole is enlarging its capabilities.</p><h4>With oilfields maturing and enhanced oil recovery methods, how can BP contribute to the growth and development of the UAE's energy sector?</h4><p>BP is helping ADMA-OPCO to implement what we call the “digital oilfield" in brownfields and new developments that bring in technology to help increase production efficiency, increase recovery factors, and improve safety. We have worked with ADNOC to study the use of carbon dioxide in enhanced oil recovery within ADCO's North East Bab fields. We have also been supporting the Abu Dhabi Petroleum Institute in developing its enhanced oil recovery research capability. More broadly, BP has great expertise in advanced seismic imaging to help optimize reservoir productivity. BP leads the industry in a new wave of enhanced oil recovery technologies. To squeeze more oil from existing reservoirs, BP undertakes more secondary recovery—a conventional water flooding technique to enhance production—than any other international oil company globally. BP is a leading expert on water flooding, a type of enhanced oil recovery, and we are maximizing recovery from some of the world's largest reservoirs.</p><h4>How does BP encourage Emiratis to enter the workforce?</h4><p>One of our key contributions to developing world-class Emirati capability is our decade of support for the Petroleum Institute. We are extremely proud of this relationship with Abu Dhabi's pre-eminent petroleum sciences and engineering university, which has inspired hundreds of young Emiratis and equipped them with the skills for careers in oil and gas. One of the impacts that I see when I visit the Petroleum Institute is that we are growing a talent stream of ambitious young engineers and petroleum scientists who have great careers ahead of them.</p><h4>What opportunities do you see in 2013 for BP?</h4><p>We have been in Abu Dhabi for 75 years, and we certainly hope to be here for the future. We believe what a company brings to the table in terms of people, technology, capacity building, engagement with the government, and oil recovery is what counts. The competition is high, but we have a great contribution to make as a world leader in technology. The reality is that Abu Dhabi's needs over the last 50 years are different from what the Emirate will need in the coming half century. We are an advanced company compared to others, especially in terms of our seismic imaging. We are a pioneer in that technology, and we also have unsurpassed experience in managing giant oil fields and water flooding. We have a number of new technologies that make us distinct from the competition and that can be applied to benefit Abu Dhabi. That is how we can add value to Abu Dhabi.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does Ecuador play in Telefónica's global operations?</h4><p>Ecuador is a market of operations that officially became part of Grupo Telefónica in 2005, when we launched Movistar in the country. At the moment, Ecuador represents a very small market for the company. However, we have developed a very clear model for operations, and our results are an impressive benchmark for other regional markets. Therefore, the work done by the Ecuadorean team is highly recognized within the company. Today, we employ around 1,300 people in Ecuador.</p><h4>What are some of the latest technological advancements that the company plans to introduce into the market?</h4><p>There are two key attributes that differentiate Telefónica from its main competitors: technological innovation and excellence in customer service. These are the pillars of our operations everywhere and the basis of our competitiveness. Not long ago, the group underwent a restructuring process. Today, all of our operations in Latin America are part of the same geographical segment of operations. In this regard, the group also established Telefónica Digital, which channels all the creative capacity of the group that was previously dispersed throughout the many markets in which we operate. Our aim is not to become a commodity in the industry, and that is a differentiating point for us. Therefore, Telefónica seeks to provide value-added services to our customers with no need for third parties. At the end of the day, we are the ones who heavily invest in the network and services. For this reason, we will further deepen our innovation levels in these value-added services.</p><div class="quote">“Ecuador still needs to further capitalize on the potential of the 3G network and its technology before eyeing 4G."</div><h4>What is the potential for LTE and 4G technology to catch on in a market like Ecuador?</h4><p>The main decision is to take each step at the right time. In my personal opinion, Ecuador still needs to further capitalize on the potential of the 3G network and its technology before eyeing 4G. At the moment, the penetration of mobile internet stands at around 10%, and for that single reason, 4G does not make much sense for this market. In this regard, I believe that we should focus on investing resources in the expansion of 3G and its services in the next few years, as that would lay the foundations for future developments, among them the implementation of 4G. It would be much better to focus on providing 3G services to the entire country, rather than just implementing 4G in Quito and Guayaquil, cities that are always leading the technological advancements in Ecuador. Telefónica prioritizes the first option, and in this regard we need to be granted a broader spectrum in order to offer even better services to our customers.</p><h4>How would the undersea cable, which is planned to be operative in 2014, impact the operations of Telefónica Ecuador?</h4><p>Since it is a wholesale business, its impact on our operations will not be different from the impact on other market operators. The undersea cable will definitely increase the flow of international data traffic, something very important for the country. It will also reduce costs and improve services.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Telecommunications Regulation Authority (TRA) is tasked with ensuring the UAE becomes a regional ICT hub. How would you evaluate your performance so far?</h4><p>The TRA is building the core ICT regulatory framework for the UAE's burgeoning knowledge economy and it regulates the UAE's telecommunications sector to ensure that competition provides affordable and reliable telecommunications services. The TRA licensed Emirates Integrated Telecommunications Corporation (du) as the UAE's second national operator in 2006. Since commencing service delivery in 2007, du has largely focused on the mobile communications market and, by the end of 2012, it had secured almost 50% of the mobile market in terms of subscriber numbers. The positive effects of competition in the UAE telecommunications sector are now being witnessed by customers, who enjoy some of the lowest mobile tariffs in the GCC. In terms of fixed-line telecommunications services, the UAE has some of the most advanced networks in the world with a very high penetration of fiber to home connections over which the licensees deliver innovative triple-play (voice, internet, and TV) services to customers. The policies of the TRA and the advanced networks deployed in the UAE enable modern UAE society to function with a high level of connectivity and affordable and reliable telecommunications services. In short, I am proud of the TRA's performance so far.</p><h4>What role must the TRA and the telecommunications sector play in Abu Dhabi's strategy to become a diversified business center by 2030?</h4><p>The TRA must continue to support the development of the industry while promoting the interests of end-users. Supporting the development of the sector will ensure that the licensees continue to invest in new technologies and innovative service offerings. This is vital to ensuring businesses in Abu Dhabi take advantage of high-quality ICT infrastructure that may, in turn, give them a competitive advantage in the markets they compete in. Furthermore, by promoting the interests of end-users, we can ensure that they receive good value for their ICT spending. Overall, it is important that the TRA continues to provide a balanced, impartial response to the needs of all stakeholders; the government, the licensees, and the consumers.</p><div class="quote">“Instead of focusing on the number of licensees, we should focus on what is being delivered."</div><h4>Is there room for another mobile carrier?</h4><p>We should think of quality and not quantity. So, instead of focusing on the number of licensees, we should focus on what is being delivered. The UAE has one of the highest degrees of mobile penetration in the world. We also have some of the lowest mobile tariffs. World-leading technology—4G(LTE)—is deployed on both networks and is widely accessible in the UAE—and from the TRA's consumer surveys we know that users generally have a high degree of satisfaction with the services supplied to them. At this point in time, the TRA has no plans to issue further mobile licenses. The TRA is happy with the way that the mobile market has developed and notes that the sector displays highly competitive characteristics. Having said that, the regulatory framework is an evolving process and, as such, the TRA constantly reviews the effectiveness of competition to ensure that the structure of the market remains appropriate.</p><h4>Many internet users still connect by dial-up because of the prices attached to broadband plans. Is there an opportunity here for regulation to improve services and prices for consumers?</h4><p>The TRA supervises the development of the UAE's online infrastructure and has enabled the UAE to become one of the world's most connected societies with 72% of households having access to broadband internet. The TRA is working closely with the licensees to implement a form of network sharing known as bit stream access. This will increase competition in the fixed services market and exert downward pressure on a range of fixed-line services, including broadband.</p><h4>Just recently companies have been sharing their dark fiber networks. How will this improve services for customers?</h4><p>Such arrangements are been carried out as a result of commercial negotiations between the parties involved. The TRA is not involved in these negotiations and is unaware of such agreements. Nonetheless, the TRA considers that dark fiber sharing, as with other forms of infrastructure sharing, can reduce the costs of service provision, which has the potential to reduce prices. This is an outcome that the TRA is seeking to achieve through other regulatory measures such as the introduction of the bit stream access service.</p><h4>The TRA has been running the “My Number, My Identity" program over past few months. Could you tell us a little bit about the program, and why it is encouraged?</h4><p>This campaign is in line with our continuous efforts to protect the interests and privacy of mobile users, and is based on studies and surveys that indicated an increase in civil and criminal cases. These are due to some mobile subscribers giving away their SIM cards to other users who may misuse the number, resulting in serious legal or financial issues for the actual owners. The TRA took several steps to organize registration processes and requirements for mobile phone services provided by the two licensees. The TRA launched the “My Number, My Identity" campaign in collaboration with the licensees, aiming to increase awareness of the new registration procedures. The campaign highlights the importance of the mobile subscribers' role in protecting their SIM cards. These should not be given out to other users in order to avoid any misuse that may occur, as the registered owner of the number will be legally and financially accountable.</p><h4>In the coming months Yahsat will start to enter the local market as a broadband provider. What is the role of the TRA in protecting this new company from being priced out by Etisalat and Du?</h4><p>The TRA supports the UAE's ICT sector by safeguarding competition to protect the interests of subscribers, enhancing the readiness of e-services, and encouraging investment, innovation, and development. The TRA has a range of regulatory measures in place designed to protect competition and to prevent licensees from subjecting other licensees to anti-competitive conduct. For example, the TRA's Competition Safeguards Regulatory Policy, dated September 30, 2010, prohibits the misuse of market power including, among other things, predatory pricing, margin squeezing, and discrimination against competitors. The TRA also has a price approval policy whereby licensees must submit any proposed prices to the TRA for advanced approval. This includes all price changes for existing services and prices for new services. The TRA reviews the proposed prices with a view to ensuring that, among other things, the prices implemented within the market are not anti-competitive and will not have a detrimental impact on competition. In addition, the TRA is currently working on a project to define a set of competition remedies for markets in which one or both of the operators have been identified as having market power.</p><h4>The TRA has encouraged telecoms providers to introduce mobile number portability (MNP). Why is this important?</h4><p>MNP will allow the customers to retain their mobile number when switching network operators, and this will give them the freedom to choose their preferred network operator without worrying about their number changing. At the same time, MNP will enhance competition among network operators, and hence it would enhance services. MNP will be to the benefit of the end customer in general.</p><h4>At a recent GCC meeting the TRA proposed the creation of the .arab domain name. What potential does this have?</h4><p>The internet today has labels representing countries. The League of Arab States and the TRA envision .arab to serve the entire Arab region. It shall create new opportunities for businesses and individuals unifying us on the internet. We are at the birth of a new beginning and we are going to fully support it. We believe .arab has very strong potential for success.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Barwa Bank has received several accolades recently, especially in relation to sukuk funds. What do these awards represent for the bank?</h4><p>We picked up nine awards in total during 2012, and another two in January 2013. We see awards as recognition by commentators, customers, and our industry peers of what we are doing and, just as important, the way that we are doing it. Obviously, they are part of the way in which we look at success. The acid-test of success is our financial results, but there are others things that reinforce our belief that we are doing the right thing.</p><h4>What is Barwa Bank's positioning in the Qatari market?</h4><p>We are the newest, youngest, and fastest growing Islamic bank in Qatar. We are focused and differentiated and do not seek to be all-things-to-all-men, competing hard in areas where we believe we can add value to relationships.</p><div class="quote">“A rating facilitates access to the international capital markets and provides quality assurance to potential counterparties."</div><h4>How did legislation passed in 2011 limiting the number of financial institutions that can offer Islamic banking services affect your customer base?</h4><p>It has been overwhelmingly positive. To find oneself in a marketplace with sharply reduced competition and in a segment that is growing faster than conventional banking is obviously a desirable place to be. For customers for whom sharia-compliant banking is important, we have an advantage as one of four Islamic banks in Qatar and we have seen a movement of customers,  assets, and balances from the conventional banks. It has been an interesting period for us.</p><h4>Does Barwa Bank have any plans to engage in further international sukuk transactions?</h4><p>Indeed, we do. We have a number of opportunities in the pipeline, as well as issuers that we see coming to market over the next few months.</p><h4>What are your comments on Barwa Bank's pursuit of a credit rating?</h4><p>Banking is a rated industry, and like all banks we need a rating. We had a very strong 2011, followed it up with a strong performance in 2012, and have had a very positive first quarter. We intend to start the rating process in 2013. A rating facilitates access to the international capital markets and provides quality assurance to potential counterparties, some of whom may be unfamiliar with Barwa Bank and Qatar in general.</p><h4>How do you differentiate yourselves in such a heavily saturated market?</h4><p>We are new entrants to a crowded market place and differentiation is essential if we are to succeed. One only has to look out the window to realize that Qatar has a lot of banks—there is no room for another “me-too" proposition. We are not a mass-market retail bank and our core focus on the retail side is upon affluent progressive Qataris who are demanding and discerning. We aim to be a first-class bank that can deliver excellent service and a sophisticated product proposition as good as anything available in the conventional sector, though in a sharia-compliant manner.</p><h4>What sort of services do you offer to your clients?</h4><p>We offer a full range of banking and investment services with an emphasis on responsiveness and customer service quality. In addition, we introduce our customers to unique investment opportunities that are available only through Barwa Bank. We have an investment banking subsidiary (The First Investor) and an increasingly sophisticated treasury team who “manufacture" with the bank focused upon distribution. Good examples might be our Brazilian Real Estate Income fund, structured products (the Turkey &amp; Indonesia Equity Note we did in 2012 was very popular) through to more exotic examples like the Colored Diamond Fund we run with Aspreys of London.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the banking sector in the coming years?</h4><p>Given the rapid growth of the economy and the ambitious plans set out in the National Vision, the scope and scale of the opportunity here in Qatar is very significant indeed. I would say the outlook is extraordinarily positive.</p><h4>What about the medium-term plans for the bank?</h4><p>Well, our strategy seems to be the right one; we have moved from operating losses to significant profits in two-and-a-half years, so we will press on doing more of what we are doing. We will continue to build-out our corporate banking franchise—where we are already a meaningful player—and participate to the utmost in the major financing opportunities associated with the infrastructural development projects that lie ahead. At the same time, we are committed to the expansion of our institutional proposition and see the development of regional and global Islamic capital markets as a real opportunity for us. Sukuk-related activity is the best example. On the personal side, we will open some new branches; this will be highly selective and consistent with our positioning as a boutique bank with a focus on customer experience. At an appropriate time, we intend to be a listed company and, in due course, to build out from Qatar in terms of regional and international presence.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The country has tripled its investment in the public health field since 2007. What have been the key projects implemented by your Ministry?</h4><p>The current government of Ecuador has invested around $7 billion in public health projects from 2007 to 2012. The project that represents the largest investment is the construction and rehabilitation of hospital infrastructure across the country. For example, in Guayaquil, the largest city in our country, the Ministry of Public Health did not invest in the creation of more hospital beds for the last 30 years, and that needed to be addressed. Overall, the demand for public health services and infrastructure has grown in the country; however, the supply of health services has not followed along. Up until now, we mostly focused on rehabilitating existing infrastructure, whereas from now on we will put an emphasis on the development of new projects. In 2013, we have a geographical strategy that provides the framework and guide to what and where needs to be built in Ecuador in terms of hospital infrastructure. At the same time, we have revised bureaucratic processes in order to facilitate and speed up the above-mentioned processes and dynamics. In 2013 alone, we will invest $930 million in ongoing and new projects, which represents the largest and most significant investment in public health carried out in Ecuador for the last two decades. We have a strategic development plan for the next 10 years, we are constructing 100 health centers now, and we plan to build over 900 new health centers over the next four years. In this context, and since we are the most important health service provider in the country, we always aim to raise quality standards to international levels. In 2012, we provided over 40 million services, which represented around 110,000 services per day. In parallel, we put great efforts into continuing to facilitate the access of Ecuadorean citizens to the public health system. The main idea and mission of our Ministry, based on the 2008 Constitution, is to provide universal health care to the citizens of Ecuador regardless of their background, and that requires high levels of investment if we want to achieve positive and productive results in the short term. Another cornerstone of our work has to do with human capital; a field that the current government has always prioritized. We have doubled the number of professionals working in the Ministry of Public Health, we have increased the salaries of many specialists and health professionals, and we have strengthened the quality control processes for our employees. It is important to recognize their work and role in society, especially in terms of wages. In this context, such changes have attracted back many Ecuadorean specialists and doctors working abroad. In only the first three months of 2013, over 300 health professionals have come back to Ecuador. In addition to that trend, we have experienced an increasing interest from foreign professionals in coming to work in Ecuador.</p><h4>What are the current human capital needs for Ecuador in the health field?</h4><p>We need a qualified work force for the health industry, both nationally and internationally. We welcome all those who want to come back to Ecuador and those who want to come here for the first time, because foreign expertise clearly contributes to the improvement of our professionals and system. However, we do not actively recruit from abroad. We also have strengthened the education programs and financial tools for students to get the best education at the international level, because for many years we lacked the level of graduate students the industry requires. It is all about providing vision and a clear medium-term vision for the development of the public health system.</p><div class="quote">“Our work and projects help to increase the productive working life of our inhabitants and the quality of life."</div><h4>How is the work implemented by your Ministry contributing to the development of Ecuador?</h4><p>Our work and projects help to increase the productive working life of our inhabitants and the quality of life. We provide society with all the health tools and services required at any time during their lives. In addition, we contribute to reduce poverty levels and the living expenses of Ecuadorean citizens, thereby increasing their purchasing power. Finally, we facilitated the coverage and access to treatments and services for all spheres of society when it comes to catastrophic illnesses. We also contributed to higher levels of specialization in both the public and private sectors. For example, in 2012 we increased the number of transplants carried out in Ecuador by 25%, and at the same time we have taken important steps in the prevention and emergency segments of the sector. In fact, Ecuador joined international efforts to help reduce, among other things, smoking levels and implement new vaccinations in order to reduce mortality rates in several segments of society.</p><h4>What is the Ministry's strategy to build closer ties between the public and the private sectors?</h4><p>We think it is very important to build bridges between both sectors, and for example, since 2012, the public sector externalizes some services through the private sector. Therefore, the Ministry also encourages and stimulates the development of the private sector in Ecuador, because that will also drive the development and improvement of the both sectors in terms of quality and service.</p><h4>What kind of relationship does the Ministry have with the Ecuadorean Social Security Institute (IESS)?</h4><p>The IESS is one of the largest providers of public health services. From the Ministry side, we set up policies and strategies for the development of the sector, and we do so working very closely with the IESS, which has played a key role in drawing the future geographical and hospital infrastructure strategy. The main idea behind these collaborative terms is to join efforts to strengthen the public health system in Ecuador. The IESS also purchases some services through us, which at the end of the day increases the availability of financial resources for the public health system. Overall, we can talk about a strong relationship that becomes even stronger and efficient over time, because by uniting forces and efforts we can achieve higher goals.</p><h4>What are some of your main priorities for the public health system over the medium term?</h4><p>We have already achieved important goals in terms of access; we have gone from 16 million health services provided in 2006 to over 40 million in 2012 by restoring the public health system. Starting from 2013, we will implement an accreditation process for our hospitals, which will bring a qualitative change to the system that will complement the quantitative one mentioned above. We need to further increase transparency, efficiency, and quality standards in the public health system.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has TürkTraktör grown and developed in Turkey's agricultural machinery sector since its foundation?</h4><p>TürkTraktör was established 65 years ago as an engine manufacturing company for airplanes, but in 1954 the Turkish government re-established the company as a tractor manufacturer. In 1963, TürkTraktör started manufacturing tractors in Turkey under the Fiat license. The ownership of the company in 1998 was shared between Koç Group and Case New Holland (CNH) Group, a Fiat Group company. Both partners ended up with the same shareholding at 37.5%, the remaining being on the stock exchange since 2004. The decision by Fiat and Koç to invest in Turkey is due to the fact that this is one of the largest markets worldwide for tractors. In fact, it is the fifth largest in the world after India, China, the US, and Pakistan. Until 2008, Fiat and Koç had another venture called Trakmak, which handled local sales and marketing operations for the Turkish domestic market. In 2008, Trakmak and TürkTraktör were merged, making TürkTraktör both responsible for the manufacture and sale of the tractors produced locally, as well as the importation and distribution of tractors and agricultural machinery imported from CNH Group. The locally produced tractor range covers engine sizes from 48 hp to 110 hp, which accounts for 98% of Turkey's domestic tractor demand. TürkTraktör is the longest-serving and most established company, and has a market share exceeding 50%.</p><h4>How does being a larger manufacturer distinguish TürkTraktör?</h4><p>Much like companies within the automotive sector, TürkTraktör manufactures a large portion of its tractor components, which is quite peculiar for Turkish industry. Another advantage is that Turkey has a lower cost of production compared to other countries, thereby making overall prices competitively low. Fiat's agricultural division, CNH, has plants all over the world, and many of them procure parts from Turkey, directly or indirectly. Being able to manufacture in-house presents great advantages in the areas of cost and potential technological development. For example, by controlling the production of engines and drivelines—the most important parts of a tractor—the company is managing the potential for technological innovation while creating product variations to fit market needs. We have five different families of products manufactured at our plant that allow us a wider scope of control and a greater reactivity to changes in demand.</p><div class="quote">“Much like companies within the automotive sector, TürkTraktör manufactures a large portion of its tractor components."</div><h4>To what extent does Turkey's domestic agricultural sector determine the way you design and manufacture your tractors?</h4><p>It does not make much sense to manufacture tractors solely for export. The domestic base's volume of sales is contingent upon levels of investment. It is nice to have CNH Group take over certain parts of our tractors, but this is hardly an issue to the farmer in the field. We send our people to the field and have them watch the production output of our tractors. Turkey is diversified in terms of crops and microclimates. It is a wonderful place to test tractors. Certain parts look like Central Europe in terms of agricultural climate, but, in the southeast, for example, you can grow produce atypical to the region, such as bananas. There are few places of this size where you can have such variety. For this reason, developing a tractor for the Turkish market is the most sensible course of action. In fact, we recently changed the way we developed tractors. We are pushing our R&amp;D department to enlarge our range and offer more. Through the evolution of the regulation in Turkey for tractors, we are reaching a standard that allow us to supply products to Western countries, growing our export business.</p><h4>What is the role of exports in your business, and how do you tailor products to different export markets?</h4><p>Exports have always been one of our focus points. Along with many other firsts in our past, we were the first company in the Turkish automotive sector that exported to the US. We are currently in business with over 90 different countries, which is challenging. This is why it is convenient for us to have CNH Group analyzing customer needs in order to demonstrate to us the nature of the international market. We develop tractors for the Turkish market along standards very similar to those in Europe. Since Turkey adopted European regulations of machinery production—engine emissions, noise, and safety, for example—Turkish tractors are almost aligned with those made in Europe. There is a slight difference in our emission levels that should be solved within the next few years, but we do not have to change noise emissions to send our products to Europe, for example. Other countries have had to change their manufacturing standards prior to export. Tractors in Turkey have been export ready since the beginning.</p><h4>How important are your R&amp;D operations and how would you characterize Turkey as a base for R&amp;D?</h4><p>Typically, tractor groups make either tractors or components. It is quite unusual for a group to create both under the same roof. Because we do this, we act as a center for CNH Group. We are also designing newer generations of engines, as well as tractor cabs. For CNH Group, this is very convenient because it is receiving a genuinely good product from a trusted producer. The R&amp;D potential in Turkey is still young compared to other countries in the world. However, there is a lot of commitment from the government to develop the sector by providing support through incentives and energy. Turkish engineers and developers are very hard working and committed to their projects. You can challenge them to hit certain deadlines and deliver certain targets, and they put a lot of energy into achieving them. We might not have all of the sophisticated, tested methodologies that European countries utilize, but we have a good understanding of technology and speed.</p><h4>As TürkTraktör begins to play a larger role in developing and producing its tractors, what is your outlook for the next decade?</h4><p>We are not only creating more tractors, but more areas of tractor production. As well as producing the engine, transmission, and overall vehicle, we have begun manufacturing axles. We are completely extending our coverage of the tractor as a concept. On top of that, the tractor itself is evolving. We are seeing the varying stages of its evolution in the context of mechanics, hydraulics, and electronic components. We have started including more hydraulics in our transmissions, which offers farmers more comfort. However, at this stage it is not economical to aggressively inject new and sophisticated technology into our tractors. In 10 years, I hope that farmers will be affluent enough to afford newer technology and therefore render them as standard in tractor production. Hopefully, we will be expanding beyond the tractor itself, using technological know-how and manufacturing capacity to produce all angles of a tractor. Through these, we can potentially be more successful than if we were to continue importing parts from other suppliers. This will also help TürkTraktör extend its research in terms of exports and stabilized production.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is Cofetel implementing the national strategy to further develop the telecommunications sector in Mexico?</h4><p>In the past, Mexico lacked public consensus in terms of telecommunications policies, and that negatively affected the development of the sector. However, that recently changed and the authorities have recognized telecommunications as a strategic sector for the development of the country, and the agreement signed in December 2012 under the “Pact for Mexico" (Pacto por México), which includes specific telecommunications commitments, should boost the development of the sector thanks to the consensus of all the parties involved in the political spheres and the sector. Cofetel welcomes such steps because they are much needed. In terms of national projects, the priority is to make the television industry more diverse and competitive, developing more infrastructure and establishing better policies and a legal framework for the telecommunications sector. Fortunately, the change in the national government has not affected our sector's priorities, and therefore our main mission is to make sure that the country achieves the goals set up by the political forces in Mexico. We believe that, thanks to the telecommunications commitments included in the agreement, we reached a very high level of detail in the national priorities and future policies of the sector, and Cofetel believes that it's time to support the national authorities in implementing the numerous projects the agreement established.</p><h4>What are some of the main projects Cofetel will be focusing on looking ahead?</h4><p>We have to separate our projects into two categories: broadcasting and telecommunications. In the latter sphere, we differentiate between infrastructure and regulatory framework projects. In terms of broadcasting, there are several ongoing projects such as the first free-to-air television tendering process in a country with over 200 years of history. We believe it will take about 18 months to complete the entire process, award broadcasting licenses, and see the first programming from these channels. The situation is also similar in radio, and we aim to award over 200 FM renewed broadcasting licenses over the next four years. Finally, in the broadcasting sphere, we are currently dealing with the “digital switchover," and we have an ongoing pilot plan to switch to digital television in Tijuana already. Several border cities will follow Tijuana, and by December 2015 the entire country will have switched to digital television. Such steps are aimed at increasing competition in the industry. Regarding the telecommunications sphere, I emphasize several projects. We are currently working on the adoption of new regulatory policies at all levels. Also, we will continue to pursue policies that benefit the consumer, as we did regarding the interconnection tariffs and mobile telephony services sector, where prices have dropped by around 40% in the last couple of years. In terms of infrastructure, since we are not infrastructure developers, Cofetel will do what it can to contribute to the expansion and development of the national network and its backbone. Finally, we carried out the first extensive spectral report in Mexico in order to evaluate current spectrum usage and free space for new competitors. For example, at the 700 MHz level we need to speed up the switchover process in order to reclaim released spectrum. I would like to stress the fact that these priorities are all well detailed in the Pact for Mexico.</p><div class="quote">“I have no doubt that Mexico soon will be at the same level as the most advanced countries in terms of telecommunications."</div><h4>What measures are you taking to sanction those companies that restrict competition within the industry?</h4><p>Overall, we have to strengthen sanctions against companies that dominate the market, and we are focusing on such elements along with other national institutions like Cofeco, the national competition authority. Regarding current legislation, we believe that Mexico needs to pursue the adoption of restrictions on legal challenges against adopted decisions on behalf of the regulatory body, a very important piece of legislation that has been exemplified in Europe.</p><h4>How sophisticated is Mexico in terms of fiber-optic connectivity?</h4><p>At the moment, Mexico is not very sophisticated in this regard. Ours is a wide and diverse country, where there are geographic markets with a wide range of service providers and high levels of infrastructure. For those markets, competition is clearly benefiting consumers. However, Mexico has another reality, which is that rural areas far from the main urban conglomerates receive little attention from the market. I believe that the government needs to build bridges between our urban markets and rural areas. In this regard, the Ministry has a very ambitious plan to promote the penetration of telecommunications services to Mexico's rural geography. The plan has already been ongoing for the last couple of years, in which the government reached as many as 30,000 rural communities in Mexico, up from the 6,000 recorded in 2010. At the same time, we have midpoint zones, where a high percentage of Mexico's population resides. Cofetel can play a very important role in strengthening market competition and network expansion in these areas. We have to keep in mind that the government must economically commit itself to such projects, because it is easy to talk about investments of around Ps45 billion. That is my only concern at the moment. We need to see the development of the telecommunications sector not only from the commercial and market point of view, but from a social development standpoint as well.</p><h4>How much of Mexico still needs to be updated from analog to digital?</h4><p>In 2011, Mexico's digital television penetration rate stood at 13%, and thanks to a measure we implemented jointly with a number of other national bodies, the rate has risen to 22%. Therefore, digital penetration still remains a major challenge and goal for Mexico in the near future.</p><h4>What is your general outlook for Cofetel and the sector for 2013?</h4><p>It will definitely be a very exciting year at all levels. Cofetel and the industry as a whole have been long awaiting a much-desired political consensus covering all spheres of the sector in a balanced way. The Pact for Mexico ties all of that together. Therefore, I am very optimistic in terms of making the commitments of the agreement a reality, although I know that for the entire process to be completed we need several years because they are long-term projects that require large amounts of investment. Overall, I believe that we will start and finish many projects in 2013, and for that reason, key decisions will be made. I have no doubt that Mexico soon will be at the same level as the most advanced countries in terms of telecommunications. The conditions are given to do so.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In recent years Emirates Steel has committed AED10 billion to a two-phase expansion plan. How has this investment transformed the company?</h4><p>On 26 September 2012, we inaugurated the completion of our AED6 billion ($1.6 billion) Phase 2 expansion program. This Phase increased our total production capacity to 3.5 million metric tons per annum (MTPA). We launched our two-phased expansion program in June 2006, completing Phase 1 in June 2009 at a cost of AED4 billion ($1.1 billion). This has more than doubled our production capacity and made our company the largest integrated steel plant in the UAE, capable of manufacturing raw steel from iron oxide pellets. Our expansion has both directly and indirectly created over 2,000 jobs in the country; in parallel, many high-profile technical job opportunities have opened up for our UAE nationals. Today, we are the leading producer of reinforcing bars (rebar), and we are recognized as one of the foremost wire rod producers in the GCC. Besides our finished rebar and wire rod, we also have the capacity to produce and sell direct reduced iron and steel billets as semi-finished products. More significantly, we are now the sole producer of structural steel in the MENA region.</p><h4>What long-term role can Emirates Steel play in the Etihad Rail network?</h4><p>An MoU was signed with Etihad Rail to use rail as the chief method for raw material and steel transportation in the UAE. This represents a key step toward easing the transportation issues associated with the major flows of Emirates Steel's finished products and raw materials. The partnership will help the company meet the distribution needs of the growing demand for quality steel products from the region's fast-developing economies. By 2016, these raw materials and finished goods flows could reach an estimated annual volume of 12 million tons. By integrating rail in the transport process, considerable savings will be made.</p><div class="quote">“Our domestic market share increased in 2012 to approximately 60%"</div><h4>What is your current production capacity? And what is your current output in MTPA terms?</h4><p>In 2012, we began producing at a capacity of approximately 3.5 million MTPA, following two expansions and the investment of AED10 billion ($2.72 billion). Annually, we produce around 2.1 million tons of 150 mm x 150 mm billets, around 1.9 million tons of 8 mm-40 mm rebar and around 560,000 tons of 5.5 mm-16 mm wire rod. As of the beginning of 2012, we began producing around 1 million tons of structural sections from approximately 200 to 1,016 millimeters in depth.</p><h4>Turkish hegemony over steel rebar production is no longer what it once was. How have Gulf companies such as Emirates Steel been able to increase their share in this market?</h4><p>Emirates Steel has increased its domestic market share to almost 60% and widened its export markets to include Europe, the Americas, the Indian subcontinent, and Asia on top of its traditional markets in the Middle East and North Africa. To maintain its market share at such high levels and lessen the country's reliance on Turkish imports, Emirates Steel asserted its commitment to deliver consistently high-quality products. It also continued manufacturing steel products using state-of-the-art technology and operating with industry best practices in manufacturing. On top of that, it implemented an integrated management system conforming to local and international standards.</p><h4>Last year when Emirates Steel appointed you as CEO, it also appointed its first ever UAE national to the role. How important is Emiratization? And do you think your company has set an important precedent?</h4><p>Emiratization is very important to Emirates Steel. In fact, our responsibilities do not end on the manufacturing side, but transcend that to include the process of training and qualifying our UAE nationals. Considered to be our most important priority, training nationals reflects the Abu Dhabi government's vision to develop our national human capital. Through partnerships with local universities, colleges, and vocational high schools, we contribute to the development of qualified nationals to lead the future of Emirates Steel and the rapidly expanding industries of the country. So far we have succeeded in our Emiratization drive and our rate of nationalization, currently at 19%, stands witness to that. Up from a meager 9% in 2006, we plan to grow the number of UAE nationals within our workforce to reach 30% by 2017. The objective is to equip and empower future generations of nationals with the necessary expertise, competencies, abilities, and drive to develop and support the growth of the UAE industrial sector. Existing employees are provided with a Career Development Plan (CDP), which is a road map for their future target positions. UAE national employees also benefit from study leave programs, which allow both the individual and the company to plan ahead for their personal development.</p><h4>How is Emirates Steel encouraging other Emiratis to enter the workplace?</h4><p>Just like the oil and gas industry, compensation and skill development are two of the most important areas in which we are trying to encourage UAE nationals to join us. We also have many training programs available and joint cooperation with universities. This includes training and intake programs. The steel industry has not been here as long as the oil and gas industry; it is a new industry. There is a lot of potential for UAE nationals to grow, and there are big opportunities for individuals to get good jobs at technical and senior levels. This is also what we are trying to encourage others to do. We believe we have a number of advantages to inspire UAE nationals to come and join us. So far, we have been successful under this initiative and we have more than 400 employees who are Emiratis—the number is an indicator in itself.</p><h4>What countries are you currently exporting to?</h4><p>Our domestic market share increased in 2012 to approximately 60%. This has been achieved through targeted efforts to support key customers and by pursuing sales policies that assist in bringing stability to the local market. Apart from focusing on domestic markets, where we sell nearly 70% of our products, we have exerted sustained efforts in increasing rebar and wire rod exports to regional markets, with a year-on-year increase of 67%, our most significant export markets being the GCC states, followed by Southeast Asia, India, Pakistan, and Iraq, where we sell the remaining 30%. We have the capability to produce and sell a wide range of heavy and jumbo structural sections from 0.2 meters to 1 meter in depth. We anticipate that GCC demand for sections is currently around 1 million MTPA. This market is further expected to grow at 3%-5% per year for the coming decade. A significant proportion of our structural sections will be sold in the GCC market, while the remainder will be exported outside the region to Arab countries, Europe, America, Australasia, the Indian subcontinent, and Asia.</p><h4>What major projects are you currently involved in? What market trends are you noticing in these projects?</h4><p>Emirates Steel looks forward to produce and supply its products to companies involved in nuclear activities. In June 2012, the company was awarded a Quality System Certificate (QSC) as a Material Organization (MO) from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) for the manufacture of concrete rebar. The company was the fourth rebar manufacturer worldwide to be awarded this certificate and the first in the GCC. This is a significant accomplishment for our company, and we expect the nuclear market to be a growing market for the use of rebar. With this issuance of a QSC to our company, we are now well positioned to service that growing market. Emirates Steel's NQS was developed to supply products to nuclear projects and will be activated only for nuclear orders. We have noticed that there is a shift toward infrastructure projects in the UAE. The country therefore continues to enjoy sustained development and accordingly we believe there will be further room for growth in long products, even rebar, which mainly serve construction and infrastructure. On the other hand and in a welcome move by the industry, the government of Abu Dhabi announced this January that it plans to spend AED330 billion on development projects over the next five years. These and other ambitious economic development plans will give a major impetus to the steel sector in the UAE, with projects planned in the construction, railway, and oil and gas sectors set to drive the steel industry's growth.</p><h4>How does Emirates Steel support Abu Dhabi's Economic Vision 2030?</h4><p>The meteoric rise of the company has always been in line with the Abu Dhabi Economic Vision 2030, which maps out the government's long-term plans for the diversification and development of the Emirate's economy. Each step has been made to ensure that we grow in parallel to the sustainable economy of Abu Dhabi, making provisions for global competitors within the Emirate's borders. As such, our ambitions run far and wide to become the leader in our area of expertise and in turn reduce reliance on the world for imports. The main goal behind Emirates Steel being established was to serve the downstream sector. Emirates Steel supports the diversification of the local economy, and wants to help support downstream industries, especially the smaller industries coming from the steel sector. Of course, we want to help create jobs for the UAE nationals, which is one of the main core areas the Abu Dhabi government has chosen to focus on.</p><h4>What is your forecast for 2013?</h4><p>The UAE is a very stable market and the government is injecting money into a lot of big projects. The government's initiatives are going to enhance the economy. Emirates Steel is closely linked to the construction industry, which is performing very well at the moment. This year will be a reflection of 2012. Last year was a mature year in terms of numbers, and 2013 is expected to have a similar reflection. We are fully booked in terms of production and at present we are producing above capacity 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the background of GYİAD?</h4><p>Our organization was founded back in 1986, and we are celebrating its 25th anniversary in 2011. We have somewhere between 450 and 500 members. The importance of the members is very high because they represent $45 billion in terms of the revenue of the companies that they represent. They employ somewhere between 10,000 and 12,000 people in the companies that they own or represent as executives. The interesting side of GYİAD is that our members include shareholders as well as managers. We have bankers representing some of the major banks, including Finans Bank, Akbank, and Garanti Bank. We also have representatives of major holding companies like Borusan Holding and Güral Holding. I can name a lot of others. It's an interesting platform for business managers to get together and discuss the important issues of the country in terms of society, economics, and politics—basically everything that touches the lives of business managers.</p><h4>What issues are of greatest concern?</h4><p>We want stability to continue in terms of politics and economics. Of course, there are some issues that need a lot of government attention. The unemployment rate is still extremely high. A lot of educated people are unemployed. Many people with certificates in hand cannot find good jobs. The country has a high current account deficit, and there is an imbalance between imports and exports. A lot of imports are piling up, and these are assembled in the country and sold externally. A lot of production is based on imported materials. The young population also has issues at hand that we need to solve. Turkey has been successful in fighting inflation. Our leaders are in good health, and the country is still growing fast. There is a lot of attention from foreigners, but we want this to remain stable. We don't like “in and out" investments. Politically the country has been quite stable in recent years since the AK Party came to power in 2002. However, there are economic issues it needs to focus on. Of course, Anatolia is huge and Istanbul is separate. Business people from Istanbul need to focus on the economic issues in Anatolia and this will help with social issues.</p><h4>Can you tell me about some of your initiatives?</h4><p>One of the things that we really want to establish as a culture in Turkey is entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurship is in its infant stages of growth. Neither the education system nor the business world motivate young people enough to set up their own businesses. The financial system doesn't support this either. The venture capital system is very limited. Young people with good ideas need help from the financial world, from NGOs like us, and from the system in terms of taxation. When you set up your own business in this country you're taxed from the first year, and the taxes are very high. The whole climate doesn't help entrepreneurs. We're trying to tackle this problem. In that regard, we started a project called “Golden Bracelets" to help people become entrepreneurs. In this country, vocational training is not up to standard. A lot of people have stressed that Germany's economic success is due to its vocational school system. We started this project to focus not only on the university school system, but also the vocational school system to help people with job skills become entrepreneurs. Turkish Economy Bank (TEB) and its microcredit arrangements have helped with this project to aid young people who would like to set up their own businesses. In addition, when you become an engineer or economist you need to find a job in an established firm. In this country we need investment. The textiles sector has been the main employer for many years. The real value, however, is added when a brand is created. There are very few Turkish brands: Koton and Mavi are good examples, but we need more. We are working to encourage such development.</p><h4>In addition to your role at GYİAD, you are also the founder of GP Trust Financial Management and Services Company, which represents foreigners who are looking to find markets in Turkey. What sectors do your members primarily come from?</h4><p>I mainly work with companies that are in the major retail sectors, such as leather and leather goods, and textile garments. These include some of the major groups out of Europe. On a different note, I work with an environmental group that would like to work in Turkey. There are many environmental issues that are now becoming important in Turkey like carbon emissions, and there is a lot of expertise that is needed.</p><h4>How attractive is Turkey at the moment to investors?</h4><p>Turkey is attractive in the eyes of foreigners because it is a growing country with a young population. It has a lot of needs and consumer demand is high. Everybody wants to be in a growing market. I understand why Europeans want to be a part of the Turkish story, because their economies are at a standstill, if not declining. I'm not so sure how interesting Turkey is in the eyes of its people. However, foreigners are very interested in this dynamic country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Dominican Republic has received over $14 billion in investment in the last seven years. What current economic factors make the Dominican Republic attractive for foreign capital?</h4><p>A sound business climate, political and economic stability, a strategic location, solid legal framework for foreign investment, modern transportation infrastructure, and advanced and reliable telecommunications have been some of the main reasons for the Dominican Republic's success in being recognized as the top recipient of FDI in the Caribbean. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), in 2011 the country accounted for 53.3% of total foreign investment registered in the Caribbean, and was one of the main recipients of foreign capital in Latin America. The remarkable performance of the Dominican economy and the competitive advantages offered by our country for doing business have provided an increased flow of FDI in the productive sectors nationwide. To put this variable into perspective, total FDI received in 2012 amounted to $3.5 billion, representing a record figure for our country. Furthermore, foreign investment has been one of the main driving forces of the Dominican economy in recent years due largely in part to the macroeconomic stability and the positive growth rates that have been sustained, transforming us into one of strongest economies in the Caribbean and one of the most important in the Latin American region. In 2010, the Dominican economy was ranked fifth in overall performance, and according to the ECLAC, one of the least volatile in the region with a 5.9% average GDP growth rate. In 2011, the Dominican Republic grew 4.5%, the same as the regional average, and above the average growth of the world economy (3.9%), according to the IMF.</p><h4>CEI-RD's “Dominicana Exporta" program aims to increase the country's exports to $12 billion by 2013. How is this plan being implemented?</h4><p>For the past eight years, there has been a steady increase in Dominican exports, although progress was briefly interrupted by the global economic crisis that shook the markets in 2008-2009. However, in 2011, the export of Dominican goods reached its highest historical value, amounting to $8.5 billion. Interestingly, the make-up of our product lines has also changed substantially over the years. While sugar represented close to 70% of our foreign earnings three decades ago, nowadays what we call traditional products (sugar, coffee, cocoa, and tobacco leaves) represent only 7%; minerals account for 5%, and 88% of our exports are non-traditional products, including fruits and vegetables, gourmet and organic products, agro-industrial goods, and manufactured items. The Dominican Republic is becoming known for its capacity to produce world-class goods and services. In 2011, we exported more than 3,150 different product lines to over 173 countries around the world. As a policy measure, and following the strategic guidelines of President Medina, CEI-RD aims to support development opportunities for small businesses to boost economic growth and increase exports. CEI-RD focuses on those productive sectors and aims at the internationalization of SMEs, which constitute over 90% of existing companies registered in our country and are also responsible for the creation of more than 1.06 million jobs.</p><div class="quote">“For the past eight years, there has been a steady increase in Dominican exports."</div><h4>What other sectors are you targeting?</h4><p>There are many sectors that have received significant investment from foreign sources in the last six years, such as the transportation sector, which reached FDI totals of $682.5 million, the financial sector, with a value of $642.8 million, and free zones, which received over $487 million. In 2006, there were only 12 companies that had a total of 4,543 agents and 3,800 seats. Currently, it has been estimated that there are between 30,000 and 33,000 agents employed in the industry and an approximately 27,400 seats. The projections are that the sector will grow by over 80% in the next five years, anticipating that more than 60,000 agents will be employed in the industry by 2016.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What could be done to further develop the UAE's accounting standards and requirements for auditing practices?</h4><p>Presently, the commercial company law does not specify the accounting standards framework for financial statements. The Central Bank of the UAE made it mandatory for the banks to prepare financial statements as per International Financial Reporting Standards</p><p>(IFRS). The important thing here, really, is that the commercial company law is under an amendment process and the laws should take into account the requirements of the financial statements and framework of the IFRS. We believe the amended law will also ensure that audits are done in compliance with IFRS.</p><div class="quote">“The reform of insolvency laws can improve economic deficiencies and strengthen the market in times of crisis."</div><h4>What kind of impact did the financial crisis have on internal auditing and risk management procedures?</h4><p>In terms of business challenges, the reforms to the legal framework improved corporate governance requirements for risk management and, hence, the development and resilience of the economy. They proved how important corporate governance is. For a global economic crisis, which it was, the need for stronger internal audit and risk management procedures are of upmost importance. Good corporate governance is a key factor in sustaining economic growth and development. As economic conditions change, so too do risk management priorities. That is also why auditors should consider first and foremost whether they are aligned with the strategy and direction of the company. By focusing on a company's long-term strategy and understanding the impact of short-term initiatives, they can align themselves accordingly and the internal audit functions can be better positioned to monitor and address the risk management activities throughout. Internal auditing plays a very big role in corporate governance. We recommend having an audit committee. Large family businesses should have an audit committee and the chairman should be an independent board member. From there, they can decide whether they should outsource an auditing department or have an internal auditing department.</p><h4>What kind of impact has real estate legislation had on the market here?</h4><p>The Dubai Jointly Owned Property Law established a framework for development and subdivision in such unified compounds, which are then known as jointly owned properties. Each development in Dubai comprises not only a number of units, but also common parts designed for common use by unit owners and occupants. Regulations have been introduced to enforce the law and, among other things, they provide that the owners' association of all the unit owners is responsible for the management, operation, and maintenance of common areas. For each development, the developer must file a Jointly Owned Property Declaration (JOPD) with the Land Department. Under the strata law, they must appoint an auditor and at the first annual general meeting and at the end of the financial year they evaluate financial statements. We give guidance and provide a way forward to the board in the initial transition stage for it to ensure that the service charge is properly calculated, computed, and charged correctly to the owners. When there are multiple users, making sure the right amounts are charged is very important, especially where developers are still holding something they've not sold. It was quite a task in the initial years. The strata law accounts for this and provides owners' associations with the power to hold a loan on the property of those we have not paid. The legalities are there and the lawyers are comfortable going to court to get a loan to recover service charges, which is the same as in other places where we do work, such as the UK.</p><h4>What about the need to improve insolvency laws?</h4><p>That, to me, is crucial in a developing nation. The reform of insolvency laws can improve economic deficiencies and strengthen the market in times of crisis. Reforming the insolvency laws to provide clarity and transparency will boost the national economy by reducing the cost of capital for companies in the medium to long term. There is a bankruptcy law that exists, but it has not been tested by companies, which means that there is uncertainty in legal circles. Best practice corporate governance can play an important role in stimulating investments in the UAE and enhancing confidence in investors. To me, insolvency laws must be a key factor among other key concerns.</p><h4>Why has the bankruptcy law taken so long? Is that prudent?</h4><p>Dubai is unique. It has grown very successfully in a very short period. There is lovely infrastructure and it is taking its time. It has to balance between the sharia and other legal systems. It is complicated. The lawyers and the businesses have long been calling for changes to mitigate financial problems and attract foreign investments. The good thing is that a draft bankruptcy law designed to support companies is currently being reviewed. This is the final stage. There is new hope for an overhaul in how the law deals with businesses and individuals. This is important. We can see goodness coming out of that.</p><h4>Why do you see Dubai as such a vibrant center for global business?</h4><p>Dubai is one of the very few cities in the world that has undergone such a rapid transformation from humble beginnings to be one of the fastest growing cities in the world. Tourism, trade, and logistics have earned it the reputation of being the bridge between East and West. It is a new, dynamic place for the Arabian Gulf region. It is home to maybe 200 nationalities. This is where Dubai is, and it has a lot of offer. It is safe, stable, centrally located, and there is a good education system, health care, and infrastructure. It is always sunny. Obviously, also, the tax legislation is very relaxed. To us, we believe Dubai is the destination of the 21st century. Dubai is ambitious and fast growing.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Between January and November 2011, Colombian exports to Uruguay registered an 18% increase ($18 million) compared to the previous year. How do you assess the economic relations between both countries?</h4><p>Colombia and Uruguay must deepen their economic relations, which have been historically reduced. For example, Uruguay doesn't buy oil or coffee from Colombia, and Colombia doesn't buy meat from Uruguay, and we are in a very specific moment for the expansion of world trade. The emergence of the Asian giants and the financial economic crisis that has affected industrialized countries created a handful of opportunities for our countries, which have seen sustained growth in the price of commodities. We must make the most of the juncture to diversify our exports not only in terms of markets, but also in terms of products. We can't repeat the same mistakes from the past and limit ourselves to being providers of raw materials. We must incorporate the labor of our people into what we export. For that to happen, we need to encourage commercial exchange between countries in the region.</p><h4>What areas of bilateral trade have the most potential for growth?</h4><p>Mercosur and the Andean countries signed an agreement at the Asociación Latinoamericana de Integración (ALADI) congress in 2004. That agreement can and must be deepened by Colombia and Uruguay in terms of bilateral relations. Any agreement that we subscribe to should cover not only the exchange of material goods, but also services and investments. The two countries can complement each other in several areas. Uruguay has received a great deal of FDI in the last few years, quintupling in the last seven years and going from levels close to $330 million to over $2 billion. This process has been accentuated in the last few years, among others, through the attractive regime of investment promotion that Uruguay has, and the installation of some foreign investments of great importance. Since 2010, Colombian investment has been registered in Uruguay, and Uruguayan in Colombia, however shyly. These issues must definitely be part of the new negotiations to increase the exchange possibilities between our two countries.</p><h4>What are Uruguay's priorities in the region?</h4><p>The countries in the region need more than ever to join in and share a common voice in the world today, overcoming the natural weakness of our small states. The world of today is based on the interaction of big blocs and the region must act as such. We live on a continent that probably has the most natural reserves, especially in terms of food, but at the same time, it is still the most unjust place to live. The Latin American countries must join together to enforce fairness and equality. We also need to join our efforts to protect these reserves, which are coveted outside the region. These are Uruguay's priorities: economic development hand-in-hand with equality, the integration of the underprivileged into social life, a secured international voice, the protection of our rights and natural resources, access to advanced technology, and the development of markets for production. For the same reasons, we insist that we must deepen the integration between our countries.</p><h4>Uruguay has the presidency of Mercosur for the first half of 2013. What have been the benefits of being a permanent member of Mercosur and why do you believe Mercosur should merge with Unasur?</h4><p>Unasur is a response from South American countries to the needs of integration. It was born from the urgent need to attend to topics that should not be postponed and that can't be resolved by countries in isolation: energy, road infrastructure, the fight against drug trafficking, and defense, to name a few. At the same time, it has played a key role in the resolution of political crises inside some countries and problems raised between them. In the case of Venezuela and Colombia, the role played by the then Secretary of Unasur, Néstor Kirchner, was very important. Unasur emerged also from the convergence of the deepest integrated processes that maintain their validity: the Andean Pact and Mercosur. Unasur encompasses the 12 countries of South America. It is a political arena and more ambitious in the long term, but it is also less deep in terms of economic integration. Unasur emerged clearly from the necessity to develop maximum unity, respecting the diversity in all of its member states. The different processes of cooperation and integration between our countries sometimes overlap. I understand that their existence responds to realities that must be taken into account. Uruguay is working to integrate ALADI, Mercosur, Unasur, and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC). It is an association of the Andean Pact and Caricom. Regional integration is a priority for my government.</p><h4>What is the significance of Colombia's current peace process?</h4><p>The war in Colombia has been ongoing for over 50 years, with a shocking number of deaths, and injured and displaced persons. The current dialogue process between the government of Colombia and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), with the objective of achieving a long-lasting peace, has opened hope for the Colombian people and for all who have solidarity with them. The political courage demonstrated by President Santos is admirable, as he is working to find a path to peace in Colombia. We fully identify with the objective of leaving behind a long history of war. For that, greatness, maturity, tolerance, and burying feelings of revenge are necessary. On this path, we humbly offer our help.</p><div class="quote">“The countries in the region need more than ever to join in and share a common voice in the world today."</div><p>© The Business Year - March 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What led to you establishing Uribe &amp; Schwarzkopf in Ecuador, and how has the company evolved since?</h4><p>The company started in 1973. We are in a business that is very dynamic; the market and our targets change constantly. It's been changing from housing to rental and commercial projects. It is very difficult to say what our core business was 40 years ago compared to now. Currently, our position is that we are a housing company. Our main business is to build residential projects. We have a specific target in the market and we are always going after that. We also do housing projects; not individual houses, but housing urbanization. We also build many commercial buildings, and we recently built our first shopping mall. In addition, we have built and managed hotels. Uribe &amp; Schwarzkopf's main focus is on housing, and it is expanding in Quito and the surrounding areas.</p><h4>Who do you define as your target market?</h4><p>It is an open target. We aim for the middle and upper class. We like to work very closely with the banks and the social security organizations since they provide most of the mortgages. We are always doing projects that fit their financial products. Our main sales come with mortgages, and 70% of the people that buy from the company use mortgages to finance their purchases.</p><div class="quote">“Our main competitive advantage is our brand. Uribe &amp; Schwarzkopf has never been late on a project."</div><h4>What projects is the company working on at the moment?</h4><p>Right now, Uribe &amp; Schwarzkopf is working on 21 important projects. One of our large projects is in Paseo San Francisco, which is very close to finishing. It is a different concept. It is not a traditional shopping center; it is an entertainment and education plaza. We are also working on two projects in Catalina Aldaz with three buildings each. We are additionally constructing some buildings on the Av. República de El Salvador. We are starting a new project there called HE, which will be a large building in an excellent location of the city. It is going to be a housing project with luxury apartments. We are also starting work on a large office complex on Av. Naciones Unidas, which is a very important location and building for the architecture of the city. It is going to be the best office building in the country. It will incorporate the highest security and technology specifications, and companies are already signing up for the project. We have another project we are planning in Cumbayá. That is our business and we have to keep looking for new land and opportunities.</p><h4>What are your main competitive advantages?</h4><p>Our main competitive advantage is our brand. Uribe &amp; Schwarzkopf has never been late on a project. The maximum was two or three months, which is normal for a large residential project. Over 30% of our clientele come back to buy another unit from us. We have an excellent customer support team that helps consolidate our brand and gives value-added services that are better than our competition. Another thing is that we do everything in-house here, such as our architecture, sales, building, marketing, and mortgages. We provide many services to our clients based on their financial situation. If you want to apply for a loan from social security, we help you do it. We have a credit department here that helps you take out a loan. We also have an internal legal company so that all the paperwork and contracts can be officiated here. It is like a one-stop shop. At the moment, we don't have our own interior design section, but I want to have one. Right now, there is a lot of competition in the country. The last two or three years have been very good because of the money that the banks and social security organizations have been lending; it is like a pump for the business and now the market is steady and growing. The middle class is growing because they have access to credit, and the first thing they do is buy a house or property. The price of land has increased, and so has the price of commodities. The price of prime land has risen two fold in just a year. Also, the final price of housing for the customer has gone up in some sectors; not as much as we would like, but in some sectors it has gone up 15%-20% a year.</p><h4>There are many people trading between Guayaquil and Quito. Do you see this as a big opportunity?</h4><p>Yes, it is, and we are aiming projects at investors. I can see now that people have liquidity, and they have a mind to invest. Many clients come to buy units for rent and that has been a good business for them. We are targeting projects at those kinds of clients from all over the country, not only in Quito. It is always going to be a good investment and the prices are going to go up. Quito is still the cheapest capital in South America for real estate. That is a good thing about our business—it never had a boom. It has gone up step by step, which is good because there is no speculation or false business going around. In regards to office projects, we conducted a study and found there was a lack of quality space available. The growth of the country is attracting more projects from mining companies. Everybody is going to start looking for offices.</p><h4>What are your investment goals for this year?</h4><p>We sell around 1,000 units annually. In terms of investment, projects are getting bigger all the time. We require more partners, more lines of credit, and more labor. In 2012, we had an average of 3,000 laborers working every month. That is a lot of people if you multiply it out. It is important for the economy, not only us. In total there are 1.8 million laborers working in the construction industry in the country at the moment. That is a huge number, and it is important to keep that business going.</p><h4>What are your plans for the short to medium term?</h4><p>We are planning a huge project that is going to be the biggest we have ever built, Ciudad Del Sol. It will contain one of the tallest buildings in Ecuador. It will have a hospital, hotels, commercial space, and residential areas. It is a dream project for everybody in this business. It will probably start in 2014 because we need to plan it carefully and budget it right to start selling the units. It will probably take six to eight years to build. You will belong to a city within a city, and that is the concept we are trying to sell. It is located in a prime location. Before this, the biggest project we did was Parque Real, which was a residential project consisting of 15 buildings that we finished in 2012. It took us eight years to finish. It has two buildings of suites, one office building, and 12 residential buildings. It was the biggest project up until Ciudad Del Sol, which is a different concept because that is more like a city within a city.</p><h4>How do you promote the company and get involved in your work?</h4><p>We have always innovated in our projects. We change the architecture and always offer different ideas or services inside a building for our clients. For example, we are introducing small movie theaters, spas, or gyms inside our buildings. We do something better each time and we innovate. That is the key; being different from the competition. If you buy from us you have something different. We have a good history in building, as well as always having good value in our properties and maintaining their value over time, which is very important for our repeat clients. We try to maintain that for the future so our buildings sell well. Our target market is the first-time buyer and real estate investors. Our vision is to always try and maintain our buildings at the highest standards. Our buildings have our logo on the outside and they are well maintained.</p><h4>How would you rate Ecuador's human capital?</h4><p>Our company has been here for 40 years and the majority of our employees have been here for over 20 years. We have very steady human capital here and very low staff turnover. We offer internship opportunities for young people because we need new innovations, and young architects come with new ideas.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the real estate sector?</h4><p>The government has always been supportive by trying to promote our industry. People are starting to invest in the country and in the city. They are buying cars, houses, and apartments. The money stays here in the country and that promotes growth here for the banks. Local investments are up. People are now more likely to be buying as an investment nowadays. A lot of people want to buy to have a unit in a good location where the rent goes up every year. It is a good investment and that is our key focus right now.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-complete-package]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why do you make 100% Dominican cigars for Davidoff?</h4><p>The Dominican Republic is a country with 500 years of tradition in tobacco production. However, the majority of cigars the Dominican Republic exports are not 100% Dominican. The problem is that this country has made cigars for many years—for centuries even—but never produced the wrapper. The wrapper is a delicate and difficult investment. You need demand in the localmarket to make a 100% Dominican cigar. The Dominican Republic was a very poor country in the 19th century; in that time it didn't have a large enough population to develop an internal market. Typically, to export you need to start with the local market. Then as the demand of the local market increases it also improves quality, and then you create a better wrapper. It's the same in any country. It is why France produces large amounts of wine, because the French consume a lot. The Dominican cigar industry truly began in 1969 because of the free trade zone and the US embargo of Cuba. Production was then transferred from other countries to the Dominican Republic, and there was the possibility to bring all the tobacco and blends of cigars here, as it had the knowledge and tradition. At that time, the Dominican Republic was an exporter of raw materials for cigars. The country uses different types of tobacco from different countries, with different tastes. This is why the Dominican Republic is the number one cigar exporter. There is a cigar for any smoker, and every smoker can find a cigar from the Dominican Republic according to his or her taste.</p><h4>What role does domestic and international demand play in your business activity?</h4><p>For TABADOM, the local market is not important. We only sell cigars to stores that have the conditions to preserve their quality, which sometimes can be a problem because there are not many stores that meet our requirements. In the Dominican Republic our biggest demand comes from tourists, but that is still a small market for us. TABADOM now has a distribution company that sells in the Dominican Republic; however, it is very limited. Our cigars are expensive; not too many people in the Dominican Republic are able to afford them. There are a lot of other factories that produce less expensive cigars, and I think they play an important role in the industry.</p><h4>What markets do you look for outside of the US?</h4><p>The US is the most important market for the Dominican Republic, but not so much for us. Our focus is on the EU, with Switzerland, Germany, and Spain our biggest markets. Duty free sales are also very important to us, especially from Dubai airport.</p><div class="quote">“Over 2013, we are looking to produce 25 million cigars."</div><h4>What are your current production numbers?</h4><p>Over 2013, we are looking to produce 25 million cigars. This is a mix of different brands, with Davidoff making up around one-third.</p><h4>How does this compare to before the global financial crisis?</h4><p>For us it is stable, though in some countries demand has decreased, such as Spain, although in others demand has increased, like in China. The US is a stable market, and so is Switzerland and Germany.</p><h4>What are the current trends in the cigar industry?</h4><p>The strong cigar has a greater advertising appeal; people talk more about stronger cigars. However, the biggest sellers are not the strong cigars. Consumers are very loyal and they don't often look for different experiences. In the US, it's a less mature market. There are more people that like a strong cigar. Something that is clear in the market is that people prefer cigars with a bigger ring gauge and shorter length; this is because people don't have time to smoke anymore, especially because in many countries it's difficult to find a place to smoke</p><h4>What effect could Australia's plain packaging laws have on the global cigar industry?</h4><p>Australia is not an important market because it is very small. However, the problem is the possibility of other countries adopting this type of regulation. We will lose our property rights; the brand name is the most important asset of any company. The law says the packaging has to be a generic design, the boxes are all the same color, all text with the same font, and you can't use the traditional design to draw attention to the brand. The problem will be that consumers will start to buy cheaper cigars because all the boxes are the same, meaning you can't identify new brand names. For that reason, the Dominican government decided to fight this packaging regulation through the World Trade Organization (WTO). The tobacco industry is a very important one for the Dominican Republic. In 2012, the country has earned around $500 million in exports, while the industry employs across the farms, factories, and tobacco processors around 70,000 people.</p><h4>Could you describe what purpose ProCigar serves?</h4><p>ProCigar has brought several Dominican cigar factories together into an association. We are the only organization that has the capacity to engage with people. We have a very good relationship with members of the senate and with the cabinet.</p><h4>How would you assess the government's support for the tobacco industry?</h4><p>The government only supports the tobacco farmers, especially the low-income farmers, because they are the backbone of the entire industry.</p><h4>How will changes to the labor code and tax reforms affect the industry?</h4><p>This will affect us in two ways. The first is the government proposes changes to free trade zone regulations. One is an increase in the sales tax on the local market. However, this is not so important for the tobacco industry. The other is that the government proposes a tax of 10% on dividends, which again is not too important because the majority of the industry doesn't make a profit, meaning there are no dividends to tax. These are not important to us, but it is a change. When companies come to the Dominican Republic it is because they analyze different countries and they decide to come here because of the conditions of the free trade zones; however, if they change the rules, it could affect investment. The Dominican Republic has a big opportunity to increase the production of exports and create more employment. The changes in taxes for business will only raise around $3 million in revenue. It doesn't make sense to risk investment over such an amount. Then the increase in taxes on goods, on products like coffee, petrol, and chocolate makes it harder for the population because of the increase in costs. In addition to the taxes and the reaction of the people, the changes to labor conditions could see strikes across several industries, which will interrupt production. When the people are not happy you cannot make a good product, and this is a bigger problem than the tax reforms. The government should plan additional benefits for the people.</p><h4>What is your forecast for the cigar industry over the next few years?</h4><p>Because of the high price of handmade cigars, we will maintain our market share. However, machine made cigars are in huge demand and that demand is growing every year. Santiago is the number one producer of machine made cigars, and that's a product for the US market. This is good because it increases employment, and also because those types of cigars use the tobacco from poor farmers. For me, this is more important because today the industry is growing too fast; only 15% of the tobacco is Dominican. Much of the cheap tobacco comes from India, Pakistan, or Bangladesh. This is a big opportunity for the Dominican Republic, and this is where the future of tobacco is. While machine made cigars are not our business, it is good for the country.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>To what extent has the rebranding of Barclays Mozambique shaped the bank's current operations, efficiency, modernization, and profitability?</h4><p>The bank's rebranding was the beginning of a new journey for our business as we strive to ensure our alignment with the Barclays greater Africa strategy. The rebranding was characterized by investments in our workforce and systems, as well as a general harmonization within the wider Barclays Group. This rebranding is geared toward an enhanced customer experience with the bank, leveraging the Barclays Group's global credentials, tradition, experience, and expertise to deliver a seamless banking experience.</p><h4>What is the projected impact of Barclays Bank PLC's increased ownership from 55.5% to 63.3% of Barclays Mozambique?</h4><p>The proposed transaction is an important step in realizing our shared goal to become the “go-to" bank in Africa. It also presents a unique opportunity to leverage the integrated combined operations model across the continent, while at the same time enhancing collaboration on product innovation. The transaction is expected to bring about an opportunity for a uniform customer experience across Africa, as we continue to prioritize service quality and the delivery of a broader range of products to customers in all of our chosen markets, including Mozambique.</p><div class="quote">“The SME sector is a growing segment that is becoming increasingly well established locally."</div><h4>Does retail remain Barclays Mozambique's chief focus?</h4><p>Retail has always been and continues to be a fundamental component of our service and product offering, and we are placing even more emphasis on our retail operations in the coming year. In particular, we will focus on our “Prestige" and “Premier" banking products. The bank is also placing additional emphasis on new branch locations, paying close attention to the design and refurbishing of our older branches, coupled with the introduction of alternative delivery channels and improved technology to deliver our products. Additionally, our corporate segment is of fundamental importance, largely due to the significant growth of the Mozambican economy and banking sector. As a financial institution, we aim to cover all of the significant segments that contribute to the economy's growth and subsequently increase our business activity.</p><h4>What is the bank's strategy to increase retail banking and lines of credit products for SMEs?</h4><p>The SME sector is a growing segment that is becoming increasingly well established locally. We are investing in capabilities and competencies in this sector in order to effectively partner with customers and contribute to our clients' development.</p><h4>How would you characterize the bank's position in Mozambique's increasingly competitive financial sector, especially with regard to the corporate segment?</h4><p>Despite the increasing competitiveness of the local financial sector, Barclays still holds a considerable market share and is the fourth largest bank in the country. Barclays is the only bank in the local market with a truly global presence. Our short-term objective is to leverage this experience and capability to further enhance our relationships with multinational customers involved with large coal, oil and gas, and mining projects. We are confident that by being a global player in the market, we can optimize our global resources, develop international experience, and employ the necessary tools to deliver the value-added demanded by our customers. As a financial institution, we intend to get involved in every important project, which will enable us to become the “go-to" bank—not only in Mozambique, but in all of the markets in which we operate. We are improving our system as a way to take advantage of the country's development process and ensure that we capitalize on the ever-increasing number of business opportunities in the country.</p><h4>To what extent is Mozambique a key emerging regional player in the insurance market for international investment?</h4><p>We see Mozambique as an important market for insurance. Current penetration rates are low, and that presents an opportunity as the economy and awareness among potential customers grow. The group acquired a leading insurer, Global Alliance Seguros, in Mozambique in 2011. Together with the banking footprint, this alliance presents an exciting opportunity for the delivery of combined group products and services for our customers.</p><h4>Do Mozambican sovereign bonds present an attractive investment opportunity for both domestic and international investors?</h4><p>The global financial crisis has created an interesting dynamic for first-world governments, which continue to face declining incomes brought on by relatively stagnant or shrinking economies and higher expenditures as they try to keep their social systems and banking systems together. Fortunately for these governments, funding costs have declined materially as investors have sought refuge at the expense of returns. The BRICs (including South Africa) have experienced similar substantial slowdowns as export markets have dried up and commodity prices remain benign. As a result, nominal bond returns have declined and risk has increased, leading investors to accept lower returns and the relative safety of low-yielding debt. Although African economies have suffered in the wake of the global financial crisis, economic growth levels have consistently remained above world averages. The economic growth in a number of African economies relates to rapid population growth, strong infrastructure development, and affordable labor. Ongoing interest demonstrated by global mining and energy giants also continues to be a material growth driver. The relatively mature funding markets, which are offering fairly high returns, have supported and will continue to support this growth. In terms of this trend, Mozambique has been a star performer, registering figures consistently ahead of its peers. Government funds are supplied by inward investment, donor funding, and export proceeds, which up to now has been sufficient. Local funding has been secured through a relatively small bond market. Against the backdrop of the crisis, Mozambican sovereign bonds have presented a secure investment with a decent return for both domestic and international investors. However, the local bond market has a few unique characteristics—currency bonds are in short supply and the secondary market is practically non-existent, and bonds have been issued with maturities of around five years, which may be too long for some foreign investors. The upside is that the bonds always offer a real rate of return regardless of inflation. The Ministry of Finance is considering the possibility of placing more emphasis on the structural management of government finances, fixed-rate issues, and primary dealerships. From our perspective, although yields are relatively low compared to historic levels, Mozambican sovereign bonds offer a strong investment alternative.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the Mozambican economy and what does this signal for the future of Barclays Mozambique?</h4><p>Mozambique is on the cusp of becoming the fastest-growing economy in Africa due to sizeable investment opportunities in natural resources such as gas, coal, agriculture, and fisheries. Barclays remains committed to Mozambique's success, and the bank recently underwent a recapitalization process in order to play a larger role in the country's growth story.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the evolution of Qatar's economic growth?</h4><p>The National Vision 2030 is leading the country on a path of economic diversification. Hospitality is regarded as one of the strategic drivers, and this entails investments in Qatar in addition to investments in tourist areas abroad. Hospitality is part of the infrastructure needed to support the organic development of the country. As for the development of the tourism industry in Qatar, we need facilities and services that go beyond a portfolio of hotels. The opening of the new Hamad International Airport during 2H2013 will reveal a world-class facility that will enhance the passenger experience, whether inbound or in transit. That said, Qatar's infrastructure is developing at a fast pace and, subsequently, the entertainment offer also diversifies every year. From high-end shopping malls and traditional souks, world-class museums and cultural hubs, to parks and unique outdoor recreational facilities alongside an increasing portfolio of hotels and food and beverage concepts, Qatar has something to offer both residents and tourists.</p><h4>The tourism sector is becoming increasingly important in Qatar, with 85,000 new hotel rooms to come on the market by 2022. What role does Katara Hospitality play in these plans?</h4><p>We have been at the forefront of our sector for more than four decades, as pioneers in many areas. Today, in terms of current room supply, Katara Hospitality was ranked the market leader during a recent benchmarking exercise conducted by Ernst &amp; Young. We clearly intend to maintain our leading position by developing world-class hotels that are relevant not only for our portfolio, but emblematic for the country as well. We have recently launched a new project in the Marina District of Lusail city, planning to erect in this meticulously planned urban development as an iconic hospitality complex that is intimately related to the country. With an architectural design inspired by the seal of Qatar, the Iconic Towers in the Marina District are set to become a hospitality landmark for the industry. The crossed swords of the national seal have been architecturally translated into twin arched towers that rise gracefully from the podium level, while the landscaped gardens and the sea promenade symbolize the ocean and the palm trees. This simple yet elegantly shaped complex creates an easily identifiable landmark, recognizable beyond regional borders.  The comple will host a luxurious five-star hotel that will cater to discerning business travelers and a lavish six-star hotel to meet the needs of those seeking sophisticated luxury accommodation, while branded apartments will accommodate permanent residents looking for the utmost comfort. This complex will include a total of 614 units. State-of-the-art entertainment and recreational facilities, including specialized boutiques, VIP movie theaters, exquisite signature restaurants, and a private cigar lounge are to be complemented by exquisite banqueting and conference spaces, as well as office-dedicated areas. Another hotel development is currently under study on a plot of land we acquired in the Foxhills district of Lusail city. In terms of our existing properties in Qatar, many will undergo major renovation works in 2013. Although Katara Hospitality currently focuses on its international expansion, we intend to maintain our position as a market leader in Qatar, while encouraging private investors to participate in building a solid hospitality network in the country.</p><div class="quote">“When engaging into a project, we always look for something special that sets it apart."</div><h4>How would you characterize the five-star sector in Doha?</h4><p>The five-star hotel sector in Qatar showcases a variety of hotel concepts, from hotels that have shaped the hospitality landscape over decades, to new entries that target niche markets. The domestic properties under Katara Hospitality portfolio marked several “firsts" in Qatar: the hotel currently known as Doha Marriott Hotel was the first five-star hotel; the Sheraton Doha was the first internationally branded property; the Ritz-Carlton Doha was the tallest building in Qatar at the time it opened; Sealine Beach Resort was the first leisure destination in the country; and Sharq Village &amp; Spa was the first luxury resort on the market. We will continue to develop hospitality environments that are not only representative for our portfolio, but emblematic for the country as well.</p><h4>What are some of the benefits and challenges of operating in Qatar?</h4><p>Katara Hospitality is primarily an asset manager. However, the development aspect of our business is closely related and interconnected with our core expertise. Many hotels under our portfolio have been developed by Katara Hospitality, from the project stage to becoming a valuable asset, while most of our international properties are currently undergoing major renovation work under our direct supervision. We have always worked closely with international hotel operators and each development was a learning experience for us. This gave us the depth of expertise and confidence to venture into becoming a trusted hotel operator. We identified the growth potential of business tourism in the country and we created the Merweb brand to meet the needs of discerning business travelers. Merwebhotel Al Sadd was the pilot project in the development of the Merweb brand and it opened late 2001. The hotel has received permanent recognition in the market for its services tailored to the needs of business travelers looking for affordable comfort. This year will see the opening of Merwebhotel City Centre. Directly connected to the City Centre shopping mall, the hotel is set to offer 362 units and a complete range of services tailor made to meet the needs of discerning business travelers. From overnight to extended stays, enticing dining options, versatile meeting and banqueting facilities, and also working spaces that go beyond the services of the typical business centre, the Merwebhotel City Centre will definitely bring to the market a successful operating concept.</p><h4>Which markets is Katara Hospitality going to be focusing on in the near future?</h4><p>Katara Hospitality's mixed portfolio ranges from historical palace properties to business and resort hotels—there is no prototype that we look for in an asset before investing in it. Our diversification and expansion strategy involves investing in properties suited to our ethos and style, aligned with the Katara Hospitality brand values, while considering the return the hotel is likely to yield. Katara Hospitality is currently evaluating investment opportunities in business and leisure hotels in Western Europe, North Africa and the Arab Peninsula, as well as Southeast Asia and North America. Furthermore, as an entity owned by the government, we constantly find investment opportunities in emerging markets, following the directions generated by the country's foreign policy in supporting developing economies. By investing in emerging markets, we take the challenge of being pioneers that support the development of the tourism industry in future destinations. Katara Hospitality will introduce the first internationally branded hotel in the Union of Comoros—a project due for completion in 2015—while we recently signed an MoU for investing in a hospitality development in the Republic of the Gambia and for another project in the Maldives. Consequently, through its investment, Katara Hospitality is committed to support local communities by creating employment opportunities and sourcing supplies from local markets, thus contributing to community prosperity.</p><h4>What leads your decisions when planning to acquire a hotel?</h4><p>When engaging into a project, we always look for something special that sets it apart and adds an exceptional dimension to our business, while taking into account the return the hotel is likely to yield. Katara Hospitality does not focus exclusively on acquiring iconic properties. We also create hospitality icons or turn assets that were designed for other purposes into true hospitality gems. A relevant example here is the Tazi Palace in Tangier, which was designed to become a royal residence and was transformed into a luxurious palace hotel.</p><h4>What are the medium-term plans for Katara Hospitality?</h4><p>We are planning to own 30 hotels by 2016 and 30 more by 2030. Katara Hospitality currently owns 26 properties, operational or under development, with 2011-2012 marking an important milestone in the company's development, as we practically doubled our portfolio by acquiring properties in strategic international locations. Our European presence is also strong, and 2013-2014 will see the opening of several iconic properties in key markets. With a solid presence in France, Switzerland, and Italy, we are looking for further investments in key European markets, including the UK, Germany, and Mediterranean countries. We are also considering investments in North America. Furthermore, our aim is to become one of the leading hospitality organizations in the world and the Qatar National Vision 2030 creates the ideal framework for us to achieve this goal. Thus, we believe that doubling our portfolio within the time span of 15 years is also realistic.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As a new addition to the Turkish banking sector, what motivated the Audi Saradar Group to enter the country and how would you characterize the potential of the local market?</h4><p>This is a regional bank and Turkey has always been part of our plan because it is close to each segment in the region: the Middle East, North Africa, Europe, and the South Mediterranean. Economically, it is connected to the Western world as well. It is becoming a very good link between many economic centers. Culturally, politically, and economically, its influence is increasing constantly and in line with world trends. Development in Turkey has taken a significant step, especially in the past 10 years. Entrepreneurship has transformed the market into a well-structured, economically well-run, micro-economically growing, and more internationally aligned mechanism. Turkey is part of the global market, but its domestic market is attractive as well. The country has a large, young population with a very diverse culture. So much is happening in Turkey that makes it a very dynamic and evolving place to do business. Because this is a socially developed economy with an impressive export development industry, its ties with the Middle East, North Africa, Europe, and the West, in general, are increasing. The numbers reveal 20%-30% growth every year in terms of exports and investments as well. In northeast Africa, there has been more investment from Turkish companies in the last five years—not only in the construction industry, but also in factories, highways, bridges, and dams, for example. Inward investment from many countries in the region has also been increasing over the last five years. We have also seen an increase in the number of conferences in the last two or three years, which is driving up the cost of hotel stays. This gives stakeholders an opportunity to explore new business lines. The question for us was never “Why Turkey?" It had always been “Of course Turkey." It was just a matter of when.</p><h4>What strengths does Odeabank bring to the local banking sector?</h4><p>We have the advantage of being new. We can use the best technology, systems, and efficiency in our organization. Large banks usually grow over time, with many of their systems becoming obsolete—they cannot manage high growth because they have to fill a gap by bringing in many new people. When growth slows, they still have to keep the extra people, and it becomes difficult to maintain high efficiency. In our case, because we are a bank established by bankers who have come from other banks, we recognize bottlenecks and understand what can be improved—it makes sense that we started with the most efficient system and the highest technology, which is always very important. We have to sell, but we don't always have to sell face-to-face—we can sell over the internet or through call centers as well. Turkey is developed and fast, which is why it is attractive. We use many of the best automated processes and put some form of creativity into the equation. Maintaining efficient communications between the departments is a very important factor because there are many different people and systems involved. To this end, we are doing some very basic things and also implementing advanced products. We have a group intranet, which is very important as we seek to maintain the overall branding and internal culture of the company. Most institutions don't place too much emphasis on this concept, but as one of the best companies in terms of establishing media, we are working to communicate better. We are progressing and developing every day. From the first day we open a branch, everyone in the company is entitled to see the issues at the branch as well as the procedures and guidelines. Everything is out in the open so that if a newcomer comes in, they can see the whole picture.</p><div class="quote">“This is a regional bank and Turkey has always been part of our plan."</div><h4>How will advanced technology become an element that customers experience?</h4><p>When customers enter our branches, they can investigate our service in the waiting room, type “Odeabank" into Google and explore our products online, or benefit from our online entertainment offerings with their children. Other institutions only provide magazines; we are providing customers online games to play while waiting their turn in line. It is also useful for customers to see their account online and learn about the products that are available to save time before meeting our representatives. Our clients can search for what they need and we can provide it for them. We are trying to make use of technology to be efficient in addition to presenting a positive image for the bank.</p><h4>What does Odeabank have planned for 2013?</h4><p>Our main vision is to open 26 or more branches because we have to expand. The first six branches have demonstrated the ability to attract a large number of customers, and we are very eager to develop demand further. Odeabank is a young bank, and it will take time to absorb and digest every aspect of the market before we begin expanding. Once we recognize the right path, we will continue steadily. Moreover, our products are going to undergo significant evolution and growth in 2013. For example, the infrastructure behind credit cards is being developed and we hope to allow their usage at multiple ATMs in the coming year. We have to do in months what other banks have achieved in years. Furthermore, the bank is actively working on branding. In 1Q2013, we plan to offer a variety of different credit cards. Apart from that, we will be receiving and processing applications from other investment banks.</p><h4>How would you characterize the outlook for Turkish banking and how does Odeabank's long-term vision fit into the future of the sector?</h4><p>In Turkish banking, the local banks dominate the scene. This is also common in many other countries. Unlike consumer groups, banking is more sophisticated and geared more toward service and penetration in the market. I do not believe that any of Turkey's top four banks will be sold in the short term, and thus we are not aiming for the top four or five places. The state banks will not be changing hands, but the banks ranking below them are all multinationals. Some of them will stay here, and some might chose to leave if the shareholders change. There are many other smaller local Turkish banks, and we foresee some consolidation. Due to the economic fundamentals in Turkey, there will be continuous interest in buying mid-market banks, so there may be changing shareholder structures among the secondary banks; there will be more activity in that segment. The speed and health of banks similar to ours will also be changing, but we are not going to see the market evolve significantly. We are aiming for a 2% or 3% market share, and all of the banks will grow and have room to do so in the coming years. The expected growth rate is approximately 20% for the Turkish banking system, against a 11% nominal growth and 4.6% real growth in the overall economy in 2013.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Emirates Aluminium (EMAL), a joint venture between DUBAL and Mubadala Development Company, is the anchor tenant at Khalifa Industrial Zone Abu Dhabi (KIZAD). What is the size of your facility and what are your current production numbers?</h4><p>EMAL is a 50-50 joint venture between the Mubadala Development Company and Dubai Aluminium (DUBAL). EMAL currently supplies customers around the globe with high-quality, ISO9001 certified aluminum that is available as sow, standard ingots, sheet ingots, foundry ingots, and extrusion billets. The sow and standard ingots are traded on the London Metal Exchange. In 2013, EMAL started producing 800,000 metric tons of aluminum annually, after successfully achieving an amperage increase from 350 kA to 380 kA into each single pot, leading to an additional 50,000 tons annually. In 2014, and after the expansion is complete, EMAL will be producing a total of 1.3 million metric tons of aluminum per year. As a world-leading company operating in a global market, EMAL is set to meet the growing demand for aluminum.</p><h4>EMAL is nearing completion of its $4.5 billion Phase II expansion, which will make the facility one of the largest smelters in world. What is your outlook for its completion?</h4><p>Phase I was completed on budget and ahead of schedule and our Phase II development is already 40% complete, on-track, and on budget, with milestone achievements including power plant equipment delivery, first pot cell concrete pouring, and first steel structure already complete. Our Phase II expansion will consist of an additional 444 reduction cells and the introduction of the upgraded DX+ Reduction Cell Technology, a DUBAL-developed technology that enables aluminum to be produced using less energy without compromising quality. Once completed, the potline will be the longest single potline in the world at 1.7 kilometers. As well as an increase in capacity, our Phase II plans will also focus on providing greater product flexibility. Our ISO 9001 certified casthouse will increase from six to nine casting centers, enabling us to respond to changing market demands and accommodate our customers' specific requirements. This will provide a significant advantage in today's highly competitive aluminum market.</p><div class="quote">“The GCC is a growing market and the region enjoys many factors that make it highly competitive."</div><h4>How will this project impact the Gulf region's aluminum industry and its position in the global market?</h4><p>The majority of EMAL's aluminum production is targeted toward our growing international customer base. Our focus is on markets in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and the US. Asia remains a strategically important market for EMAL, with almost one-third of the company's exports targeting the Far East, excluding China. Sales are set to grow in both Europe and North America in 2013. Europe in particular will see a significant rise in sales. In 2011, sales output in Europe represented 23% of EMAL's total sales. We forecast that in 2013 this figure will increase to 35%. EMAL is highly optimistic in its belief in the future of aluminum both within the GCC and globally. World aluminum demand is forecast to increase by 6% year-on-year over the next decade. Current annual demand for aluminum is 40 million tons, and this is estimated to reach over 70 million tons by the year 2020. Almost 80% of the aluminum produced in the Gulf is exported to different parts of the world, firmly placing the region in a prominent position to meet both local and world demand. With production expected to increase from the current 800,000 tons to 1.3 million tons in less than three years, EMAL is well placed to meet this growing demand.</p><h4>What will be the size of your workforce once the expansion is completed?</h4><p>EMAL currently employs 2,000 people, which will rise to 3,000 when Phase II is completed in 2014. EMAL has a strong Emiratization program, which includes guaranteed employment after the successful completion of our Pre-Employment Courses (PECs) covering all aspects of work at the industrial flagship, university scholarships for local students in appropriate disciplines, and a summer training program for local high school students. In addition, EMAL maintains a strong presence at all local recruitment fairs.</p><h4>Aluminum exports from the UAE showed a year-on-year increase of 102% in 1H2012. What factors are driving this growth?</h4><p>The GCC is a growing market and the region enjoys many factors that make it highly competitive. The region benefits from low business costs, and the UAE is on the lowest part of the cost curve. Specifically in Abu Dhabi, international investments are welcomed, and EMAL itself has been built within the confines of KIZAD, one of the largest industrial zones in the world, providing opportunities for aluminum downstreaming.</p><h4>EMAL will host the Middle East's premier aluminum event in November. Why is the Arab International Aluminum Conference (ARABAL) so important?</h4><p>Last year and for the first time, three of the industry's major events were hosted at the same time and in the same place; Abu Dhabi. It was the perfect opportunity to showcase exactly why it is the place to be and EMAL is very proud to announce this year that it's hosting ARABAL 2013 in November. ARABAL is a leading trade event, specifically designated for the Middle East's aluminum industry, and it is attended by all primary aluminum producers in the Arab world, which makes it the conference of choice for anyone interested in the Middle East's aluminum industry.</p><h4>Sheikh Ahmed has said the UAE's economy will grow by 3.8% in 2013. What is your forecast for EMAL?</h4><p>Over recent years EMAL has positioned itself as a reliable supplier of quality metal to the world. Rising from the bare desert sands of Abu Dhabi, the company has invested heavily in the latest technologies to create a state-of-the art aluminum smelter ready to compete with the best in the global market. The leaders of the UAE identified aluminum as the product of the future as part of its vision for creating an economy beyond oil and gas. EMAL was created as one of the leaders in industrial diversification in Abu Dhabi and helps grow the international profile of Abu Dhabi as a place to do business. EMAL is already contributing 0.4% of the UAE's GDP and providing job opportunities for Emiratis.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>When is Fruta del Norte going to enter into production?</h4><p>Fruta del Norte is a mineral deposit that has fantastic potential for Ecuador. It is expected to be the first major large-scale underground gold mine in the country's history. In order to actually put the mine into production, we have to go through a number of steps, including signing a contract with the government of Ecuador. Apart from that, there are a lot of technical studies, environmental studies, and permits of a wide range in nature that we need to obtain to move the project into the production stage.</p><h4>What has been the contribution of investments by Kinross in Ecuador?</h4><p>We have been here almost 10 years. Mining has the curious characteristic that it takes a very long time from when you start exploring to putting it into production. Since 2003, we have explored a large area in the southeast of Ecuador, and in 2006 we found a gold and silver deposit—Fruta del Norte. The deposit is about 200 meters below ground. It is a very high-grade deposit of gold and silver. In a mine, the grade is rated on how many grams of gold you have in every ton of rock. There are many mines around the world now, such as in Chile and the US, for example. Usually those mines have a grade of about 1 gram for every ton of rock. Fruta del Norte has an average grade of approximately 8 grams per ton, which is very high. That is one of the reasons why this deposit is so important. Right now, we have reserves in Fruta del Norte defined at almost 7 million ounces of gold and almost the same amount in silver. Once we discovered the ore deposit, we knew it was big, but we didn't know how big. We needed to find out, so we started drilling. Every time you drill you get a lot of information that can be used to see how much gold is in the drill sample. We have enough information now to go ahead and present a technical feasibility study to the government, which is expected to be enough information to sign a contract. The studies will continue in parallel so that when we start building the mine, we have all the information in place. It is a very complex business to build an underground mine.</p><div class="quote">“We produce around 900,000 ounces of gold every year in South America, making it a very important region for us on a global basis."</div><h4>What is the investment blend in the country?</h4><p>Right now, we have invested almost $300 million. However, from here on, to build the mine and get it into production, it is going to require more than $1 billion. We don't have all the information, but it is a huge project. Our key business objective is to get everything signed in 2013. We started negotiations for the exploitation contract in early 2011. This is the first major contract between Ecuador and a major Western mining company, so there are a lot of issues that need to be worked out. Negotiations go through cycles where things are going well, and then you hit a roadblock, work through it, and keep advancing. It has been difficult, but a transparent and honest process and we now have a very short list of issues left to work out. The biggest issue is the windfall profit tax. That is part of the tax legislation here in Ecuador, and it is calculated on a 70/30 basis. That is a very tough tax for the mining business because it is based on revenues, and it gives you no protection from rising costs. Normally, when the gold price goes up, costs go up as well. When that tax kicks in, the government takes its 70%, but most of the 30% for the mining companies is taken away by rising costs. It is a distortion of tax in favor of the government, and it leaves the industry with very little. We want to fix this by changing to a profit-based tax. That means that if we have a good year, we pay the tax, but if we have a bad year, we don't pay the tax. We should share the risk more equally. In this regard, the government has offered publically to make some reforms to the mining and tax law. These reforms could provide greater legal security to foreign investors, who are always looking for clarity in the rules and stability due to the huge investments they are making.</p><h4>What is the relevance of Ecuador to the global operations of Kinross?</h4><p>Kinross has mines in many parts of the world. We have mines in South America, North America, Central Asia, and Africa. Right now, South America represents about 36% of our global gold production from our mines in Brazil and Chile. We produce around 900,000 ounces of gold every year in South America, making it a very important region for us on a global basis. When you add in the potential production from our project in Ecuador, that makes South America even more important for us. Fruta del Norte is a mine that could be producing for 20 years or more. When you see that kind of long-term production of a very high-quality ore deposit, it means Ecuador is important for Kinross.</p><h4>What does Kinross do to help the local communities?</h4><p>We have worked with the local communities for a long time. The key fundamental objective is to always have a relationship based on trust and transparency. As part of the relationship, we have developed a very clear, long-term community investment strategy. It is the people of the parish, not us, that say how they want to develop their community over the next five to 10 years. Right now, the region that hosts us in Ecuador is one of the poorest in the country, making our development priorities revolve around good planning execution: building better schools, clean water supplies, stable electricity, and better roads. There is a lot of basic infrastructure that cities take for granted, which the villagers don't have. We help them develop this project and then the plans are implemented. We wanted to get away from the old model where the company was very paternalistic. We are part of the community and we need to contribute in a responsible way to long-term development, but it is their plan, not ours. It is a very constructive way to have the relationship. We have completed many projects on a participatory basis, as letting the community take the lead fosters ownership and accountability. We have had a lot of fantastic experiences, and we have some excellent infrastructure and education projects on the go. For example, an important part of our commitment is to favor local employment. However, generally speaking, the education level in the area is quite low. Our message is that we will help these people finish high school. Nowadays, mining is very hi-tech. It is about managing computers and technology; you need a high level of mathematics, and you need to be able to read and write. There have been amazing stories of people in the communities in their 40s and 50s who get up early to do their farming, then go and study. The commitment and motivation of these people is amazing because they see a better future.</p><h4>Can you tell me about your project with plans for a university?</h4><p>Originally, we were planning to build a training center because people need to be trained on how to use mining equipment. As time went on, we had meetings with the Ministry for Coordination of Human Talent and Coordination, and the Minister explained to us that it has a mission to build universities in the Amazon region of Ecuador where we are located. The Ministry wants to build a university halfway between our project and another large project that is being developed by the Chinese. The Minister asked us to sign an agreement to give the Ministry the design of our training center, and the government would build it. We thought it was fantastic to work together. Whenever possible, we want to support government programs rather than being an independent force because we are contributing in a more sustainable way to the long-term development of the country. We signed that agreement not long ago, and we have already delivered on our first commitment to provide the studies and architectural plans for our training center. Eventually, people will be trained in this new university training center that was partly designed by our team. Finding qualified workers is expected to be a huge challenge, and Fruta del Norte is going to need 1,000 people to operate. For every direct employee, the average rule is that there are between two and three indirect employees. There will be a whole network of suppliers and providers around the mining projects. There is high-tech equipment, which will require maintenance and deliveries. The great thing about mines is that since there are so many people living and working there every day, they all need support. There is an amazing network of suppliers and support around these projects. There are several mining projects nearby, so this whole area is going to develop over time.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Mexicans have a legacy that is pre-Hispanic, colonial, independent, democratic, and revolutionary. The past for us has been our identity and a source of inspiration, and so it will remain in my government. We are heirs to an ancient tradition that survives today in indigenous languages and cultures. We are the expression of the Hispanic culture. Our institutional vocation is a fact proven by history. Very few countries, not only in Latin America but worldwide, have had our continuity, since 1934, in witnessing the swearing in of a new President every six years.</p><p>During these years, the country has maintained internal political order. Mexico has progressed without dictatorship, which was the aim of our revolution. Full democracy has taken time, but today democracy has been consolidated and become part of our culture. Generations of women, men, thinkers, politicians, activists, and citizens have worked to make the democratic Mexico of today. In Mexico, there is a real separation of powers and there exists a healthy plurality of parties in Congress. Federalism in Mexico is not an ideal, but a reality.</p><div class="quote">“Mexico is commencing a new stage of democratic life."</div><p>These achievements have included bringing macroeconomic stability to the country over the past three decades. After surviving a number of successive financial crises, Mexicans have learned hard lessons. It is now up to us to use this platform to accelerate growth. We have an historic opportunity to project Mexico to the world, for it to become the economic powerhouse that it deserves to be.</p><p>We currently have a clear picture of what Mexico needs to sustainably accelerate its development and economic growth so that it is able to realize the huge potential it has in both natural, and, more importantly, human resources.</p><p>We also need to rediscover ourselves and our strengths. We are living in a new political climate, which fortunately for Mexico allows for different visions. This climate helps us to reach agreements that allow us to move toward better conditions, especially in terms of transforming our legal codes and institutions so that they are more in line with the social and political realities of today.</p><p>Mexico today has a number of strengths, including a high level of macroeconomic stability and low debt. This puts it above many countries and gives us the confidence to move forward and a mandate to use our wealth for the benefit of all Mexico. At the same time we have a clear diagnosis, too, of what we have to change. That is the challenge for this government.</p><p>We want a Mexico that is free of violence, a Mexico of peace and tranquility for all Mexicans. We want an inclusive Mexico and a Mexico that recognizes the importance of quality of education, because education sustains and supports the development of any nation.</p><p>In order to accomplish this, we must grow at an even faster rate. This is the aim of a government-wide effort to give more credit to productive projects, to develop more competitive industrial policies, and to create more jobs and opportunities for Mexicans. I am convinced that if we achieve these objectives, Mexico will assume a greater role in the world, able to support and defend the noblest causes that humanity has.</p><p>Our vision for Mexico is to never become complacent. We must harness the current spirit of change and transformation and engage all sectors of society and the economy to forge a new future for the nation. As President of Mexico, I call on everyone without distinction of party, social standing, or ideology in order to reach shared goals. This is precisely what has been proposed by the Pact for Mexico. Because reform cannot succeed without the support of a large majority, we are laying at the foundations of this a level of political agreement and dialogue that allows for democracy, economic growth, and the reduction of poverty and social inequality.</p><p>Mexico is commencing a new stage of democratic life. Now is the time to come together and take the next step in improving our democracy. In this way, policy makers should, or must, walk together. We need dialogue to build consensus. This decisive moment in the life of our Republic requires politicians to reach agreement. It is a great display of political maturity that the political parties in Mexico have come together to sign the Pact for Mexico.</p><p>The Pact includes five essential agreements for our national life. Firstly, to transform Mexico into a society of rights, so that all Mexicans can exercise the rights set out in our Constitution. Secondly, to promote economic growth, employment and competitiveness, to create conditions that allow Mexico to grow to its true potential. Thirdly, to foster security and justice, in order to realize the desire and right of Mexicans to live in an environment of peace and tranquility. Fourthly, to increase transparency, accountability, and anti-corruption measures. Finally, to perfect conditions for democratic governance.</p><p>Based on these five major agreements, we, as political actors, have managed to lay the foundations of a consensus aimed at jointly improving our country. The signing of the Pact for Mexico shows that we can agree. It is unequivocal proof that with political will and a shared vision of the future, the transformation of our country will be possible. Beyond good intentions, this is a visionary initiative that will allow us to build a future based on the shared goals of various political expressions. It is an innovative agreement that imposes specific goals and deadlines to achieve them. It is also a realistic agreement, detailing practical tools to carry out the aims within a realm of clear facts. The Pact does not replace or limit the legislative process. It strengthens and opens a new avenue to reach agreements and build majorities.</p><p>The Pact for Mexico is a major political agreement, but it is also a national project that everyone can share in and endorse. We invite civil society organizations, researchers, academics, unions, business leaders, and the media to join and adhere to this Pact for Mexico. We invite each and every one of our citizens to know this Pact, and to make it their own. Through the various social networks and technology platforms, we will open this Pact to society. Everyone can sign it and join in the great transformation of Mexico. We all need to promote Mexico's transformation, and recognize that this is Mexico's time.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[The Strength to Emerge]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[the-strength-to-emerge]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The three largest banking groups in Colombia, which control around 60% of the country's banking operations, are all in the hands of Colombians. What are the strengths of the Colombian financial sector and how would you assess the interest of foreign investors in recent years?</h4><p>In general, Colombia's financial system has traditionally shown interesting growth and return opportunities in a stable regulatory environment. This makes it attractive for incumbent players, both local and international, and for new foreign participants alike. In particular, with regard to the Colombian financial system, there are two key points I would like to highlight. The first is strong growth. Six-year compound growth rates ranging from 15% to 20% for loans, deposits, equity, and net income are especially impressive considering this period included a global financial crisis. We expect this strong growth to continue over the medium to long term, given the positive prospects of the Colombian economy's growth and the significant room for credit expansion in the country because of the low credit penetration of our financial system as a percentage of GDP when compared to other countries. Colombia's financial system gross loans represent 33% of GDP, lower than countries like Brazil (43%), and Chile (65%). Second, strong levels of capitalization and sound loan quality and having gone through a mortgage crisis of our own in the late 1990s, Colombian financial institutions emerged stronger with healthy loan portfolios, better provisioned balance sheets, and much higher levels of capitalization well above the minimums required by regulations.</p><h4>What was the strategy behind Grupo Aval's purchase of BAC Credomatic?</h4><p>Four to five years ago, Grupo Aval made the strategic decision to become a leading regional player, growing outside of Colombia. BAC Credomatic was the perfect target to launch that strategy as it provided us the leading regional player in Central America with a presence in all seven countries, in a market with strong connections to Colombia. Further, BAC Credomatic was then and continues to be a very well-run business, with a very profitable credit card niche, and with significant growth potential both in its natural market and in new businesses arising from Colombian clients doing business in Central America. The results have proven us right. BAC's profits have grown from approximately $150 million when we acquired it in 2010, to over $260 million in 2012.</p><div class="quote">“In the short to medium term, Grupo Aval will be the leading regional financial player."</div><h4>Is Grupo Aval planning to make further acquisitions in the short term, and are there any particular markets you're looking into?</h4><p>Grupo Aval is constantly looking for acquisition opportunities to enhance and complement our financial service offerings in our current core markets of Colombia and Central America, and to expand, with a relevant presence, in new related markets. As such, under the right conditions, Grupo Aval would potentially make new acquisitions following the same rigorous process we've used successfully in the past.</p><h4>Colombia's financial stability has positioned it well to play a more important role nationally as well as internationally. What is your outlook for Colombia's financial sector going forward?</h4><p>Colombia's financial sector should continue to grow significantly in the medium term. The country has significant growth potential given the existing room for credit expansion to current clients and by introducing first-time users to the financial sector. Furthermore, Colombia has a strong financial regulatory environment that is constantly introducing new regulations to guarantee the financial strength of the bank's financial statements. This market will keep attracting new players that will increase competition and enhance value propositions to clients. Also, competition constantly makes us innovate and transform or else risk losing market share. Finally, this momentum will provide us with the resources and the competitive edge to continue the international expansion of Colombian financial institutions into relevant markets—Central America, the Caribbean, and other leading countries in South America.</p><h4>What are Grupo Aval's short€term investment plans and how do you envision the future of the group?</h4><p>In the short to medium term, Grupo Aval will be the leading regional financial player, offering, through our affiliates, the best financial services portfolio to our clients. For every financial need of a potential client in our regional markets, we strive to offer the right product and service through one of our affiliates. We will keep considering different alternatives to do so by designing those products and services in-house or by acquiring those that already provide them. In doing so, Grupo Aval's investors, both equity and debt, will benefit as we consistently provide market-leading growth and returns. In the very short term, we will close on our latest $530 million acquisition of BBVA Horizonte, which will improve the position of our pension fund manager Porveni as the leader in Colombia.</p><h4>What is your economic outlook for Colombia in 2013 and beyond?</h4><p>We are bullish about Colombia's economy. I expect the country to grow at approximately 4% in 2013 and even better in subsequent years. This growth will be accompanied by contained inflation (less than 2% in the last 12 months) moderate unemployment rates (below 10%), a positive trade balance, contained fiscal deficit, and a steady exchange rate. In the following years, Colombia will take advantage of the conditions for sustained growth it has created through macro and fiscal prudency, the Central Bank's inflation monetary policies, the reduction of our sovereign risk regaining our investment grade status, key free trade agreements with core markets such as the US and Europe, and improved conditions for investors. More importantly, growth will come from a diverse base involving infrastructure, oil, mining, agribusiness, services, tourism, and more. Finally, I expect that the financial sector will be a critical driver of Colombia's growth by financing infrastructure and investment projects and the needs of our consumer clients.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the government pushed for enhanced healthcare operations at Saudi German Hospital-Dubai (SGH)?</h4><p>The Dubai government is a great help for us and for all of the private sector in many aspects of business. The government is pushing for the development, improvement, and expansion of the healthcare sector in Dubai. I'm sure that HH Sheikh Mohammed's vision of making Dubai the number one destination for medical tourism in the region and the world will be achieved soon, as his many visions for Dubai have been achieved thus far.</p><h4>Your company's mission is to construct 30 hospitals and employ 50,000 people by 2015. How does Dubai fit into these plans?</h4><p>This hospital has 300 beds, which is Phase I of the plans given to us by HH Sheikh Mohammed. Our second phase of expansion is for six extra specialty hospitals that will be located on the same plot. Each hospital will have 50 beds. Our dream and long-term plan is to build a mini healthcare city with 600 beds and a medical tower with clinics. Dubai is supporting this initiative and we are also carrying out discussions with other Emirates in terms of further expansion. The city has room for expansion in the healthcare sector, especially in terms of advertisements and buzz for medical tourism. We are creating demand throughout the world, and we now have to create supply. This is a growing industry that we are working on as part of a continuous search for talent all over the world.</p><div class="quote">“I've increased the stability and spirit of the hospital, as well as improved the relationships between the staff members."</div><h4>Is your talent base exclusively from Germany and Saudi Arabia, or do you recruit from other areas?</h4><p>We recruit from all over the world and we have 39 nationalities. The nurses are mostly from the Philippines, India, and Pakistan. The doctors are from all over—Germany, Europe, Austria, the UK, Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Canada, Pakistan, and India—and all of them are Western qualified.</p><h4>What initiatives have you spearheaded as CEO of SGH?</h4><p>I've increased the stability and spirit of the hospital, as well as improved the relationships between the staff members. We're working on recruiting and filling the shortage that we have here. We have so many projects we're working on—the dialysis center is open, our sleep lab is open, and the ICU is fully equipped and fully occupied. Our lab has acquired gamma cameras and we are recruiting staff to operate them. We have many projects for partnerships with other national companies and many initiatives still in development. In October 2102, we launched a breast cancer campaign; we were very active with community activities aimed at raising awareness about the importance of child health. In November 2012, we launched a campaign to train parents to give first aid to children, and we are planning to make it a bi-weekly event. From my private experience as a mother, I want to focus on this training program for parents and nannies, because it is important to know how to resuscitate children. Our chief nursing officer is training parents to handle any small emergencies and possibly save a child's life. We also sponsored a free campaign about diabetes with a free exam by our ophthalmologists who examine people's vision. The hospital is not always for treatment, but also awareness, as this is our corporate social responsibility. Awareness and preventative measures are extremely important in medicine. Education and early detection can save many lives and also improve the quality of life in general.</p><h4>What draws new patients to SGH Dubai?</h4><p>The main draw is quality. We are the largest hospital and the biggest group in the region. Currently, we're known because of our brand name. Many patients come to us because they know the SGH name. Many of them are already our patients at our hospitals in Saudi Arabia. Many are GCC citizens who visit Dubai, especially during the holidays. There will be 1 million tourists here over the holidays, and many are from Saudi Arabia. Around the world we are working on medical tourism, which means building a brand through advertisement. The Dubai Health Authority (DHA) is helping us with this program, and Emirates airlines is also offering their support. Dubai meets all the requirements to become number one in medical tourism. There are daily flights to Dubai and many hotels, and the city is very beautiful with excellent infrastructure and a safe and stable environment. People are not afraid to come here. However, when medical tourists come, if they don't see the good service they're expecting, they will not come back.</p><h4>Which medical services do international patients most commonly seek at SGH Dubai?</h4><p>Surgery is the most common, followed by general and executive check-ups. People want to see all the clinics and be tested at every lab. There are a few complicated cases for trauma and surgery, mainly people who have seen many doctors. We see either very easy cases or very complicated ones. Something routine such as appendix removal, we don't see as much between international patients.</p><h4>What are your professional and company goals in 2013?</h4><p>As CEO, I want to prove myself. As a female, that has been a huge challenge. However, all of my staff are very supportive. None of them want to disappoint their CEO, and I appreciate this allegiance as I consider it one part of success. As a CEO, it is important to ensure that your passion is your employees' passion as well. Our staff considers this hospital their second home and they thoroughly enjoy their work. If anyone is having any difficulty, my door is always open and I will work to solve their problems. I also want to improve, grow, and build our brand name, proving that this Emirate is the place for growth and the place to attract investors from all over the world. We came in and we knew no one, but the authorities helped and supported us, and now it's our job to prove to them that we deserved their support and will give the best care to the citizens of their city and Emirate.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the current state of development of the infrastructure sector in Colombia, and what impact will public-private partnerships (PPPs) have on the industry?</h4><p>We currently operate in Colombia as a concessionary for Ruta del Sol Sector II, a road infrastructure project that goes from Puerto Salgar in Cundinamarca to San Roque in César, and has an approximate length of 528 kilometers. Our expected investment in the project will be Ps3.4 billion. Our partners are the Colombian companies Estudios y Proyectos del Sol and CSS Constructores. In this regard, we are very interested in the further development of infrastructure projects in the country, and we welcome the great efforts made by the government of Colombia to boost the sector. In this context, PPPs will be key in the future development of the industry.</p><h4>How is the Ruta del Sol project progressing? What does this project mean for the country?</h4><p>We are pleased with the development of the work so far, as we have paved more than 110 kilometers already and we expect to completely finish it by April 2016. The project is of high importance for the country, as it will be the final link between the mountains and the coastal cities of Barranquilla and Cartagena. It will definitely contribute to the development of the logistics and tourism sectors of the country. Currently, around 70% of the users of the Ruta del Sol road are heavy vehicles. We also have to put this crucial project into context, because after the several free-trade agreements (FTAs) Colombia has signed, the project has become essential.</p><div class="quote">“Currently, Peru and Colombia represent the most important operations in the South American region for the company."</div><h4>What encouraged Odebrecht to invest in Colombia?</h4><p>Overall, we were drawn by Colombia's high levels of legal security, political stability, government encouragement for infrastructure projects across the country, domestic growth levels, and its geostrategic location. The country can easily become a regional logistics hub.</p><h4>What's behind the potential partnership agreement with Riopaila?</h4><p>We have been talking to many different stakeholders in the Colombian ethanol industry to get a better understanding of the local market opportunity for ethanol. We believe that ethanol could play an important role in the energy sector, boosting gasoline fuel by adding up to 20% to the mixture. We would love to support Latin American countries to develop their ethanol production capacity, increasing renewable energy participation in the energy matrix, and contributing to reducing CO2 emissions and making ethanol a worldwide fuel solution. Odebrecht is also open to entering the energy sector, where we have already several ongoing projects in Brazil and Peru. In this context, the Colombian energy sector is rapidly growing and Odebrecht can contribute to such development thanks to its international experience. We are currently looking into specific projects within the generation segment. However, we mostly focus on infrastructure and road projects in Colombia right now, and the other option could be a medium- to long-term vision.</p><h4>What are some of the other ongoing projects for the company in Colombia?</h4><p>We are very interested in all of the fourth-generation PPP projects the government plans to widely tender, and we evaluated all of the proposed projects. At the moment, we are preparing for the pre-qualification process. We are mainly talking about four processes named Victorias Tempranas, Cartagena-Barranquilla, Girardot-Puerto Salgar, the circumvallation of Bogotá and Mulalo-Loboguerrero road projects. We believe we can qualify for all of the tendering processes. However, the competition will be tough.</p><h4>What are the main challenges the road infrastructure industry faces in Colombia?</h4><p>The government has a very ambitious plan to construct dual carriageways. For example, we constructed 76 kilometers of dual carriageway out of the 207 kilometers constructed in 2012. In 2013, we have already developed 30 kilometers of this type of road infrastructure. The main issue for the future will be to de-bureaucratize and accelerate processes because issues regarding the mitigation of the environmental impact of the projects are slowing them down heavily, especially in terms of environment licenses. Simplifying the process would be key for the country to capitalize on the huge growth and development capacity that it has. In addition, the development of road infrastructure projects is essential for Colombia to take better advantage of the numerous FTAs it has recently signed. These types of projects will not only benefit foreign companies coming to Colombia, but will make local companies more competitive as well.</p><h4>How would you rate Colombia's human capital?</h4><p>I believe that sourcing human capital is one of the main challenges ahead for the country. In our particular case, we base our success on the expertise and quality of human capital; wherever we set up operations, we always aim at hiring the highest number of local workers. I would even say that this challenge does not only apply to Colombia, but many countries around the world. Hiring and integrating them into the company's structures is a very tough challenge. In Colombia, there are a reduced number of Brazilian expatriates working for Odebrecht. In this context, we have our in-house facilities to train workers and integrate them into our structures. Outsiders are welcome to join our programs, as it also works as a small university that offers job opportunities afterward. For example, in 2012 we hired around 4,000 people worldwide out of 7,000 trainees. For this year, we want to maintain these figures because the industry and the development of many Latin American economies require it. In addition, and in the context of Colombia, we also have several agreements with universities, and for example, we have 45 such graduates currently working for Odebrecht.</p><h4>How do you see Odebrecht's operations evolving in Colombia, and what roles does Colombia play in the company's overall activities?</h4><p>Currently, Peru and Colombia represent the most important operations in the South American region for the company. Today, we have two key projects in Colombia—the Ruta del Sol Sector II and the transversal road of Boyacá. Obviously, Ruta del Sol is a key project not only for Colombia, but for the company's global operations, and for that reason it is our main focus at the moment. At the same time, there are some potential projects such as the roads I previously mentioned. We are also studying the navigability of the Magdalena River. There is huge potential to further expand our activities in the country, and I believe Colombia will become an even more important market for the company's global operations. Odebrecht is open to analyze and explore new projects in Colombia, a country that holds great potential in terms of road, maritime, and energy infrastructure projects. Cartagena and Barranquilla need to see further developments in their maritime infrastructure in order to be able to better channel the opportunities that will come from the FTAs, and our company is more than ready to step into any interesting project in this field, regardless of it being private or public.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>To what extent will special economic zones be the engine of Mozambique's economic growth?</h4><p>We started to approve projects in 2009, and some of them are entering into production this year. Many projects are still in the construction phase, and we are focused on building factories and importing the needed capital equipment. We will probably see the effect of these special economic zones projects in the next three to four years. We are also expecting more foreign investment that will contribute substantially to the economy because we are talking about industries and services that are not related to anything that is already here.</p><h4>Which sectors are being targeted for investment in the Nacala Special Economic Zone?</h4><p>The special economic zones are for a wide range of activities, from industry and agro-business to services. We are promoting investment in tourism, and there are also areas for heavy industries such as iron ore, fertilizer plants, and chemical plants for gas in Nacala Velha, at the other side of the bay, as well as areas on the south side of the bay where we are promoting more assembly lines for electronics. Current indications show that there is very strong participation from agro-businesses in Nacala. We are in a region that produces many things, and we are mainly promoting agro-business because we are close to a port, and we also aim to increase exports as well.</p><h4>How would you characterize the size and source of agro-business investment?</h4><p>More than 60% of the investment as a whole is national. From that, around half is agro-business. Foreign investment will grow, and we expect it to become larger than the national investment pool. The top contributors of foreign investment are Portugal, Tanzania, and China. The projects that have been approved since 2009 are all small and medium sized, ranging anywhere up to $15 million.</p><div class="quote">“The special economic zones are for a wide range of activities, from industry and agro-business to services."</div><h4>What sort of industry are you expecting to set up shop in Beluluane Industrial Park, the industrial free zone near Maputo?</h4><p>Beluluane Industrial Park was created to support Mozal, and until now 90% of the businesses located in that area support Mozal; some 25 of the 26 companies working in the park are working with Mozal. Export-oriented industries have not yet been developed there. Last year a new company was established independently from Mozal, and that is the only company in the industrial free zone that is producing and exporting. At present, we are in the process of improving the management structure of the park. There are about 700 hectares of land available, but only 50 hectares have been utilized so far. Much of the land has not been used since 2001. There are two types of industry that we are looking to target. In the northern part of the park there is land that was reserved for heavy industry like cement factories, and some of this land has already been purchased. It is also reserved for some industries that are using aluminum as a raw material from Mozal, and there are also some companies that are electricity-intensive. On the east side of the park we aim to develop several assembly lines based on the competencies of the companies we are working with.</p><h4>How does GAZEDA work with the airport authorities to plan how best to link the special economic zones with transportation infrastructure?</h4><p>All the transportation studies that have been made in Nacala's special economic zones are going through GAZEDA. We have completed two feasibility studies in partnership with our Japanese counterparts on the area rehabilitation and expansion of the port that was made here in partnership with a Japanese firm. This study has finished, and we are securing funds for its rehabilitation from Japan. GAZEDA is seeking investment in infrastructure, and we are a part of the negotiations, including the Ministry of Transport. Additional transportation infrastructure, the nearby port, the coal ports, and the petroleum ports, are all included in the master plan.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[winds-of-change]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the company evolved since it entered the insurance market 40 years ago?</h4><p>The business idea behind Tecniseguros was born between four friends that saw a gap in the insurance market, especially in terms of counseling and establishing an insurance broker. Therefore, the company was established on February 23, 1973. I personally joined the company in August 1973, when, at that time, the company needed an accountant. Since then, we have set the standard in insurance brokerage and consulting at various levels, becoming a leading insurance consultancy company. The continuous support of worldwide and local leading groups like Alexander and Alexander, Johnson &amp; Higgins, and Marsh Inc. gives our clients a solid guarantee of first-class, international-quality service. A perfect combination of high-quality standards and excellent services, focused on the specific needs of the different sectors we offer integral coverage for, guarantees the satisfaction of our clients. Our company holds a 98% customer loyalty rating, which is our best cover letter. The insurance sector has changed dramatically over the past four decades. I remember that at the beginning it was very tough road for us, for there was no insurance culture in Ecuador at all. However, thanks to our entrepreneurial spirit and through the differentiation of products and services, we achieved our high targets over the years.</p><h4>What role does Tecniseguros play in Grupo Futuro's overall activities and strategies?</h4><p>We are an insurance brokerage company, and we provide services to the other insurance companies of the Group, as well as some other companies in the sector. Therefore, we are a very active player in the entire industry, for our annual turnover is $110 million in premiums. In terms of the percentage contribution to the Group, our role has evolved over the years. At the beginning, we contributed the most to the company's portfolio in terms of production and distribution. Today, we still play a very important role in the generation of dividends for the Group.</p><div class="quote">“We have clients in a wide range of economic sectors such as oil, engineering, and construction."</div><h4>In your opinion, what is the state of development of the reinsurance industry in Ecuador?</h4><p>The percentage of reinsurance in Ecuador is actually high, because the capacity of local insurance companies to support such eventualities is rather low. For that reason, we have seen many investments from local and foreign companies in this segment. Today, I would say that both the insurance and the reinsurance sectors in Ecuador are very competitive, and the beneficiary of such competitiveness is the consumer. As Tecniseguros, we welcome such competition in the market, for it helps us become stronger. In this regard, I think the market will have positive and sustainable growth in the future, and we will see a further increase of regulatory control from the main national body.</p><h4>Who are some of your main clients?</h4><p>We have a strong focus on the corporate segment of the market. In this regard, we have clients in a wide range of economic sectors such as oil, engineering, and construction. We provide cover for both large corporates and for SMEs. However, we have to keep in mind that public works projects have driven the growth of the sector over the last few years, and we cannot access that segment. In addition, the health and individual insurance segments will assist the growth of the sector in the near future, as trends have already shown in the last couple of years. In this context, Tecniseguros has, in many cases, taken the lead in terms of innovation in the industry. Currently, corporate companies represent 80% of our client portfolio, whereas the remaining 20% are individuals. Our main future strategy is to attack this segment to further grow our presence in the market.</p><h4>What are some of the most in-demand insurance products?</h4><p>Regarding corporates, they mostly insure their assets: property, plants, equipment, land, and fleets. However, we have a wide range of products available to consumers that commercialize around 40 different insurance companies in the country, and over the years we have become the leading company in the industry thanks to two key words in our strategy: trust and reliability.</p><h4>What is your business strategy to maintain your leading position in the market?</h4><p>Being the market leader for over three decades now is something very difficult and demanding. Our main challenge is to maintain such a leading position in the future, for we have been the reference company in the sector. We believe we have plenty of opportunities to do so by further expanding our presence in the individual insurance segment. Our aim is to provide services and products to each Ecuadorean family. At the same time, we have to keep up our hard work in the corporate segment and for SMEs. We have done much to professionalize the industry by investing large amounts of time and money in training professionals for the sector. We will continue to do so, for our most valuable asset is our human capital.</p><h4>What are the competitive advantages of Tecniseguros as compared to its rivals in the sector?</h4><p>Innovation, leadership, experience, and the continued improvement of the services we provide to our clients as well as the value-added of our services and products are our main competitive advantages. For that reason, we invest a lot in our human capital. We currently have 300 people working for us. Over the last five years, we have grown from around 210 people to 300, for we have expanded activities as well as our sales workforce.</p><h4>How has your partnership with Marsh evolved since it was established?</h4><p>We work as a correspondent in the region for this worldwide leader, and we are a part of its international network of associated companies. We have a very productive relationship. Currently, Marsh provides us with new industry trends, and best practices in administration and risk management, which all benefit our clients.</p><h4>What is your general outlook on the insurance industry for the future?</h4><p>The insurance industry has considerably evolved over the last two decades, and consumers have become more aware of their needs and the availability of products. For that reason, we have seen a specialization process among insurance companies in order to better grab market share. Competition has increased, causing positive outcomes, and that has contributed to better manage the risks of our customers. In other words, we had to become better counselors for them. The increasing purchasing power and the large amounts of investment injected by the government have created many opportunities for the industry. That has and will continue to drive the expansion of the sector. The growth of the industry has been supported by an increase in the sale of cars and the fact that finance institutions have incorporated and promoted insurance activities. This will also increase the sale of insurance as the per capita consumption of insurance in Ecuador is low compared to countries like Colombia and Mexico.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your incoming strategy aimed at strengthening public finances?</h4><p>Our priority is to maintain healthy public finances. Thus, at the beginning of his administration, President Enrique Peña Nieto instructed a balanced budget for 2013. It encompassed an unaltered tax structure and a reduction of government debt. While we have been able to maintain fiscal stability, public expenditure—excluding Pemex and CFE—has been less than 20% of GDP, while the average in Latin America is approximately 27% of GDP and 46% in OECD countries. This has impacted access to services such as education, health, infrastructure, and social security, among others. At the same time, Mexico still has a considerable margin to improve its tax revenue base; if we include tax revenues from oil, Mexico's income is close to 16% of GDP, but just 10% if we exclude it. These figures are low when compared with other economies; for example, the average level of tax revenues in Latin America and in OECD countries are close to 19% and 25% of GDP, respectively. Hence, there is a need for Mexico to implement a comprehensive and sound fiscal reform. On the expenditure side, in addition to the austerity guidelines established at the beginning of the administration, the government will adopt broader efficiency, transparency, and accountability measures. We will also follow the guiding principle that any increase in expenditure will be consistent with fiscal balance and a corresponding increment in revenues.</p><h4>How important a role will fiscal reform play in the government's strategy, and where do you want to see the most immediate changes?</h4><p>The fiscal reform will play a critical role in driving economic development, allowing us to increase those actions and programs that benefit the population in areas such as health, education, and social security, among others. At this moment, we are still analyzing the different alternatives. However, it is important to note that in order to maximize its effects, fiscal reform should involve all levels of government. We must ensure that both federal and local governments take part in this effort; especially considering that a significant margin to increase tax revenues lies at the subnational level. Therefore, effective coordination with local governments is vital for successful fiscal reform. Additionally, fiscal reform has to keep three other objectives in mind. First, it must simplify the current tax system because it has become very complicated as legal loopholes were closed in a piecemeal fashion. Second, we have to keep in mind that both the tax and spending structures change incentives for individuals to be in the formal sectors of the economy, so any reform has to reduce informality. Third, we need to make sure that it is a fair system as mandated by our constitution.</p><div class="quote">“Mexico's macroeconomic stability will continue as a government priority."</div><h4>Mexico's strength as a prime contender for regional economic prowess is to a large extent attributed to its overall fiscal stability. What role does the Secretariat play in supporting this?</h4><p>Mexico's macroeconomic stability will continue as a government priority. Our country has adopted important reforms to achieve this goal, such as providing statutory autonomy to the Central Bank; introducing a legal mandate for fiscal discipline; consolidating a free-floating exchange rate regime; introducing a defined-contribution pension system; and ensuring permanent efforts to maintain a sound regulatory framework for the financial system. In addition to all these policies, we have a two-year flexible credit line (FCL) for $73 billion with the IMF and international reserves at historical maximum levels of $165 billion. The capitalization levels of Mexican banks are higher than the regulatory minimums of 10.5% established in the Basel III agreements—Mexico is one of the few countries to have adopted Basel III requirements. Mexico has successfully tackled fiscal revenue risks related to oil prices through the derivative markets. Furthermore, Mexico has used catastrophe bonds and reinsurance schemes to transfer risks linked to natural disasters. These instruments have attracted international attention, positioning Mexico as a key player in natural disaster financial risk management</p><h4>What levels of growth do you project for the Mexican economy in 2013, and how do you foresee inflation rates impacting the economy?</h4><p>The Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit's growth forecast for the national economy is 3.5% in 2013, well above the expected economic growth for most developed economies worldwide. Nevertheless, this is not enough. We need structural reforms in order to achieve higher economic growth to meet the challenges in education, health, and poverty alleviation in the coming years. Democratizing productivity is one of the main premises that will guide public policies conducted by the Secretariat in order to achieve the desired GDP growth. Democratizing productivity implies reforms to expand human capital through higher educational standards. It also means opening access to investments in the energy sector, higher investment in R&amp;D, and further financing options for social entrepreneurship. We are working to implement significant reforms to transform Mexico. Macroeconomic stability has had a positive impact resulting in moderate levels of inflation and lower country risk levels that have given Mexico access to cheaper external credit. A direct consequence of macroeconomic stability and low inflation are the historic low interest rates: 4.12% for short-term rates (CETES 28 days at February 28, 2013) in the secondary market; inflation is under control at below 4%, and it is expected to drop to 3.66% in 2013; and the interest rate spread between domestic long-term bonds (10 years) and short-term bonds (one year) is 81 basis points (bps). At present, Mexico faces better financing conditions. On January 7, 2013, the federal government issued $1.5 billion in UMS Bonds due in 2044 at the lowest cost in history: the rate differential between the 30-year UMS Bond and the US Treasury Bond reached a historical minimum of 110 bps.</p><h4>Do you expect an upgrade in Mexico's sovereign rating in the medium term, and what sort of inward foreign investment flows do you expect looking ahead?</h4><p>Responsible economic policies in Mexico have allowed us to maintain low debt levels and a sustainable fiscal balance. At the same time, our country has experienced a period of macroeconomic stability, with low inflation and interest rates, as well as a flexible exchange rate, which has worked as a buffer in periods of financial stress. The domestic sector in Mexico has expanded, which has been supported by an increase in employment and credit. These factors, along with the recent approvals of the labor and education reforms, as well as the reforms that will take place in 2014, will improve our sovereign rating. Looking ahead, we expect that foreign investment flows will continue increasing as a result of stable macroeconomic fundamentals and the implementation of structural reforms that will enhance investor confidence in Mexico.</p><h4>To what extent do you think that Mexico will remain vulnerable to volatile business cycles in connected developed economies such as the US?</h4><p>Mexico's economic growth is highly integrated with the US business cycle, particularly in the manufacturing sector. A downturn in the US economy is likely to affect the country's economic performance. However, in recent years domestic demand has grown stronger, supported by increasing competitiveness. At the same time, Mexico has diversified its export portfolio to reduce such vulnerability. Also, historical high international reserves coupled with the recent renewal of the IMF's Flexible Credit Line and the flexible exchange rate mechanism are important tools that may mitigate any external economic and financial shocks.</p><h4>What is your overall outlook for 2013?</h4><p>We expect the economy to grow 3.5% in 2013, with an inflation rate close to the Central Bank's target of 3% and a current account balance of -1.2% of GDP. Domestic demand is expected to continue growing supported by job creation and credit expansion. In the medium term, the structural reform agenda will consolidate stronger economic growth. However, risks persist in the global economy, where EU countries have yet to implement decisive actions to solve their financial and debt problems, and where the US and Japan need to establish credible medium-term fiscal adjustments.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-rise-of-the-middle]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Spain is the third largest investor in Colombia. How would you assess economic relations between the two nations?</h4><p>I would like to start by affirming that Colombia is a strategic country for the Spanish government. Therefore, I greatly value our economic relations. As for the figures, since 1993 Spain has invested ‚¬5.79 billion in Colombia. That is a considerable investment. Spain is highly present in sectors such as finance, infrastructure, insurance, and telecommunications. However, with an increasingly improving environment, we believe this will continue to grow. For now, it represents 5% of total Spanish investment in Latin America, which amounts to ‚¬118 billion. Moreover, the entry into force of the free trade agreement (FTA) between Colombia and the EU will allow our commercial relations to reach their full potential. In 2011, Spain exported ‚¬561 million worth of goods to Colombia, while imports from Colombia to Spain totaled ‚¬1.23 billion. These figures can be improved.</p><h4>What areas of bilateral trade have more potential for growth?</h4><p>At present, railway equipment, textiles and clothing, and industrial machinery represent our top three exports to Colombia. With the coming into force of the FTA between Colombia and the EU, the products that should benefit more from the immediate lowering of tariffs are olive oil, wine, canned seafood, pharmaceuticals, garments and clothing accessories, footwear and textiles, and yarns—mainly silk, wool, and cotton. Oil and coal account for almost 80% of Colombian exports to Spain. There is thus much room for Colombia to export more value-added products, not forgetting services.</p><div class="quote">“Colombia is the confirmation of the emergence of middle powers."</div><h4>Why is Colombia an attractive destination for Spanish investment?</h4><p>Colombia offers a privileged location at the center of the American continent, within six hours of the major Latin American capitals and the US, and with access to ports in the Caribbean, the Atlantic, and the Pacific. With 47.5 million inhabitants, it is the second largest Spanish-speaking population in the world and its GDP per capita has steadily grown in recent years, from $5,826 in 2000 to $9,920. In addition to a large and growing domestic market, Colombia has free trade with a great part of the continent, including the US and Canada. Colombia has also opened up widely to Asia and Europe, which has significantly expanded the potential demand that can be met from this country. We must also underline the great potential of the Pacific Alliance, of which Colombia is a Member State with Mexico, Peru, and Chile, and of which Spain is an Observer State, along with Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Uruguay, Costa Rica, and Panama.</p><h4>As Spain reels from a crisis environment, what advantages does Colombia offer as a hedge for domestic investors?</h4><p>Colombia is one of the countries in the region to offer strong facilities for doing business and for investor protection. Colombia provides legal certainty and clear and stable rules, thanks to strong institutions that are independent, credible, and predictable in their responsibility and seriousness. These are essential ingredients for long-term investment. That's how you build trust and attract new businesses that want to diversify their markets. Thus, the interest of Spanish firms in Colombia is growing, not only large companies, but increasingly small and medium ones as well. In late 2010, there were 140 Spanish companies registered in the country. Currently, there are more than 260. The sectors with the largest presence of Spanish companies are construction, engineering, and ICT.</p><h4>How will the FTA between the EU and Colombia stimulate relations between Spain and Colombia?</h4><p>The trade agreement between Colombia and the EU will certainly encourage our trade relations and investment in both directions by offering zero tariffs for most products and a stable legal framework for investment. Beyond products and investment, to which I referred above, the beneficial effects for the whole economy should be underlined. By promoting exports, national income increases and can be redistributed throughout the population, improving social cohesion. Overall, the positive effects are major and fade into the economy, to the benefit of its citizens. Colombia is a renewed opportunity for Spain, but Spain also for Colombia. Colombian companies are increasingly international, are increasingly investing in Latin America, and will be able to do so in Spain under the best conditions—the same goes for Spanish companies. Spain is its natural gateway, and the closest to the world's largest market: the EU.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Colombia's economic future, and for relations between the two nations?</h4><p>Colombia is the confirmation of the emergence of middle powers. Colombia has been identified among the new emerging economies of the 21st century. In the group of CIVETS: Colombia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Egypt, Turkey, and South Africa, Colombia has adapted to globalization in an exemplary manner and is already reaping the rewards. It is showing that with strong institutions, ambition, commitment, sacrifice, and a clear course, no conflict can halt the will of freedom, peace, and progress in society. On my first trip to Latin America as President, I went to Bogotá. I said then that I believe in Colombia, in its present, and in its future, and I say it wherever I go. Colombia and Spain are examples of continuity in foreign policy. Colombia knows that Spain understands its reality and can count on its permanent support. Our strength is our desire to define and regularly renew our level of ambition, and to offer our citizens new horizons. We believe that what is good for Colombia is good for Spain, and at the same time, what is good for Spain is good for Colombia.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The majority of franchises, if not all them, host academies and winter teams in the Dominican Republic. How important is this country to Major League Baseball?</h4><p>The Dominican Republic is very special to Major League Baseball, for reasons that go beyond the staggering numbers of Dominican Major League and Minor League players. I believe baseball is a part of the Dominican Republic's identity. There is a shared passion among Dominican players and fans. Together, they are continuing a remarkable baseball tradition.</p><h4>The Dominican Republic produces more Major League players than any country outside of the US. What steps need to be taken to ensure significant representation of Dominicans throughout the League?</h4><p>The Dominican Republic produced 95 players on 2012 Opening Day rosters and disabled lists, representing its second highest total ever, behind only its 99 in 2007. The 95 players accounted for 11.1% of all Major League players. There continues to be a very strong pool of Dominican Minor League players as well. We need to continue to have an active presence in the Dominican Republic and to build on the great tradition of its people playing for Major League organizations. In order to do that, we must assist in providing the tools that our future players will need not just on the field but also away from it.</p><div class="quote">“I believe baseball is a part of the Dominican Republic's identity."</div><h4>How have the “Alderson reforms" improved talent development in the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>In 2009 Sandy Alderson led a committee that examined how we could improve our operations in the Dominican Republic. Sandy and his group produced a thorough, fascinating report on the various issues that existed and potential ways that we could address them. In March 2010, I asked Sandy to begin to implement many of his recommendations, and so he spent much of the year in the country, working in our office in Santo Domingo and leading our staff there. Sandy confronted longstanding challenges and focused on curbing the use of performance-enhancing substances, reducing attempts of age and identity fraud, and expanding educational opportunities. In all of these areas, our goal was to find solutions that, ultimately, benefited everyone. We have made great progress because of our renewed efforts, with Jorge Perez-Diaz continuing the initiatives that Sandy put in place, followed by our current leadership of Kim Ng and Rafael Perez. Our registration processes and the levels of communication among the parties of the Dominican baseball establishment are much improved. We have seen reductions in cases of age and identity fraud and the use of illegal substances. We have increased the industry-wide exposure that amateur players have received by creating new showcases and amateur tournaments. We wanted to help our clubs protect their investments and to guide aspiring players to make the right choices for not just their careers, but their lives. There is more to accomplish, but I believe we have been very successful so far.</p><h4>What is your view on the possibility of international expansion and realignment of the major leagues, and what role could the Dominican Republic play in this vision?</h4><p>We are committed to maintaining baseball's remarkable international growth, and the Dominican Republic will continue to be a vital part of that. At the moment, expansion is not being contemplated by Major League Baseball. We currently have 30 Major League Clubs and, in 2013, for the first time ever, we will move to 15 teams in both the American and National Leagues, as the Houston Astros will shift to the American League. I believe the Dominican Republic will remain an essential locale for Major League Baseball for the next generation and a source for our global expansion.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize the development of Turkish-British economic relations over the past two decades?</h4><p>As the economies of Turkey and the UK have grown over the last two decades, so has the value of our trade relationship. Bilateral trade between Turkey and the UK was worth £1.5 billion in 1992; in 2011, it was valued at £12.2 billion. UK investment in Turkey has increased significantly with over 2,400 UK companies operating there. This includes many international brands such as HSBC, Rolls-Royce, Vodafone, BP, Shell, Tesco, M&amp;S, and Harvey Nichols. There has also been an increase in Turkish investment in the UK. For example, Beko is now a UK household name as a domestic appliance supplier and an FA Cup sponsor. Turkish Airlines now flies to five destinations in the UK and is a sponsor of Manchester United, and Ramsay, a supplier of men's clothing, is a sponsor for Liverpool FC. Turkey's Customs Union has EU accession status, and this has brought about increased openness in the economy and considerable opportunities for UK-Turkish trade and investment. We have introduced initiatives to strengthen UK-Turkey economic ties. The UK-Turkey Joint Economic and Trade Committee (JETCO), which meets annually at a ministerial level, was set up in 2009 and a Turkish delegation will visit the UK this spring. In 2010, our Prime Ministers signed a Strategic Partnership, under which they committed to double bilateral trade by 2015. In April 2011, the UK/Turkey CEO Forum was established by the Prime Ministers of the UK and Turkey, and has met several times, including during President Gül's state visit to the UK in November 2011.</p><h4>What are the UK's main economic priorities in its relationship with Turkey?</h4><p>Turkey has an ambitious economic vision for 2023, including lessening reliance upon imports to become a net exporter. As it looks to strengthen and diversify its economy, the UK has expertise to share. This includes information in the areas of renewable energy technology, financial and professional services, defense and security, ICT, infrastructure development, and life sciences. We see many high-value opportunities for UK-Turkey collaboration in major Turkish projects, such as Istanbul's third airport, the third bridge across the Bosphorus, the expansion of roads and railways, universal healthcare campuses, rising education standards, and access to technology.</p><div class="quote">“Turkey is a fast-growing, nearly trillion-dollar economy; a fertile ground for British business."</div><h4>What is the importance of the Turkish-British relationship for businesses in both the UK and Turkey?</h4><p>Turkey is a fast-growing, nearly trillion-dollar economy; a fertile ground for British business. It straddles both East and West and is the gateway to Europe. It is fast becoming a regional hub for many business operations in the MENA region, Central Asia, and the South Caucasus countries. Its trading links are growing in Africa, Latin America, and Asia. It has a large and increasingly wealthy middle class with an internal market of 75 million people. The UK exports far more to Turkey, as a proportion of Turkey's GDP, than to any other BRIC or emerging market.</p><h4>You recently announced that the UK aims to double the trade volume between the two countries by 2015. Why is this a priority for the UK?</h4><p>David Cameron and Prime Minister Erdoğan set this goal in 2010 as a challenge to British and Turkish companies. A notable change in our trade relationship over the last two decades has been that the UK has moved from being a net exporter to Turkey to being a net importer, with the UK having recorded a trade deficit with Turkey every year since 2001. UK exports to Turkey rose 38% from 2009 to 2011, and 20% alone in 2011, though they fell in 2012. Our EU partners, with the exception of Italy, have also seen their exports to Turkey fall. This has been in part due to a slowdown in the growth of the Turkish economy. However the longer-term prospects are better and UK exporters can do more business in Turkey, which is why we need to maintain a high level of ambition.</p><h4>Why is it important that Turkey continues to make progress on the path to EU accession?</h4><p>At a time when the EU faces economic challenges and there is continuing instability in the Middle East, our relationship with Turkey matters more than ever for our shared prosperity, security, and values. Increasing trade with Turkey offers opportunities for EU businesses. The country is now the EU's fifth largest export market. Turkish entrepreneurs in Europe run businesses worth ‚¬40 billion, employing 500,000 people. In sectors such as aviation, automobiles, and electronics, our economies are increasingly integrated. Turkey is well placed to become an energy hub, with both sides benefiting from projects to build the necessary infrastructure, including the development of the Southern Gas Corridor. The Turkey of today has been radically transformed from the country that applied to join the EU a quarter of a century ago. Just as the EU helped consolidate democracy across Central Europe and continues to promote democracy in Eastern Europe, the accession process has played a powerful role in supporting Turkey's reforms in areas such as the civilian control of the military and the independence of the judiciary. Significant results have been achieved but, as Turkey itself recognizes, reform remains a work in progress. Improvements are needed in the areas of freedom of expression, women's rights, and the protection of minorities.</p><h4>How would you characterize the medium-term outlook for the Turkish economy, and what does this mean for the UK's priorities in Turkey in the coming years?</h4><p>Turkey's economy is expected to grow steadily over the medium term, with the IMF forecasting that annual GDP growth in each of the next five years will be in the range of 3.5%-4.5%. The country has a young and digitally aware population—over half of its 75 million people are under 30 years of age. It has achieved investment grade status from one of the world's leading credit agencies. When Turkey eventually accedes to the EU, its accessible trade volume has the potential to grow a further 20%. For these reasons, Turkey has been designated an advanced emerging market, and is one of the 20 high-growth priority markets that UK Trade &amp; Investment has identified. Turkey has an ambitious vision for 2023, the 100th anniversary of the founding of the republic. By 2023 it aims to be the 10th largest economy in the world.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of the establishment of AMIS?</h4><p>It has been 75 years since AMIS was founded. It is an association that comprises 85 of the 104 insurance companies in Mexico. In terms of premiums, we make up 90% of the market. The purpose of this association is to promote the interests of the partners. Of course, our members are competitors, but they share the same views, particularly with respect to regulations. This is the focus I intend to bring to the association to promote the development of the industry. I think that there is a huge opportunity in this country for the industry to grow. A figure that is commonly used to measure the size of the sector is revenue to GDP. According to those figures, the insurance sector in Mexico is half the size it is in Chile or Brazil. It is important to have a good understanding of why we do not have a bigger share. The second purpose of our organization is to have very clear objectives, a strategy plan, and a road map to close gaps. This is something that we have just completed.</p><h4>There are some 60 million uninsured potential customers in Mexico. What reasons have you identified for the current low penetration rate?</h4><p>One reason would be the structure of the economy. The second would be public policies, and the third would be regulation. Regulation and public policies are not the same. Mexico has an underdeveloped insurance sector along personal and commercial lines. Regarding personal lines there are two main reasons. One, Mexico is a very young country with respect to others. More than half of the population is 21 years old or under. Number two is that we have a very skewed and unequal distribution of income. In Mexico, a large percentage of the population earns a very low income. To explain why the demand for certain insurance products is not as large as in other countries, let me start with the income level of the Mexican population. The insurance sector is very well penetrated in the high-income levels. Only 5% of households that are not linked to a mortgage are insured in this country. Around 25% are insured because of mortgages, but in addition to mortgages only 5% are insured. If you talk about life insurance, only 15% of the labor force has an insurance policy. In terms of health insurance, only 26% of the cars in this country are insured due to a lack of compulsory insurance. With respect to income distribution, as of data from 2011, we have a country of 112 million or 113 million people. The number of people insured is more or less 21% of the population, which is around 23 million individuals. Therefore, we have more than 85 million people who are underinsured and we have at least 44 million that are not insured. We have huge potential because income distribution is very skewed. There are some individuals who are earning between $100 and $400 per month, and therefore their disposable income is not enough. We are working on micro insurance, but these individuals are, unfortunately, not able to buy certain policies because they cannot afford it. The other reason is that many households are very young, and thus the demand for insurance is very low. That is going to change in the future, which is why there is a lot of opportunity. These are structural things with regards to households and families. With respect to firms, Mexico has a lot of informality. There are, according to the census, 4.8 million firms that have only 1-10 employees. Then, there are 3 million, or 3% of the total, which have more than 51 employees. That means there are a lot of micro firms and informal firms that are not contributing to social security and that are not insuring their property or their employees.</p><div class="quote">“We are working to pass a law that will require every motor vehicle that drives on federal roads to have insurance."</div><h4>Why is there no compulsory insurance for employees?</h4><p>We have very informal markets, very small firms, a very young population, and low income levels. That is why, structurally, the demand for insurance is less than in other countries. But that is an opportunity. A lot of families are going to be formed in the years to come. They will have mortgages, they will have cars, they will have children, and the demand for health insurance is going to grow. We think that the country is going to keep growing. If we transform the structure of the economy by passing some other structural reforms, I am very optimistic about this government. If that happens it will raise the income of many families and also raise the gross distribution that will transform the labor market to where we will have more formal markets. That is why I am very positive with respect to the insurance sector in Mexico. It has been growing faster than GDP and I think that the opportunity is huge. This is the way that many firms abroad see things. This is a very strategic market that most of the important firms in the world are pinpointing. After Brazil, Mexico is the largest market, followed by Argentina. The differences are huge but I think Mexico is going down the path of very rapid expansion. The second reason is public policies. If you compare Mexico to other countries, we are the only country belonging to the OECD that does not have compulsory third-party liability insurance. This has to be put in place now because it will help the insurance industry grow and earn more money; it is a must to protect the victims of accidents.</p><h4>To what extent does the regulatory environment require further development?</h4><p>The Mexican Insurance Commission is very conservative and it has imposed unnecessary costs on firms. Mexico is prone to catastrophes, as are many other countries. However, with respect to disaster insurance, Mexico has capital requirements of over 100% more than in other countries. It makes this type of insurance more expensive. It is either not profitable to supply it, or if you do it you hedge prices, which hardens demand. Some things in the relationship between the regulator and the players have to change in order to encourage the growth of this industry. We are working to pass a law that will require every motor vehicle that drives on federal roads to have insurance. We are close. It has already been approved in both chambers. It was approved in the House of Representatives in Mexico and it was also approved in the Senate. Of course, paying for the cost of capital, we are not going to lose money, but we are not going to make a lot of money. Our business will be in our ability to up-sell and cross-sell. Many individuals will find out that it is a good idea to be insured. Something that will actually help is that the new labor law increases the liabilities of third parties significantly. We have to measure our strategy on these issues because if we are very eager, politicians become very suspicious that we are going to make a lot of money and they will resist the change. I am very optimistic by nature, but I cannot give you a precise date. However, I am certain that it is going to be in the next three to five years.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your top-three targets for 2013, and what is your strategy in order to achieve those?</h4><p>My primary target is to continue to deliver our huge business here in a safe and reliable manner. As operator of Azerbaijan's world-class oil and gas fields, we take pride in our safety and environmental record in the Caspian. For 20 years, we have been the country's reliable partner in developing its huge oil and gas resources for the benefit of the people of Azerbaijan and our partners. We have built an excellent partnership with the people, the government, SOCAR, and other stakeholders. My task is to further develop our safe delivery and reliable partnership. Secondly, I will focus on our production targets. In 2012, our total production from the Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli (ACG) fields was 664,000 barrels per day, which is slightly lower than 33 million tons. Recently, we have thoroughly analyzed our plans for ACG production stabilization and decline management and identified opportunities to respond to the technical challenges presented by the field. We have worked closely with SOCAR to find ways to ensure improved production delivery from 2013 onwards. As a result, we plan to intensify work on new well delivery, focus on some other key production areas, and also complete the Chirag Oil Project activities onshore and offshore, which is scheduled for start up during 4Q2013. My third target would be to further progress the Shah Deniz 2 project by achieving the milestones scheduled for mid-2013—the selection of the European pipeline. This would be followed by the historic, final investment decision that will allow us to commence the execute phase of this giant gas development and export project.</p><h4>What do the recent discoveries in the Shah Deniz block represent for the company, and is there any further offshore exploration planned for Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Indeed, some years ago we announced a further major new gas-condensate discovery in the Shah Deniz field. As a result of our appraisal and exploration wells, we discovered a new high-pressure gas condensate reservoir in a deeper structure below the currently producing reservoir, which extends the field to the south. While we believe this exploration discovery represents a potentially significant find and is a tremendous success for the Shah Deniz partnership and for Azerbaijan, such a deep, high-pressure reservoir will require new technologies that are presently under development in the industry. Therefore our current focus is to develop Shah Deniz Stage 2 with plans to produce an additional 16 billion cubic meters per annum (bcma) of gas to supply regional and European markets. This project is well advanced and with the final investment decision planned for later in 2013, we aim to get the first gas to the markets in 2018. However, I strongly believe that Shah Deniz has a potential for a Stage 3 and even further developments.</p><div class="quote">“Since the earliest days of our presence in Baku, we have prioritized national staff development."</div><h4>How would you evaluate Azerbaijan's role as an energy hub in the future?</h4><p>Azerbaijan clearly has a potential to rightly play an important role in the world's energy supply market. It is already a regional energy hub with its 1.2 million barrels per day (bbl/d) capacity Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline, which in addition to ACG has always welcomed third-party volumes from across the Caspian. There are also two other pipelines—the Baku-Supsa pipeline delivering oil to the Black Sea, and the South Caucasus Pipeline supplying around 7 bcma of gas to Georgia and Turkey. We believe with the start up of Shah Deniz 2 when Azerbaijan's gas enters European markets, Azerbaijan will become more visible and important as an oil and gas supplier. Stage 2, with its total planned capital investment of approximately $40 billion, is currently one of the largest projects anywhere in the world and definitely the largest in BP's worldwide portfolio. We are very glad it will underpin Azerbaijan's plans to establish itself as a major provider of gas to Europe.</p><h4>How does BP help develop national staff?</h4><p>I am proud to be able to say that the vast majority of our employees here are national employees. Since the earliest days of our presence in Baku, we have prioritized national staff development as one of the key elements of our support for the development of the country's energy sector. For many years, we have operated a world-class training facility in Baku that has enabled us to train hundreds of technicians who are doing an excellent job running our complex offshore and onshore operations safely and efficiently. In September 2012, we launched an equally important training program for geoscientists, and surface and drilling engineers. This is a multi-million dollar learning initiative called the petro-technical resource entry program, which is aimed at the capability development of national petro-technical graduates joining BP. In addition, we have a series of local university support programs that aim to promote the education of petro-technical and related disciplines. We hope these initiatives will help us increase still further our annual intake of petro-technical national graduates as it is these disciplines where we still depend heavily on expatriate skills and experience. We directly employ about 2,600 Azerbaijani nationals, with growing numbers in middle and senior leadership positions. Our expatriate staff are expected to coach and develop national colleagues, and transfer key skills in the process. Building the capability of our workforce through hiring and developing the best talent that we can find is one of my key priorities.</p><h4>How would you assess the changes in Azerbaijan's economic development over the past decade?</h4><p>I think a comparison of the 2013 state budget with that of 10 years ago describes the changes in Azerbaijan's economic development over the past decade more impressively than anything else. The government has approved a record high-state budget—circa $25 billion—for 2013. This is huge for a nation with a population of just over 9 million. Economically, Azerbaijan has been developing at an amazingly fast pace. I am aware that according to the assessment of the Davos World Economic Forum, Azerbaijan now ranks 46th globally and is at the top of the former Soviet countries for the competitiveness of its economy. Also, it is very encouraging to see that the 2012 GDP increase was also sourced from non-oil sector growth, which means that the country is skillfully shifting its growth leverages to the non-oil sector. As Azerbaijan's long-term oil and gas development partner, we are pleased to observe that the country is gaining increased recognition as a major contributor to European cultural and sports events. With the success of hosting the Eurovision 2012 Song Contest, Azerbaijan has now been elected as the host country for the first European Olympic Games scheduled for 2015. All this indicates that the country is clearly committed to maintaining the high pace of growth for many years, with greater integration into the world economy, sports, and culture.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Azerbaijan's energy sector in 2013? What are the medium-term plans of BP in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>We believe Azerbaijan's energy sector has the potential to grow for decades. The government has signed a number of new production sharing agreements (PSA), including the one between BP and SOCAR on the joint exploration and development of the Shafag-Asiman structure. We have already conducted the first 3D seismic in that area, and we are currently at the data processing stage, which will continue through 2013. The structure is very promising and we look forward to our first exploration well in a few years time. We also believe that the country's energy future is very much linked to its plans to become a global gas supplier. These plans are mainly based on Shah Deniz. During 4Q2012, we increased the capacity of the entire Stage 1 system to 966 million cubic feet per day (mmcfd), which is almost 10 bcma. We currently have five producing wells and these deliver record rates of producing almost full capacity. Total production in 2012 was around 8 bcm of gas and over 2 million tons of condensate, and in 2013 we expect even higher production levels. Stage 2 has also made significant progress. Great achievements have been made on progressing the South Caucasus Pipeline Expansion (SCPX) with the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) disclosed in January 2013. Great progress has been achieved on the new Trans-Anatolian Pipeline (TANAP), which is planned to be built in Turkey and is set to become a key part of the Southern Gas Corridor linking Azerbaijan's extensive gas resources to Turkish and EU markets. We strongly support TANAP, and we are working closely with other project participants to acquire a 12% interest in this project. We are on track to make the European pipeline selection in mid-2013, with a final investment decision planned for later in 2013. Clearly, the biggest part in Azerbaijan's energy sector belongs to oil. ACG has been and will continue to be for decades one of the world's great oil fields. As the operator of ACG we remain committed to developing ACG safely and reliably so that for many years to come it can benefit Azerbaijan, its people, and our partners.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate Ecuador's investment outlook?</h4><p><strong><span class="red">EDUARDO CHECA</span> </strong>Ecuador, right after Peru, is the country that is forecasted to grow the most in the coming year. In order to make our future sustainable and look at investment in the long term, reducing the level of poverty is key. To do this, we have to be able to attract foreign investment. Other countries in the region, such as Colombia, Peru, Chile, and Brazil, have a base of economic growth that has been established as a result of FDI.</p><h4>The World Bank expects Latin America to grow by almost 4%. What are the main consequences of this and how do you foresee the local economy developing in comparison?</h4><p><span class="red"><strong>RAMIRO CRESPO</strong></span> Expansion has been government-promoted thus far, with significant expenditure because of the high price of oil and loans from China. We have to convince the private sector to invest more in Ecuador and prepare in case the price of oil goes down. This means diversifying our exports and sources of income. There are pending issues such as possible free trade agreements (FTAs) with the US and Europe and the promotion of FDI. It is interesting that four out of five of the largest insurance companies in Ecuador are multinationals. People would not expect that to be the case, but currently the insurance sector is populated by companies from Australia, the US, Spain, and a few other countries. We need more FDI that creates new businesses, such as in the mining, agricultural, and service sectors.</p><div class="quote">“We, as a country, have to tell investors that we are going to be issuing debt responsibly this time around."</div><p><span class="red"><strong>EDUARDO CHECA</strong></span> There has been huge growth and consumption, but I believe that we are relying too much on oil. The more we can diversify the components of our means of growth, the more diversified sectors of growth we will see in the economy. We cannot just depend on oil, and the country has a huge potential in agriculture as the biggest exporter of bananas in the world, and a world-class producer of flowers, asparagus, cacao, and coffee. Rose growers in Ecuador depend heavily on markets in the US and Europe. A considerable percentage of the population works in agriculture and the flower business, and we have to develop the tools to be competitive worldwide and to improve their standards of living. The FTAs are the challenge the government faces, because if we don't have those tools, it will limit our growth.</p><h4>What would you say is Analytica's most significant success story?</h4><p><span class="red"><strong>RAMIRO CRESPO</strong></span> We were named among the top 100 companies in the world in 2010, not only in finance, but also across the board. Even though Ecuador is not on the radar of many foreign investors or investment banks, there are still very good opportunities. We have been able to do our research and focus on our transactions, which led to the company's accolades. There were many investors and hedge funds that voted, so they were  familiar with our work because of our international reach. Many of them received our research, which is one of the reasons we were chosen among the best companies in the world, and were familiar with specific deals and our sophisticated structure.</p><p><span class="red"><strong>EDUARDO CHECA</strong></span> We are also one of the main players in the local exchanges here, especially in terms of issuing debt and trading. We are carrying out a lot of M&amp;A activity, which was noticed by the foreign investors who voted for us. When we were named among the top 100 companies back in 2010, there were only seven Latin American companies chosen.</p><h4>What do you do to promote foreign investment?</h4><p><span class="red"><strong>RAMIRO CRESPO</strong></span> The Ecuadorean insurance market has grown from $600 million to $1.2 billion in the last five years, so we emphasize that this is a growing market. We are also looking for foreign investors who might be overlooking Ecuador and describing to them the ways in which it could be worth their while. The country is growing because it is an oil exporter and the price of oil is high and the government is spending much more. However, to maintain this rate of growth, we need more resources. Foreign investment is one option, whereas another is going back to the international market. The need to maintain the rate of growth might be one of the triggers for policies that will attract more foreign investment. Ecuador is working to return to the international capital markets and is trying to improve its credit rating. For this reason, Ecuador welcomes credit-rating agencies. We don't want to rely only on oil, one foreign investor such as China, or taxes. We need a plethora of new sources.</p><h4>How do you convince the skeptical investor about the financial security of the country?</h4><p><span class="red"><strong>EDUARDO CHECA</strong></span> We, as a country, have to tell investors that we are going to be issuing debt responsibly this time around. We have to convince investors that Ecuador can be like Colombia or Chile in terms of fulfilling international obligations. Another important element to point out is that we are dollarized, and therefore we don't have a currency risk. It gives us a lot of economic and political stability.</p><p><span class="red"><strong>RAMIRO CRESPO</strong></span> It depends on the industry, but in general I argue for the benefits of dollarization, which gave us stability. That is a base to work from, and dollarization also gave us a longer horizon on which to work. The economy is becoming more open. Ecuador is a small country, but we are very rich in natural resources. Not much has to happen for Ecuador to have an additional significant boom in the economy.</p><h4>Do high taxes block private investment?</h4><p><span class="red"><strong>EDUARDO CHECA</strong></span> Yes. The more restraints the government puts on investment, the more the situation drives away investors. This is something the government has to work on, and it is being evaluated.</p><p><span class="red"><strong>RAMIRO CRESPO</strong></span> In addition, the support of local communities is crucial. The authorities are often skeptical about allowing mining or oil exploration on their land, because historically they haven't benefited from it. They haven't received royalties that could have compensated for whatever environmental and social damage they have suffered. Right now, they are requesting and requiring a clear system or design in which they will also benefit directly from the investment itself and not through government expenditure. One of the ways to attract local communities is by including them in the investment process and ensuring that the ecology is damaged a little as possible. They have to be part of the investment in order to help promote what is being done. If we can help them feel like the owners of foreign investment projects, it is always easier to attract foreign investment. In addition, foreign investors would feel safer because the local communities are cooperating.</p><h4>Which sectors would you highlight as key to the development of Ecuador?</h4><p><span class="red"><strong>EDUARDO CHECA</strong></span> Mining, oil, and agriculture. We still need investment in oil, and it may be more attractive for foreign investors. Meanwhile, Ecuador is the largest banana exporter in the world, and we are an excellent source for other types of crops, such as cocoa. Flowers are also important, as is fishing. For long-term investments, agriculture is very important because food is a necessity and nothing is as affordable as it was 20 years ago.</p><p><span class="red"><strong>RAMIRO CRESPO</strong></span> Tourism is also very important for Ecuador. The climate is good for tourists and Ecuadoreans are very friendly. The country is safer than we think, but there is still room for improvement. Real estate here is very affordable in comparison to other countries. The communications infrastructure is also getting better, as we now have widespread access to the internet and other web services. Health services are getting better and better. Many factors are making Ecuador the top international retiree destination. There are interesting things happening in the country, and sometimes people don't realize it because they think of the political problems the country has experienced. We should work to make the private sector play a larger role and thus promote the country as a safe and enjoyable destination.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the evolution of BASF's role in Turkey?</h4><p>From the perspective of how BASF evolved to become what it is today, Turkey is not very different. We started out with dyes in the 19th century—the company was founded in 1865. That was the age of chemistry, the era in which chemicals were being synthesized and chemistry was being understood. Over the next 65 to 70 years, BASF was a major driver at the forefront of chemical companies developing the basics of its industry. At that time, the goal was to build large chemical complexes and export products to the rest of the world. For a long time, BASF was a German company with more global traits. We began trading in Turkey in 1880. It took another 90 years to establish a production site on the ground in the country, which was part of a general move to shift production closer to target markets as logistics became a more important factor in our business. Today, we have expanded through organic growth and acquisitions in Turkey, and our strength is our adaptability to move into value-added and downstream chemicals as a second pillar of our strategy. We have completed this with a portfolio strategy that includes a lot of divestments and acquisitions. Recently, we signed a joint-venture contract for Styrolution with INEOS. At the same time, we have become more involved with care, specialty, and construction chemicals. We have come closer to our customers, and we feel it is beneficial for us as we also focus more on market-driven R&amp;D. Most molecules have already been developed, and to find or develop new, game-changing molecules is not very likely. We have to do more with the existing toolbox of chemistry and combine it in a smart way. For this, we need to be very familiar with what is needed by our customers, today and the day after. We gather together experts from various disciplines to add new value. BASF has grown more than three fold in the last six years in Turkey, from 2005-2011, by applying this strategy. The year 2012 was one of consolidation for us, and we are now preparing for the next growth period. The key criteria we use to invest in a market are two considerably different investment requirements. One is that we move closer to the market and customer only when we can connect closely into a supply chain, which benefits from low transportation costs, and see a large enough market to supply from a new location, or within “striking distance." However, for chemical producers such as BASF, this involves building a major production site for anything from basic petrochemicals to intermediates. There are about 300 intermediate chemicals, out of which 90%-95% of the entire chemical industry is built. We have six verbund—or integrated—production sites around the world, which is often highlighted as a strength of BASF. The decisive factors of investment are availability of feedstock, energy costs, and transport and logistical considerations. If one of the three is not right, the entire investment is in dire straits, so to speak. In terms of the first factor, we would naturally look toward the Middle East for feedstock or North America, where shale gas is becoming available. The second factor, energy costs, is equally as important because the chemical industry naturally consumes huge amounts of energy. The third factor is logistics and the supply chain, and Turkey, with its fantastic geostrategic location, has access to Africa, Central Asia, the Arabian Peninsula, and Europe all by water, land, or air.</p><h4>How would you assess the potential for a future BASF investment in Turkey?</h4><p>For making a large investment in Turkey rather than elsewhere we need an attractive business case. In Turkey, the market itself had grown to a decent size already, and the chemical industry had already been identified as a key part of the economy by the government. In addition, neighboring countries also had the same kind of plans, which is good and bad. The good is that more chemical operations were coming to the market, offering new and complementary products that aren't simply copied and pasted. However, the bad is that when everyone heads in the same direction, especially if there are huge new capacities coming on stream at the same time. Chemical investments are carried out to operate for some 30 to 50 years. Therefore, we need to be absolutely sure that we have favorable conditions where we invest, not just for the investment period, but also for the period affected by variable cost drivers such as feedstock, energy, and transportation.</p><div class="quote">“We can only satisfy customers when we constantly improve, innovate, and offer new solutions."</div><h4>What is the significance of the Turkish market for BASF?</h4><p>Turkey's significance is constantly growing. Currently, we are implementing a new strategy entitled “Creating Chemistry for a Sustainable Future," which was published in late 2011. As part of that strategy, we are focusing for the first time on emerging markets. Turkey is the single most important emerging market neighboring Europe, from where we also manage the wider MENA region. Considering this entire group of 20 interesting, fast-growing countries, Turkey is the only one that has the combination of a huge and growing population, efforts to diversify its economy, and the desire to boost value chains, especially in transportation and automotive assembly. In 2012, Turkey was a net exporter in the automotive industry. Tier 1, 2, and 3 companies are entering Turkey, and this is a phenomenon we are observing very closely because these are our customers. The automotive industry represents 10%-15% of BASF's sales, and we are sometimes asked why we expose ourselves to such a competitive industry demanding the lowest prices all the time. We can only satisfy customers when we constantly improve, innovate, and offer new solutions, beyond a simple product with prices that are fluctuating up and down with oil prices and, in recent years, only up. Chemistry is an important enabler for the automotive industry. We are helping the automotive industry think in new ways by providing new solutions, and this keeps our organism alive. BASF truly believes that its products and solutions, as well as its ability to engage in this dialogue, make it a very good partner for the Turkish automotive sector.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Having served as Minster of Transport for 10 years, what would you say some of your major accomplishments have been?</h4><p>In recent years, the activities of the transport sector have been focused on a major overhaul of the entire transport infrastructure, the complete satisfaction of the population, the economic needs for transport services, and the effective organization of business with the aid of ongoing reform. These goals have always been in the spotlight of the Ministry of Transport. Specific measures have been taken to accurately fulfill the tasks laid down in various state programs. Over the last 10 years, the volume of permanent investment in road transport infrastructure has reached AZN7.4 billion. The average annual growth in freight traffic is 8.18%, and 5.54% in passenger traffic. A total of 1.6 billion tons of cargo and 11.4 billion passengers have been transported. The average annual growth in the turnover of cargo and passenger transportation has been 17.36% and 6.9%, respectively. The volume of cargo in the Europe-Caucasus-Asia international transport corridor was 465.4 million tons, registering average annual growth of 5.12%. The volume of transit transportation in said corridor is 145.8 million tons. Due to the transition of Azerbaijan to a market economy, the transport sector has undergone institutional reform, and the transport infrastructure and management institutions have been significantly modernized and upgraded. In order to ensure effective management and regulation of the road transport sector in the conditions of new economic relations, “The Single Transport Policy Concept of the Republic of Azerbaijan," “The Strategy on the Development of a Transport System in the Republic of Azerbaijan," and “The Transit Strategy of the Republic of Azerbaijan" have been developed to facilitate integration into the international system of transport and contribute to the overall development of the country's transport infrastructure. In order to facilitate its integration into the international system of transport, eight laws have been adopted, 16 presidential decrees signed, 79 decisions and resolutions of the Cabinet of Ministers issued, 106 bilateral and multilateral agreements on cooperation in the field of transport concluded with a number of countries, and 27 memorandums signed. In addition, the Republic has joined 15 agreements and conventions of the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE).</p><h4>What is the country's aviation policy for opening up more international air links to regional cities in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>A total of AZN956.3 million has been invested in the development of the aviation sector and renewal of the air fleet. Over the past several years, four Airbus-319s, four Boeing-757s, one Boeing-727, one Boeing-747, two ATR planes, and six helicopters have been purchased. In addition, a modern Baku Cargo Terminal with logistical management meeting modern requirements has been commissioned. An international airport has been built in Gabala, while international airports in Nakhchivan, Ganja, Zagatala, and Lankaran have been renovated. Work is currently underway on the construction of a new terminal, runway, and four hangars at the Heydar Aliyev International Airport. In order for the aviation infrastructure to further enhance the transit potential of the region and to develop the country's tourism industry, a process has been started to upgrade the national air fleet. Plans have also been put in place to declare the country's international airports free economic zones.</p><div class="quote">“The fact that the TRACECA and North-South international transport corridors converge on Azerbaijan has led to the emergence of an important transport hub in Eurasia"</div><h4>With regards to the imminent completion of the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway, what impact does the Ministry hope to see from increased regional integration?</h4><p>The joint venture of the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway project by Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey has begun and is currently in full swing. The construction of a 101-kilometer section required to connect the Trans-Europe and Trans-Asia railway networks to the South Caucasus railway system will enable cargo and passenger transportation from China through Central Asia and from the South Caucasus to the EU. The full operational capacity of the transport corridors passing through Azerbaijan will necessitate joining the Convention concerning International Carriage by Rail and becoming a member of its intergovernmental organization. As a link enhancing the importance of the Transport Corridor Europe-Caucasus-Asia (TRACECA), the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway project will also expand the transit potential of regional countries, accelerate the process of integration into the EU, facilitate cooperation within the framework of the European Neighborhood policy, and contribute to the development of Azerbaijan's foreign economic relations.</p><h4>What is being done to improve the quality and efficiency of public transport, both in Baku and in the provinces?</h4><p>In order to improve the quality of public transport, an international bus terminal meeting modern standards has been built in Baku. New bus stations have been built in 14 district centers. Existing bus stations have been renovated and commissioned in seven other district centers. A total of 2,720 large- and medium-sized modern passenger buses have been brought to Azerbaijan in the last five years in an effort to improve the quality of inter-city, intra-urban, and international passenger transport, ensuring safety and reducing traffic congestion. A total of 400 out of 750 transport vehicles for inter-city bus services, 2,100 out of 3,000 vehicles for intra-urban services in Baku, 20 out of 90 transport vehicles for inter-city bus services, 100 out of 400 transport vehicles for intra-urban services in Ganja, 20 out of 90 transport vehicles for inter-city bus services, and 80 out of 650 vehicles required for intra-urban services in Sumgait have been replaced. In order to improve the quality of the taxi service in Baku, 543 London taxis and other cabs have been purchased. The number of London taxis is expected to increase to 3,000. A total of 65 taxi stands have been established throughout the capital. Measures have also been taken to improve the quality of the bus service in Baku, such as the establishment of 617 new bus stops. An intelligent transport management center has been built and commissioned in the city of Baku.</p><h4>What challenges does Azerbaijan face in becoming a regional transport hub, and how is the Ministry addressing these?</h4><p>The fact that the TRACECA and North-South international transport corridors converge on Azerbaijan has led to the emergence of an important transport hub in Eurasia and has required the creation of a necessary transport infrastructure. Some of the most important infrastructure projects we have undertaken include the reconstruction of a highway and a railway line from Baku to the Georgian border on the basis of the latest technologies in order to accelerate the speed of traffic and improve road safety, the construction of a new international seaport and creation of an international logistical center in the Alat settlement where both corridors converge, the purchase of new ferries with a capacity of 52 railway carriages in order to eliminate any physical barriers, the simplification of border clearance procedures through the introduction of a “one window" principle, and the commissioning of six international airports throughout the country.</p><h4>More than $140 million of the state budget has been allocated to the Ministry for 2013. What are some of the main projects that will be funded by this?</h4><p>In general, the funds allocated from the state budget and other specific funds finance the construction and maintenance of motor roads, road junctions, tunnels, pedestrian subways, and other facilities, the implementation of various road transport projects including maintenance and repair, and the reconstruction of roads that are on the Ministry's balance sheet. Large-scale projects are mainly implemented with loans and financial support from international financial institutions.</p><h4>What is the long-term vision of the Ministry?</h4><p>The proposals on future development directions with a view to resolving some of the outstanding problems with the organization of passenger and cargo transport and ensuring better coordination among various transport agencies in international transportation are as follows: to establish educational institutions to train qualified drivers in line with international standards; supply institutions with the necessary equipment and develop modern training programs; to optimize the bus service within district areas and between villages; and to continue work on the construction of new bus stations and the reconstruction of existing ones. In order to eliminate traffic congestion in the main cities of the Republic (Baku, Ganja, and Sumgait), we need to identify areas suitable for car parks at the entrance to the cities and elsewhere, to expand radial streets and avenues and build new radial roads in the newly reconstructed parts of the city, to introduce a light high-speed railway service, to apply new technology in order to ensure the transparent operation of the transport sector, to build alternative high-speed and fee-based roads along the North-South and East-West international transport corridors, to build a new highway linking Guba and Shamakhi districts, and to continue work on replacing the sand and gravel roads in the Republic with asphalt-concrete roads.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-need-to-evolve]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the evolution of the higher education system in Colombia?</h4><p>The tertiary education system in Colombia, like that of a number of other Latin American countries, places special emphasis on the social sciences. That means that the level of specialization in technical programs is slightly lower. In my opinion, the sector must shift its focus of attention toward the current needs of the country: applied sciences and the professions. Colombia lacks a strong and large road infrastructure network, and therefore we must strengthen engineering programs across the country in order to make Colombian companies more competitive. In addition, we should boost technological research.</p><h4>What are UNAL's curricular strengths?</h4><p>We are highly recognized for our medical studies, although we currently lack a university hospital where students can carry out research. Also, we have a very good reputation in terms of engineering programs and we are one of the only higher education centers in the country that offers high-standard programs for basic sciences: mathematics, biology, and statistics, to name a few. Our alumni in these areas are well-known throughout the country. Therefore, I believe that UNAL plays a more important role in the sciences field as compared to other higher education institutions in the country. Additionally, the university has high levels of penetration in bordering urban centers such as San Andrés, Tumaco, and Arauca. The university has a very strong presence outside of Bogotá, and that's a clear differentiating factor. However, I believe that the national government should boost the arrival of students from rural Colombia to the main cities through a more extensive scholarship program. Overall, our institution plays a key social role in bringing higher education closer to some strata of society. In this regard, our university currently has 40,000 undergraduate students. In fact, we have 8,000 students in our several post-graduate programs. In addition, our institution trains around 40% of the country's PhD candidates, and we have been a pioneer center in this field—we were the first university offering PhD programs back in 1986. We have also played a very important role in training professors for doctoral programs at the national level, and I would even say that we set many national standards in this field.</p><div class="quote">“We must strengthen engineering programs across the country in order to make Colombian companies more competitive."</div><h4>How much can students expect to pay in tuition fees?</h4><p>The cost of the tuition fees for undergraduate programs is linked to the family income of every particular student, and also their subject of study—whether it be engineering, social sciences, or humanities. Overall, costs can vary from Ps100,000 to Ps4 million per semester. In terms of post-graduate courses, tuition fees are the same.</p><h4>How significant are relations with companies from the private sector in offering training opportunities in the field?</h4><p>This is one of our weaknesses as compared to other universities. Over the years, we have introduced training opportunities for our students in terms of accepting work experience for thesis and final project purposes. However, it is not very common for our students to take up such opportunities. I believe that other institutions have a stronger focus on how to better position their students in the professional market, whereas our institution primarily focuses on their training and the education process. That is something we aim to change in the near future.</p><h4>What role does research play in the university?</h4><p>We have a very strong focus on research. For example, research in the field receives the largest amount of funding from our budget. The budget is primarily focused on providing funding opportunities for our students. At the same time, we also develop co-research programs with other institutions such as Banco de la República and Colciencias. In addition, we facilitate professors' mobility through several initiatives in order to boost know-how transfer. Also, we sponsor many events at the national level in the cultural, scientific, and educational fields.</p><h4>How many scholarships did UNAL grant its students in 2012?</h4><p>At the post-graduate level, we awarded 250 scholarships for MA and PhD students to support their studies. This line of scholarships can be renewed every year. We also have a scholarship program for assistant professors, as well as to cover studying material costs and fees.</p><h4>How many foreign students does UNAL currently have, and how are your exchange programs evolving?</h4><p>Over the last two years, Colombia in general, and our university in particular, has seen an increase in the number of international students. For example, we receive an average of 100 students from abroad each semester. They come from Mexico, Germany, Norway, Spain, Argentina, and France, among other countries. However, in the last few years, we have also seen a very important increase in the number of local students going abroad, and we are sending an average of 170 students to other countries each semester. These are figures from our undergraduate programs. In terms of post-graduate studies, we receive an average of 50 students per semester.</p><h4>How significant are international partnerships with other universities for UNAL?</h4><p>We have a very large network of agreements with other institutions at the international level from many countries. For example, we have very strong ties with Latin American institutions, because we believe that it is very important to boost know-how transfer through student- and professor-exchange programs. In this regard, we have agreements with important Latin American institutions such as USP from Brazil, UBA from Argentina, and UNAM from Mexico. At the same time, we have partnership agreements with many universities in Europe, such as Universidad de Valencia and Universidad Complutense de Madrid, as well as several polytechnic institutions in France and Italy.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of Grupo Hermes?</h4><p>We started as a family company, and in 1978 we became a holding. We began with the manufacture and assembly of trucks, and then we moved into energy generators, which is the second most important business at Grupo Hermes, our industrial branch. Grupo Hermes later entered into the construction and operation of infrastructure: highways, dams, water treatment facilities, hospitals, and museums.</p><h4>How have your individual groups been growing, and what has been Grupo Hermes' growth strategy?</h4><p>Grupo Hermes has four divisions: infrastructure, energy, transport, and tourism. What has given Grupo Hermes a strong position is its ability to specialize in each of the sectors in which it participates, and to focus on contributing to Mexico's growth through developing key infrastructure. We now have a presence in the most important states and cities in Mexico, having built more than 500 kilometers of highways and 13,600 meters of high-specification tunnels in some of the most challenging projects in the country. We have had a major presence in the international market since 2005 in the energy sector, and we were recently awarded a $148 million project for energy generation in Saudi Arabia by the Sadara Chemical Company. The whole project is the largest petrochemical plant in the world built in one stage, worth $20 billion. We will be supplying four steam energy generators. Each one is as tall as a five-story building. We have started to assemble everything in Mexico, and ship the units to Saudi Arabia. In fact, the first two were shipped on January 2013. Grupo Hermes has been selling to Saudi Arabia for a while, and it has been quite successful so far. We have already developed more than 10 projects there. Ours is a very cyclical business, so it changes a lot and we must be ready for the good times and the bad. We have been developing our own technology and we have joint ventures with a number of highly prestigious international companies. By developing our own technology, we have become largely self-sufficient.</p><div class="quote">“I am convinced that PPPs are the development scheme of the future."</div><h4>How have you been diversifying your business operations?</h4><p>We began the construction company more than three decades ago, and now it has a lot of expertise in water-related businesses, such as dams and waterwheels. We also specialize in highways. Grupo Hermes owns and operates several highways and bridges in the country. We see a lot of potential in roads, because Mexico has a huge need for new infrastructure if it wants to regain competitiveness vis-á-vis other emerging economies. Recently, the association between the public and private sector in schemes such as public-private partnerships (PPPs) has been going well, and we have carried out some construction projects for the government. Usually, we finance everything so we own and operate our own roads; after 20-30 years we give them back to the government. I am confident that this is the way Mexico will go in the future. For our latest highway, Durango-Mazatlán, we worked in alliance with a Spanish company to develop a project the government had wanted to do for 20 years. However, it was very expensive and difficult because it had to cross one of the major mountain ranges in our country, the Sierra Madre. It is almost complete now, and has been one of the biggest challenges we have faced. We are also building a large dam in Central Mexico called El Zapotillo to supply water to more than 2 million people in the cities of Guadalajara and León. There is a lot of potential and we are well equipped to compete. We are well positioned to associate ourselves with international companies to develop infrastructure in the country.</p><h4>Will PPPs become increasingly important for companies like Grupo Hermes?</h4><p>I am convinced that PPPs are the development scheme of the future. We have some projects, such as large roads, being financed by Mexican institutions. We also have Spanish and Mexican companies that provide the financing, buildings, and operations. The projects that are built by the government just need reliable construction companies. Then there are some projects that need construction, financing, and operations. We can contribute in all these areas. We offer integral solutions through PPPs. This model has a lot of potential. So far, we Mexicans have been investing about half of what we should in much needed infrastructure. Under the Calderón administration, PPPs were most important, and that will continue on to the next government. Our financial situation is much better in Mexico now. The US and EU are facing many deficit problems, but Mexico had its problems in 1994 and 1995. We have learned from those challenges and strengthened the fundamentals of our economy. In Mexico, the public deficit is very small, the commercial balance is still positive, our institutions are strong, so we are in good shape to grow. There is a lot of money in the world, and we are able and ready to attract investments. Brazil has been successful and now it is our turn. I am optimistic that the situation in Mexico is very positive.</p><h4>What about Interacciones Financial Group?</h4><p>In parallel to the growth of Grupo Hermes, we saw the opportunity to enter the financial sector and the need to finance infrastructure, and as a result created Grupo Financiero Interacciones. In 1966 we started as a small insurance company. In 1993 we started to operate a bank, which today is the third largest Mexican financial group. This year we are celebrating its 20th anniversary. The financial group is composed of four divisions; banking, brokerage, insurance, and investment funds. We have successfully positioned ourselves as the largest specialized bank in Mexico, focused on the financing of infrastructure for states and municipalities. This is our niche and there is great demand for funds in the subnational market. We have a clear competitive advantage; we know the country, we know its needs, we know who to talk to, and we know how to deal with local legislation and other regulations. Project financing is one of the solutions we offer to serve our clients. In Mexico, Interacciones can be a perfect partner for international companies willing to finance and develop infrastructure projects. We are the clear leaders in the financing of government projects. Total assets for the financial group have grown from $540 million in 2003 to more than $8 billion in 2011.</p><h4>You have successfully bid for work in Saudi Arabia. How easy is it for Mexican companies to compete in Middle Eastern markets?</h4><p>It is all a matter of being competitive. You begin by finding small windows of opportunity and doing things better and better. First, we started selling small energy generators to Chile, and continued selling small energy generators to Saudi Arabia. That was the case for us 12 years ago. It becomes a small world. We are probably one of only 10 producers of those generators globally. Slowly, people begin trusting your products. They buy small products at first, then medium ones, and so on. There is fierce competition from the South Koreans, the Indians, and the Italians, and we probably end up winning 10% of what we bid on—mainly key strategic projects. With our technology, sometimes we have to be innovative to meet the special needs of our customers. For example, there is one company in Canada that wants to use tree bark as a combustible material, so it asked for our help and we came up with a solution. It is a completely different generator than the one that runs with coal or gasoline; however, we were able to find the best solution. It's good to get to know the market, but also good to get to know your products, and we have also the ability to develop the technology to face these new challenges.</p><h4>What kind of initiatives does Grupo Hermes have in place to reduce carbon emissions and improve sustainability?</h4><p>Grupo Hermes is a leader in the reduction of carbon emissions and sustainability. When we started selling to Saudi Arabia, we had to sell products that were better for the atmosphere. Saudi Arabian standards were higher than in Mexico, so now we are way ahead of the competition because we have been supplying to very strict companies. Now that governments are imposing stricter regulations, we are very well positioned. We were born as a company facing tough challenges, and we have learned how to deal with them.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did Yıldırım Group grow from a small family company in Samsun to a global Turkish brand?</h4><p><span class="red"><strong>ALP MALAZGİRT</strong></span> The company started in the 1960s in the trading business in Samsun, buying and selling construction materials. It continued in trading for about 30 years. In the 1990s, it then moved into the coal trade. The year 1993 was very significant, because it was the first time that the coal trade kicked off regionally. Coincidentally, 1989 is when the Berlin Wall fell and Russia started privatizing all its state-owned enterprises. Back then, only about 5% of all businesses in Russia were private. By 1994, in five years, this huge country had privatized about 90% of all its enterprises. During this time, many minerals, such as coal, became more available for export.</p><h4>How did the company's strategy change in 1993 with the inclusion of the coal business?</h4><p><span class="red"><strong>EVREN ÖZTÜRK</strong></span> The company's aim from that point was to become the largest coal trader in Turkey. We brought the coal from Russia, and we set up a joint venture with the Russians in Turkey to distribute it. At the same time, we had our own coal facilities locally. That business also grew through vertical integration. In around 2003, Turkey started privatizing, so we halted the joint venture because the Russians had started doing business in Turkey on their own. It was at that point that we bought Eti Krom and Gemlik Gübre, making this an industrial company. From there the acquisitions continued, and that's how we became such a fast-growing enterprise.</p><div class="quote">“Our identity is Turkish, but our business is global."</div><p><span class="red"><strong>MUSTAFA KEMAL ERKANAT</strong></span> Robert Yıldırım believed in the importance of two things for the business. The first one was foreign trade. The second one was an inorganic growth strategy, rather than greenfield investment, which takes much longer. Our strategy was, and is, that inorganic growth can provide a more rapid return on investment. Robert also believed that, in the long run, base metal companies would become much more profitable than oil companies. Now we know that this is the case, with companies like Rio Tinto and Vale doing much better than companies like BP.</p><p><span class="red"><strong>ALP MALAZGİRT</strong></span> The theme at this time was flexibility. Initially, Robert started doing business in Russia, but as soon as other people started getting into the field and crowding in, he moved to China. He had the flexibility to fold up his tent and go somewhere else to set up shop all over again. He's very entrepreneurial and hard working, with a lot of perseverance. When he went to China, the focus again was coal. Then, after a few years, we changed focus again, and now we're getting the coal from South Africa, through Mozambique.</p><p><span class="red"><strong>EVREN ÖZTURK</strong></span> The focus was also on related industries. We moved from coal to bulk carriers to shipping. Then in 2004, when a lot of chemical tankers were being bought and sold, we got into building tankers. We built the Marmara Shipyard and now we build and sell our own tankers, both externally and to our shipping company. From there, we went into our first maritime port investments.</p><p><strong><span class="red">ROBERT YÜKSEL</span> </strong><span class="red"><strong>YILDIRIM</strong></span> When I came back to Turkey from the US in 1993, my family business was trading construction products and coal. My background up until that point was in high-tech industries in Silicon Valley, and I wondered how I could contribute my skills to our very low-tech family business. I decided to use my English skills and my international business experience to focus on our foreign trading operations. I focused on the coal business, which was changing at the time because Turkey was changing its coal-use habits. The first thing I did was travel to Siberia to meet with Russian coal producers and traders. I saw a lot of opportunities in Russia at that time. I used my experience with international business ethics from the Americans and Japanese and, as a result, the Russians liked my style of conducting business and socializing. This allowed me to present myself as an insider in the Russian coal sector and gave me an advantage over other Turkish companies that were entering it. I learned from this experience that I have a talent for foreign trade, and we took advantage of that to expand into other products.</p><h4>What advantages does your vertically integrated strategy provide?</h4><p><span class="red"><strong>MUSTAFA KEMAL ERKANAT</strong></span> One of our main advantages is the synergy between our businesses. Our operational excellence comes from not just operating the port, but knowing how to deliver the goods with ships and how to get the goods to the port with trucks. All that synergy helps us because we know our businesses from the customer side as well. That makes us somewhat unique. We have attracted a very international team, and I think because of our strong management we will continue to attract more. When people see a good thing, it spreads.</p><h4>How has the international perception of Turkish business changed over the time Yıldırım has been operating abroad?</h4><p><span class="red"><strong>ALP MALAZGİRT</strong></span> In Asia, the perception has changed a lot. Turkey is now becoming a country that a lot of people are looking up to, especially in East Asia. In some Muslim countries like Indonesia, they look up to Turkey. In Central Asia, there are a lot of Turkish companies operating, first in the construction sector and later in the consumer sector. So, clearly, the perception has changed in the East.</p><p><span class="red"><strong>SEAN PIERCE</strong></span> From an American perspective, I don't think I had a perception of Turkey before I came here. Now, what I see is a real duality; the difference between the skyscrapers we see around us, and what is down at street level.</p><p><span class="red"><strong>EVREN ÖZTÜRK</strong></span> In 2011, when we were seeking finance for the acquisition of Malta Freeport, we had a lot of issues because we are Turkish. There was a reluctance on the part of finance providers. Even though Fitch has raised Turkey's rating to investment grade, we are still two or three notches lower according to S&amp;P.</p><p><span class="red"><strong>MUSTAFA KEMAL ERKANAT</strong></span> With Turkish companies abroad, we are like the crusaders. Europe hasn't accepted us at first, but as companies like ours become more intertwined in the EU economy, we will change Europe's perception from the inside and they will accept us in the end. If Turkish companies like ours do such a good job internationally, we will attract investors to Turkey. Our policies go along with Turkish government policies. For example, we are expanding our business in Africa at the same time as Turkey is expanding its influence in Africa. That will bring further investment into Turkey.</p><p><span class="red"><strong>ÖZER ÖZ</strong></span> Turkey's perception is all about duality. If you're looking at it from the East, Turkey is a Western country. If you're looking at it from the West, Turkey is still an Eastern country.</p><h4>How would you rank Turkey as a base of operations for an international business?</h4><p><span class="red"><strong>ÖZER ÖZ</strong></span> In some business areas Turkey is very attractive, because it is a hub for transportation between East and West. It is an energy corridor. We have a young population, which makes it attractive to retail investors. Turkey also has its shortcomings, because energy is very expensive here, and we don't have much mining. On the other hand, Turkey offers a young and educated population, so we have something to export. For health care, Turkey is a great place and we are attracting healthcare investment. It is a duality and there are a lot of parameters.</p><p><strong><span class="red">ROBERT YÜKSEL</span> </strong><span class="red"><strong>YILDIRIM</strong></span> Turkey is between the East and West, but it is more Western. Turkey is in the top 20 economies globally. We are advanced and we are changing, and the new target—to be in the top 10—is extremely difficult, but it is maybe doable in the next 20 years. Turkey deserves more than what it gets right now. If we had some of the opportunities that are given to European countries, we would be in much better shape. Look at Greece and Portugal and countries in Central and Eastern Europe. But still, we are thankful that we don't have oil because oil can have negative effects. Because Turkey doesn't have oil it means we are hard working as we have had to build everything ourselves and we have all the top industries in Turkey. If you looked 20 years ago, the textile sector was very attractive in Turkey. Now the textile sector is behind other industries like automotive, which is now our largest export segment. Steel is improving. In cement, we are in the top five in the world. Mining is also developing. This is all about Turkish entrepreneurs. They used to take what they earned here and spend it outside of Turkey. Now they are re-investing it in Turkey more and more, and now investing it in Turkey and legally investing it in Europe, the US, Asia, and Africa. We now see more Turkish groups expanding abroad. As the Yıldırım Group, we are in France, Belgium, Sweden, and Malta—we are becoming a part of the EU economy. I think that business in Turkey today has more opportunities than in Europe. In Europe everything is planned and restricted—in Turkey we still have ups and downs. This diversity is what makes Turkey strong.</p><h4>What is your vision for Yıldırım Group a decade from now?</h4><p><strong><span class="red">ROBERT YÜKSEL</span> </strong><span class="red"><strong>YILDIRIM</strong></span> Our intention is to be a pure Turkish company in the global arena. We don't want our boundaries to be Turkey's boundaries. Our identity is Turkish, but our business is global. We need to create international Turkish brands in business. Of course, it is not easy to try to become Turkey's Vale, but we can be a multi-industry group. We can aim to be among the top-20 port operators in the world. And in mining we want to be healthy and making money globally. Our Turkish identity is going to Africa and Latin America and then making the company international, with a head office in Istanbul, but offices and operations everywhere. We want to be less family oriented and more corporate oriented—to be an international company with international partners in major businesses.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your general outlook for Ecuador and the oil and gas industry for 2013?</h4><p>Within the difficult economic context at the international level, in which the EU and US economies are having problems restarting, Latin America represents a positive island. Overall, Latin America is growing faster than its peers as well as representing large consumer markets of its own. In particular, Ecuador offers many opportunities because it has numerous national sectors that have yet to be fully exploited and others that have room for further development. Therefore, the country holds unique economic potential. In terms of its oil and gas sector, I think that Latin America is rapidly developing. The new contracts provided much needed stability to the sector by laying down the foundations for the development of the industry, especially in terms of equipment and infrastructure. At the same time, I think that in 2013 we will see new developments thanks to the tendering processes that took place in 2012, which should be awarded in the second half of 2013. We have to keep in mind that the oil and gas industry is key for the Ecuadorean economy. Therefore, Repsol plays a very important role in the development of the sector, and we are open to further involving ourselves in different fields of the industry.</p><h4>What are Repsol's current production figures in Ecuador?</h4><p>At the moment, we produce 45,000 barrels a day, about 5,000 barrels more than expected due to the recent addition of a well in the AMO area in Block 16 of the Amazon region. In the future, we might increase our production figures depending on the declaration of the tendering processes. Such decisions will clearly mark the future developments of the company, and we will focus our business strategy according to those resolutions in the latter part of 2013.</p><div class="quote">“We do not see any company as a competitor, but as a partner for the development of the industry in Ecuador."</div><h4>What are some of the main activities Repsol currently implements in terms of social responsibility?</h4><p>We have been developing a collaboration agreement for the last two decades with the communities that are close to our in-field operations. Overall, I would describe those relationships as perfect and long lasting. We are fully aware of their concerns and needs, and that is why Repsol does everything it can to make sure that we contribute to community development.</p><h4>How was Repsol's performance in 2012, and what are the company's priorities for the next few years?</h4><p>We signed a national contract in 2010, which will expire in 2018. Therefore, at the moment our activities are framed in that agreement. We committed ourselves to invest around $300 million, and I have to say that in only two years we have already invested $180 million. However, we are currently holding talks with the government to look into ways to expand our collaboration until 2021 and further invest in our activities around the production area.</p><h4>How would the entry of new competitors impact the sector?</h4><p>We do not see any company as a competitor, but as a partner for the development of the industry in Ecuador. Therefore, we would welcome more foreign players in the industry, because we believe that by working together as part of a consortium, Ecuador will further develop in the future.</p><h4>The sector is expected to grow 5% in 2013. What that would mean for Repsol's activities in the country?</h4><p>I believe that the development of the sector depends on new fields. Repsol is currently negotiating with the government for exploration rights in one such field. The current field we are exploiting, Block 16, is a very mature field that will naturally decrease in terms of production figures. Therefore, we support the exploration of new fields, and as an internationally recognized company we can provide expertise in many areas.</p><h4>What are some of the greatest opportunities the oil and gas sector offers to international investors?</h4><p>For foreign companies aiming to establish operations in Ecuador, the current legal framework provides the best tools to sign business agreements with national companies in order to start operating in the country. Ecuador is a country of opportunities, and in terms of the oil and gas industry, the current potential is within the fields that are being exploited. I have to say that the national companies here in Ecuador are very willing to cooperate with their foreign counterparts as a way to contributing to the transfer of knowledge, expertise, and technology. Business partnerships are always win-win situations for all the parties involved.</p><h4>Who are the main partners of Repsol in Ecuador?</h4><p>Currently, Repsol operates in Ecuador's Block 16 and the Tivacuno oil field, and these contracts expire in 2018. We hold a 35% share in the consortium operating the blocks, and we are the operator. Our other partners are China's Tiptop Energy Ltd, a subsidiary of Sinopec, with 20%; Taiwan's Opic, with 31%; and China's Sinochem, with 14%.</p><h4>Since you took over two years ago, what is your general vision for the development of Repsol in Ecuador?</h4><p>Ecuador has long been producing around 500,000 barrels a day, and the government has ambitious plans for the sector with the development of the Refinery of the Pacific. This will contribute to decrease the overall number of imports of petroleum-derived products. However, for that to become a reality the country needs to raise production figures by improving currently exploited fields, as well as increase the exploration of new areas. Ecuador definitely holds a huge potential within the oil and gas industry. Repsol is committed to the development of the industry and the country, and we are also ready to take on any new activities in the country. Repsol aims at increasing production figures through new fields and investments.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-voice-among-many]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the core of Mexico's foreign policy and how has the secretariat been working to make Mexico's voice heard amongst multilateral institutions and organizations worldwide?</h4><p>Mexico's foreign policy is guided by a firm belief of the country's right to self determination. Within this basic premise, our foreign policy has been guided by the protection of human rights, free trade, and the pursuit of global solutions to global problems. Because of our history, culture, and geography, Mexico has always been a country open to the outside world. We firmly believe that our integration with the rest of the world will translate into higher welfare for our citizens. Mexico has 13 free trade agreements (FTAs) in force, giving us privileged access to 44 different countries. Our foreign trade in 2012 reached a record $740 billion, accounting for two-thirds of our GDP. This is not random; it is a consequence of a shift in our economy in the past 20 years, which has moved from an oil-dependent, import-substitution scheme to an open market in which manufacturing accounts for over 80% or our total exports. I firmly believe that our foreign policy should work toward the creation of new economic opportunities, and we are working steadily on different fronts. We are in negotiations to build a free trade area with Chile, Colombia, and Peru within the Pacific Alliance. The Pacific Alliance will be a regional platform to promote closer ties with the South Pacific area. Mexico has been participating in the negotiations of the Trans-Pacific Partnership since October 2012. We have been extremely successful in achieving increasing trade volumes with our North American partners. We are also ready to seek new opportunities in those markets in which we have a limited exchange, but that will certainly drive the shape of the world economy in the following decades. Mexico has always been a strong advocate of international institutions as facilitators of global dialogue. Our strength in multilateral institutions derives, I believe, from our non-ideological approach and our desire to be pragmatic and consensus building. It is also derived from our willingness to shoulder our share of responsibility in global governance. Some recent examples are our participation in the UN Security Council in 2009-2010, the hosting of the UN Climate Change Conference in 2010, and the G20 chairmanship during 2012.</p><h4>In what ways will the new administration be pursuing a more modern and pro-active approach to foreign policy?</h4><p>President Peña Nieto established five clear axes for his government: security, education, prosperity, inclusiveness, and global responsibility. The fifth component, ensuring that Mexico acts with responsibility in the global arena, falls squarely in the realm of foreign policy. It calls for Mexico to be an active participant in finding solutions to short-, medium-, and long-term global challenges. It implies that in the bilateral, regional, and multilateral arenas, Mexico's positions must be in accordance with the search for a better world for all. Our foreign policy, however, goes beyond being a responsible global actor. In fact, foreign policy must be geared toward the achievement of all five axes of government and not only the last one. To that end, we foresee four main pillars for our foreign policy strategy: our bilateral, regional, and multilateral policies; our overseas development assistance policies; our policies to promote Mexico in the economic, cultural, and tourism arenas; and our policies aimed at protecting Mexicans and Mexican interests outside of our territory. As I mentioned above, our foreign policy must leverage our domestic policies. Our offices abroad will be extremely useful in achieving our goal. Mexico has the largest network of consulates in the US; actually, it is the largest consular network that any country has in another single nation: 50 offices spread from Anchorage to San Diego, and from San Juan to Boston. We also have 75 embassies and 16 consulates distributed throughout the world. President Peña Nieto recently addressed our diplomatic corps and instructed ambassadors and consuls to get directly involved in this institutional effort to promote Mexico as a destination for business and travel. The goal is to engage our diplomats in regular actions of public diplomacy that reach wider audiences. As head of the Secretariat, I will personally coordinate this endeavor, which I am sure will be successful in the medium term. On a parallel track, we are committed to the adoption of increasing actions toward cooperation for development. The Mexican government recently set up its own Agency for International Development, which has proved of tremendous help in coordinating the international aid that Mexico offers to third-party countries. We have taken part in different projects throughout Central America and the Caribbean, in which Mexico has financed or offered technical support in the design and implementation of several programs. These include constructing hospitals and markets in Haiti, supplying electricity to our partners in Guatemala and Honduras, and modernizing border crossings in Panama and Costa Rica. We strongly believe that as Mexico's economy grows, we must help our neighbors and friends bring about further opportunities for development.</p><div class="quote">“Mexico's foreign policy is guided by a firm belief of the country's right to self determination."</div><h4>Securing a framework for legal and safe immigration to the US remains a key issue for Mexico. How do you expect to see Mexico's relationship with the US evolve over the coming years?</h4><p>In the coming years we will see our countries continue to act as responsible partners. Beyond our bilateral agenda, we realize that working together will help each government achieve our respective domestic priorities, such as job creation. I am certain that we will continue to develop and implement joint views on areas of common interest; for instance, on border management, scientific innovation, and environmental protection. We support an open and inclusive international economic system, and will work alongside our Canadian and US partners to enhance North America's competitiveness. The US and Mexico currently trade over $1.2 billion every day, and we are the first or second foreign market for 22 of the 50 US states. Yet, there are still many opportunities for growth. One of the important issues is immigration. We respectfully promote an informed discussion of the many dimensions of this subject, from family reunification concerns to economic variables. Our legal frameworks should reflect the region's demographic realities. Mexico remains committed to supporting the wellbeing of its citizens abroad, and this is a central concern of President Peña Nieto's administration.</p><h4>How do you believe the Pacific Alliance will increase free trade and economic integration?</h4><p>We must take into account that the four member countries of the Pacific Alliance have some common features. All four have investment-grade markets; they are open economies, outward looking, and are keen to diversify their trade and economic partnerships. All four of them have FTAs with the US. The allied countries combined represent a population of 200 million, 50% of Latin America's imports and exports, and over 34% of the region's GDP. Taken together, the Pacific Alliance represents the world's ninth largest economy. The Alliance receives 41% of foreign investment directed to Latin America. The Pacific Alliance will go far beyond free trade because it seeks an integration that allows the free flow of goods, services, investments, and people. On the trade side, the Pacific Alliance will seek to eliminate all import duties between member countries by the end of 2013. We also want to move on to more ambitious goals. We are working together to enhance our links with Asia, the world's most dynamic region. The key stated objectives of the Pacific Alliance include increased trade with Asia, especially with the 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The Pacific Alliance makes sense as no Latin American country on its own—even the largest ones, like Mexico—has the export capacity to single-handedly supply manufactured goods to Asia's giant markets. If Latin American countries want to sell cars, refrigerators, or shoes to Asia, they will have to create joint production chains and negotiate joint trade deals. This is a relevant goal that the Pacific Alliance is facing. The four countries are building a new framework with common rules of origin and trade facilitation in order to enhance productive integration. Also, the Pacific Alliance will establish joint export promotion offices in Asian countries. Finally, Chile, Peru, and Mexico are also involved in other relevant processes with Asian countries, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which is being negotiated between the US, Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam. Colombia will follow shortly. The TPP is a comprehensive and high-standard FTA negotiation process. It will liberalize trade in nearly all goods and services to include commitments beyond those currently established by the WTO. When implemented, the TPP will eliminate tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade and investment among the parties, serving as a template for a future trade pact among APEC members and potentially other countries.</p><h4>How important are collaborative efforts between Mexico and other Central American countries to the strength of the region, and what initiatives are you undertaking to improve relations?</h4><p>Central America and the Caribbean region are of the utmost priority for Mexico's presence abroad. Historical, social, and economic ties link Mexico to the region and, therefore, Mexico has assumed its political commitment to be an important player in all cooperation and development issues in the region. Our countries share common challenges, and we can also find joint solutions if we work together under a framework of mutual responsibility. Certainly, much of the focus has shifted lately to security and immigration issues, but there is a large threshold of opportunity in the economic, social, and development fields that should be reinforced and promoted. As an example, since 2008, under Mexican leadership, the Mesoamerica Project unites 10 countries (Guatemala, El Salvador, Belize, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panamá, the Dominican Republic, Colombia, and Mexico). The purpose of this mechanism is not to create a new bureaucratic body but a platform to find solutions in eight main areas of action. Moreover, in 2011, during the last Tuxtla Summit, Mexico set up the Yucatán Fund, which provides resources through innovative financial schemes to support the development and integration strategy in the region. With an initial endowment of $160 million, Mexico was able to provide resources to three infrastructure projects in Honduras, Nicaragua, and Belize. The current portfolio presented by the Mesoamerican countries is increasing and Mexico will continue its financial and technical support as long as the projects fulfill two requirements: they must have a strong social impact, and they should also consider a regional spillover of benefits. Mexico wants to become a beacon in the cooperation for development field in the region. We are committed to sharing our best practices and institutional development experiences with those countries that share common problems with us. And we are also working in more traditional cooperation stages; for instance, we want to increase the number of grants and scholarships for Mesoamerican students to come and study in Mexico.</p><h4>What impact did the G20 event have on Mexico's profile in the region, and what conclusions were reached as a result of the meeting?</h4><p>I would like to highlight that two important meetings took place in Los Cabos last year under Mexico's G20 presidency: a G20 informal meeting of Ministers of Foreign Affairs, on 19-20 February, and the G20 Leaders' Summit, on 18-19 June. The informal meeting of Ministers of Foreign Affairs, the first of its kind in the context of a chairmanship of the G20, was designed to draw on G20 foreign ministers' multilateral experience and global vision. It intended to explore the ways in which G20 member countries could contribute more effectively to addressing key challenges in global governance. The meeting fostered a constructive and open dialogue on enhancing policy coordination and coherence to improve global governance. The agreements made in the Los Cabos Leaders Summit cut across all the priorities Mexico championed during its presidency: to restore economic stability and growth, to strengthen the financial system and expand financial inclusion, to improve the global financial architecture, to enhance food security and address commodity price volatility, and to promote sustainable development, green growth, and the fight against climate change. The G20 summit reached a significant agreement for the global economy, ensuring an increase in the financial resources available to the IMF of over $450 billion, which doubles the capacity of the IMF to make available loans to countries in need. This is the largest expansion of resources that this institution has ever had, essential for dealing with times of global economic crisis. The Los Cabos Action Plan for Growth and Jobs adopted by G20 Leaders set out specific commitments on fiscal, monetary, and structural issues to secure global financial stability, strengthen global demand, and procure economic growth. The leaders agreed to extend the commitment not to implement further protectionist measures until 2014. This is a significant achievement, given that since the Toronto Summit in 2010, the G20 had not been able to agree to extend this political commitment beyond 2013. I believe the G20 Mexican presidency has helped enhance our country's role both regionally and globally. We are still playing a very active role in the G20 under the Russian presidency. As members of the G20 Troika, along with Russia and Australia, we continue providing strategic guidance to the works of the group and support the Russian presidency's outreach dialogue strategy.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2013?</h4><p>I am very optimistic about Mexico's potential for this year. Our macroeconomic stability, strong institutions, and dynamic private sector place us in a most favorable spot to take advantage of both internal and external opportunities. Even though this year will likely still be marked by the legacy of the economic downturn of 2009-2010, a period of increased global stability looks more likely than not. There are of course still challenges ahead and we should all work to ward them off. The US' long-term solution to its fiscal challenges and the stability of the eurozone are still the main sources of potential risk. However, progress has been made on both fronts. Authorities in the US are keenly aware of what is at stake and Congress and the administration are working together to reach a lasting solution. Along the same lines, the European Commission and European Central Bank, as well as all national European governments, have been most responsible in taking appropriate action to contain the contagion from crisis countries. European leaders have proved with concrete actions that the European project remains worthy and alive. Mexico thus faces an external environment that can be supportive of reasonable economic growth rates in the coming years. The extent to which we take advantage of these conditions will be determined in part by our ability to resolve long-standing structural issues that have held back our potential. The signals we are seeing from different actors indicate that the right conditions can be found to advance.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Colombia's government approved a set of tax reforms late in 2012. How will this move the country toward prosperity and reduced inequality?</h4><p>The government has designed an innovative set of policies to achieve national prosperity by improving targeted social spending and stimulating formal job creation. This will result in a reduction of income inequality, which currently stands as one of the highest in the world. Specifically, the recently approved tax reforms generated a cut in almost half of non-wage labor costs. This will increase the competitiveness of labor-intensive sectors, which previously carried most of the burden of payroll taxes. As a result, estimates are that the reform will lead to the creation of about 1 million new formal jobs and an increase in the size of the formal sector by about 10 percentage points. Furthermore, the reforms introduced a progressive schedule for individual income taxation. The new scheme consists of the National Alternative Minimum Tax (IMAN) and the Simple Alternative Minimum Tax (IMAS). The new tax regime is designed to be paid by employees earning over $35,000 per year. At the same time, workers earning less than $17,000 per year will be exempt from paying this tax. This will generate a reduction of close to 2 percentage points in the Gini inequality index.</p><h4>At close to 10%, Colombia's unemployment rate is one of the highest in the region. How is the government addressing this issue?</h4><p>The unemployment rate has exhibited an important reduction in recent years. It currently stands at 9.6% as of December 2012, reaching the government's goal of a single-digit rate. This has been accompanied by lower unemployment rates for heads of households, which in December 2012 stood at 4.8%, the lowest level in five years. However, unemployment in Colombia is still higher than that of its Latin American peers, and informality and inequality continue to be a problem. As such, some key programs are being implemented in order to further reduce the unemployment rate and to improve the quality of existing jobs. On the one hand, the recently approved tax reform that reduces non-wage costs for firms will have a positive impact on formalization and therefore on improving the quality of jobs. On the other hand, the 2010 job creation and formalization law aims to decrease the barriers of entry into the formal sector by reducing the transaction costs of hiring workers that belong to vulnerable groups, such as unskilled workers, women above 40 years of age, displaced populations, and young workers, among others. The law gives tax incentives to firms hiring people from these groups. These measures will reduce the long-term unemployment rate and bring it closer to the regional average, which currently stands at about 7%.</p><div class="quote">“The goal of the current administration is to turn Colombia into a more competitive country with sustainable higher economic growth."</div><h4>The peso jumped 10% last year and over the past decade soared 65%, more than any other emerging market currency. What measures are being taken to weaken the peso?</h4><p>Over the last few years, there has been a real appreciation of the peso as a result of improved terms of trade, a larger volume of exports, and increased FDI. It is worth mentioning that this has been a worldwide phenomenon mainly derived from the weakening of the European and US economies. Thus, the behavior of the real exchange rate has been coherent with the dynamism of the Colombian economy as well as with worldwide economic trends. The expansion in the oil and mining sector's production has been a challenge for fiscal policy in order to prevent this boom from becoming a destabilizing factor in the economy. In that sense, the contribution of the royalties system reform and the adoption of a fiscal rule on central government finances will be key. They ensure that the cyclical revenue from increased oil and mining production will be saved, both by the national and sub-national governments, thereby mitigating the real exchange rate appreciation and the risks of deindustrialization generated by the competitiveness loss in the labor-intensive tradable sectors. The main policy response could be described as increased public saving, efforts to reduce foreign borrowing, and other measures to cut production costs for the other tradable sectors in the economy to improve their competitiveness. That is how a mandatory surcharge on electricity was removed, resulting in a reduction in the average cost of production of about 5%; a tariff reform was implemented to reduce the average nominal tariff from 12.4% to 6%. This implies a reduction in the cost of raw materials for the manufacturing and agricultural sectors. The government has also been working on the delicate balance of communicating adequately the different challenges the oil and mining industries face, to avoid unnecessary pessimism in a very dynamic economy but to allow agents to build informed expectations. The recent drop in coal prices is a good example of where agents should modify their expectations, which includes also the future exchange rate. On the other hand, the Central Bank recently extended the program for daily auctions to purchase foreign currency, through daily purchases of no less than $30 million until May of 2013. This represents an increase from $500 million in average monthly purchases under the previous program to no less than $750 million under the current one. In this way the country keeps cumulating international reserves to maintain the reserves-to-GDP ratio compatible with the country's financial depth and its growing participation in the global economy.</p><h4>What other strategic sectors besides mining, oil, and gas will lead growth in the coming years?</h4><p>The goal of the current administration is to turn Colombia into a more competitive country with sustainable higher economic growth, while increasing the wellbeing of the population. To fully achieve this goal, the government has developed the National Development Plan based on several key areas: globalization of the economy, infrastructure development, and access to better technology. On globalization, the government has implemented measures for the modernization and diversification of the economy through the signing of free trade agreements with the US, the eurozone, and several Asian economies. These trade agreements will increase the potential market of locally produced goods and will also enhance technology adoption and thereby productivity. We have also established a master plan for infrastructure that aims at the maintenance, rehabilitation, and development of the road network. Additionally, more than $20 billion is committed through public and private-public projects, which will substantially reduce the current infrastructure gap. Regarding innovation and technology, the government has increased the amount of resources allocated for science and technology, with the earmarking of 10% of total royalties for this specific purpose. This program aims to increase exports, create jobs, and train highly qualified labor. On the basis of these three components, we expect the high contributions of the agricultural, manufacturing, and services sectors will maintain Colombia's growth rates around 5% or higher over the next five years.</p><h4>How will Colombia take advantage of the current investment boom, and what measures will be introduced to further spur growth?</h4><p>The improvement of Colombia's macroeconomic and fiscal indicators has raised investor confidence in the country. Consequently, the Colombian investment rate has doubled over the last decade, reaching levels of 28% of GDP. This represents a record high and one of the top regional rates. Further evidence of this fact is the rise in FDI, which in 2012 reached a historical mark of more than $16 billion. This is a fundamental asset that will underpin the process of capital accumulation and the subsequent increase of the economy's potential GDP. The dynamics of the so-called economic engines will continue to foster growth. First of all, the agricultural sector will continue with its crop-renewal plans. Second, an ambitious infrastructure expansion program and the dynamics of housing construction will strengthen this area. Third, the mining sector will continue its expansion due to increasing FDI inflows, which have already yielded an oil production of 1 million barrels per day. Finally, the new royalties' distribution scheme has devoted large resources to science and technology, which will enhance the country's productivity. The macroeconomic and fiscal balance, the high investment rates, and continued growth in the economic engines will keep the Colombian economy on its dynamic path of recent years, with an output growth reaching its potential.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Colombia's economy in 2013 and beyond?</h4><p>The Colombian economy has achieved macroeconomic and fiscal balances, the most important pillars for building sustainable economic growth. Although the country is still exposed to a highly uncertain international environment, the economy rests on a solid foundation that permits countercyclical monetary and fiscal policies if external conditions worsen. On the supply side, economic growth during 2013 will rest on the dynamism of the financial, services, and mining sectors, which will grow at rates of around 5%. On the demand side, private and public consumption will play an important role. Households confidence continues at record levels, which guarantees that consumption will keep growing at high rates. On the public side, the implementation of the new royalty system, which will gain full steam during this year, will help stimulate demand in the public sector. In the medium term, we expect the Colombian economy to consolidate its position as the third largest economy in the region, with GDP tripling in size and output per capita doubling, thereby further raising current living standards while taking millions of citizens out of poverty. In 20 years we expect Colombia to be a fully developed, export-driven, and technology-generating economy with unemployment rates below 5%, an informal sector of less than 20% in size, and with equality levels comparable to those of OECD economies.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[hail-the-driver]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How large a role does cross-border passenger transport play in the business?</h4><p>The international segment represents 14% of the business. We are actually the only company in Mexico that provides transportation services within Mexico, the US, and cross border. That is related to how we receive permits from the Department of Homeland Security in the US. We have full insurance in the US for all of our units, and comply with both US and Mexican regulations.</p><h4>How has passenger transportation evolved in Mexico in recent years?</h4><p>Our business is very cyclical throughout the year. During the winter holidays, the summer vacation season, and then during spring break, we see peaks in our passenger segment. Our personnel segment is actually nearly counter cyclical to the passenger segment. The drivers for market performance have traditionally been Mexico's growing demographics and improving economic performance, both of which have been performing rather well over recent years—more so after the 2008-2009 crisis. As the economy improves, more people move around. You also have to consider that there is no real alternative to bus transportation in Mexico. There is no significant passenger rail system. There are only two railways for touristic purposes, one in Guadalajara and one in Chihuahua, while the rest are freight rail systems. As a result, it is only possible to move by car or by plane. However, only 3% of the population have access to air transport. So, when you look at the demographics, we service 97% of the population. Over 2012, we moved more than 20 million people per  year in the passenger segment and another 35 million people in the personal sector. That demographic has been increasing in size, so you would think that the bus industry would be growing; however, unfortunately it has not. That can be attributed to the perception of insecurity. Our company fortunately has not faced any incidents related to organized crime. People who travel by bus usually do not carry much. So, why would they be targeted by organized crime? There have been some unfortunate incidents in the industry with less organized bus companies, co-ops, or companies with fewer controls. We run a pretty tight ship and have strict controls in place. We know where our units are at all times, and mind travel times and passenger loads. We have strong security measures, including metal detectors at boarding stations and K9 units at border crossings.</p><div class="quote">“We have a significant market share on all the routes that we operate, which comes as a result of our good service."</div><h4>What strategies have you implemented to deal with cost challenges?</h4><p>We have had an increased focus on cost consciousness. Before we ran as four different bus companies, and now we run as one. We have pegged those businesses together and improved margins by roughly 3-4 percentage points. We have also been very successful in our “Route Rationalization Strategy." That means we have reduced empty kilometers, improved passenger load, and reduced the number of buses needed to service each route. Overall, we have managed to reduce our fleet size by some 200 units while servicing the same market. This translates into better performance and profitability. Our competitors, which are mainly co-ops, are not able to mimic this strategy and reduce kilometers or runs because of their multiple owners. Despite higher operating costs, mostly as a result of increasing diesel prices, we have had a better price environment. Within our cost structure, diesel is the most significant factor, aside from labor, and diesel costs have increased around 65%-70% over the last four years. Being able to transfer that is not easy. We have been increasing prices during the holiday seasons and every single year to recoup the industry's cost inflation. With good strategies, we have successfully been able to transfer this cost.</p><h4>How intense is the competition in the local market?</h4><p>It is fierce because bus transportation is slightly regionalized. We have a commanding market share in the northeast, but we have no presence in the south of Mexico. We have a significant market share on all the routes that we operate, which comes as a result of our good service. There are, however, three other large bus transportation companies that mostly follow the co-op model on a different scale, so their business models are very different from ours. Nevertheless, we do compete in several markets, though more so in the center of Mexico, where a large portion of the population resides. In several cities we even operate out of the same bus terminal, which makes competition even harder.</p><h4>How important is safety to the company?</h4><p>Mexico has built a great road system in the past several years, so there are not many accidents. There are more accidents in the south, where the roads are not as well maintained and bus companies are less professional. Accidents occur when buses are not in optimal condition. In our company, vehicle maintenance is something we take pride in. We are very strict and comply with both Mexican and US standards. We train drivers ourselves, at the Universidad del Autotransporte Senda, using a program that is certified in the US and by the Secretariat of Public Education in Mexico. It is also ISO 9000 certified. This system distinguishes us from our market peers; no other company has its own bus operator university.</p><h4>How does your fleet seek to stand out from the competition?</h4><p>Service, punctuality, and more service. Many of our competitors run buses with 48 seats, whereas we run buses with 42. In the US, instead of 44 seats, we have 36, providing extra legroom and thus a lot more comfort. We might not have a high frequency of service in certain parts of Mexico, but we have noticed that customers prefer our service and wait for our buses and drivers, especially for long trips like Monterrey to Chicago, a 36-hour route. We pride ourselves on our good service. Our drivers are not only very well prepared, but are always courteous and formally dressed. We take special attention to security and road safety, and measure punctuality, travel time, and diesel consumption. We also enforce speed limits very thoroughly.</p><h4>Should we expect an IPO anytime soon?</h4><p>When we decide to do an IPO, the listing will be primary—an IPO would be for growth. The company had been leveraged in the past; however, our shareholders are conservative. In order to keep growing, we need more capital, and we should get that fairly easily with an IPO. The company attempted to go public back in 2006, but markets went stale. We have been preparing for an IPO for quite some time, but we will only go public when the right projects align with the right timing. We are in no real hurry, although becoming a public company would materialize our already advanced institutionalization process. We are no longer a typical family-run business. We have strict corporate governance policies. We boast an outstanding board of directors, of which 50% of the members are truly independent and all very well renowned. We are audited by one of the big four audit companies and have migrated to IFRS accounting principles. We also have a new management team that has been entirely professionalized. We will be ready when the right time comes. The markets have been doing very well during 2H2012, so we will take advantage of the opportunities. We have been approached by basically every investment-banking firm to launch an IPO.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the benefit of Citi's large global presence?</h4><p>Considering its presence in more than 100 countries, we believe that Citi can provide connectivity to its clients around the world. When a client sees that Europe is cooling off and there are challenges, they might want to migrate to Africa, the Middle East, or China, and these destinations are only one phone call away through Citi. We have analyzed the world in terms of its trade corridors and we believe, for Turkey, the key trade corridors going forward are China, Africa, the Middle East, and Russia and the CIS. We have thus set up trade desks around the world for Turkish companies that would like to explore trade opportunities  with these countries. Another benefit for companies is Citi's electronic solutions, which allow clients to see their transactions and manage their money across the world at the push of a button.<br></p><h4>In this context, how can Citi work toward improving Turkey's current account deficit?</h4><p>The current account deficit is a challenge for the country. Trade and exports are one of the key cures, and we also want to build our strategy around adding value to the economy we operate in. Once the economy gets stronger, our clients will grow stronger and so will the competition. Investment banking is another area in which we truly believe we add value. We have millions of clients around the world and not only do M&amp;As, but also have the balance sheet and the know-how to do financing. Currently, we are receiving many phone calls from around the world regarding Turkey and the opportunities the country offers.</p><div class="quote">“Istanbul brings with it access to the Middle East, Europe, the CIS, and Africa."</div><h4>What is the significance of Turkey to Citi as a global bank?</h4><p>Turkey is a very important country for global companies, including Citi. As a result of its geographic strategic position, Turkey is a natural bridge between East and West. This is becoming even more important going forward. Being in Turkey grants access to 56 countries within a four-hour flight. It is the major trade and investment opportunity in the region. Turkey is a rising star due to its stable political environment, its economy, and especially its banking industry, which is very strong. Turkey excels in many metrics. Its consumer loans-to-GDP ratio is positive, as is its young population. This all point to a bright future. Turkey opens up many opportunities for Citi elsewhere in the world as it is becoming a hub for many multinationals, including finance companies. It is also positive that talent is staying in Turkey instead of heading abroad for work.</p><h4>What is the potential for Istanbul to become an international financial center?</h4><p>First of all, I believe that there is a tremendous potential and it is doable. Having said that, there are of course things that need to change to accelerate the process. Istanbul is not the only city in the world that has this ambition. Dubai is a contender, and so is Warsaw. However, Istanbul is very diverse and embraces other cultures. We have many international members of staff and have no qualms doing meetings in English. From the perspective of someone sitting in New York or London, Istanbul brings with it access to the Middle East, Europe, the CIS, and Africa. Turkey can interact with these cultures seamlessly. In terms of what needs to be done, I would highlight the tax regime. Having differentiated or specialized tax courts is one of the key items, and I believe the government is taking the necessary steps. The tax regime needs to be more diverse and automated. The labor law also needs to be looked at. The government is aware of the challenges and is determined  to accelerate the process of fixing these issues. Citi believes in the country and we want to work in any capacity we can to bring Turkey to its 2023 vision earlier.</p><h4>How would you characterize the medium-term outlook for the Turkish economy, and what does that mean for Citi's strategy for 2013 and beyond?</h4><p>That is the question we ask ourselves: how do we see Turkey in the future? And what can we do to help the country and add value? We see a very bright future for Turkey. There are many important, critical success factors here, but one important factor is getting politics rights and having a government that is able to take decisions. Our culture loves leaders. Turkey supports its leaders and it is important that the government makes sound decisions. Having a stable political framework is very important. Provided we have that, the future is very bright and lies with becoming a bridge between East and West and increasing trade along that corridor and across the whole region. Everything is falling together when you look at it from that perspective. Here is a country with strong political and economic infrastructure that is moving forward and is able to take that role and provide connectivity. That naturally gets me to Citi. It is interesting that the future of Turkey and the future of Citi and the ambitions of Turkey and Citi are very much aligned. The challenge for Turkey is its current account deficit. Citi is able to assist and cure it by attracting FDI. We have many plans in place for that. We are working with the top Fortune-500 companies around the world. That is why, again, that Turkey is stunningly important for Citi and we believe we are best positioned as a global institution to cater to its growth.</p><h4>What is your vision for Citi in Turkey?</h4><p>Our vision is to see our clients blossom from local into global companies. That is what we aspire to and it is one of the key strategic building blocks of Citi. Our aim is to grow companies and increase in strength along with our clients. From that perspective, we want to be a global bank in Turkey and the number one bank for trade.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As the Colombian economy is likely to grow steadily over the next few years, there will be increased demand for additional insurance coverage to safeguard that growth. How would you evaluate the culture and evolution of the local insurance sector?</h4><p>I think that the demand for insurance is very important in Colombia. There are two kinds of insurance that you can differentiate between: individual insurance and corporate insurance. Corporate insurance depends on the growth of the country; annual growth in the insurance sector can be up to two times the GDP growth rate. However, individual insurance can grow faster depending on the base of the insurance companies. For example, you need to have channels to appropriately reach the population. You cannot grow if you do not have a way to distribute your product. Insurance companies here are developing sales forces and new ways to reach people to offer individual insurance. I think the development of corporate insurance could go well with the growth of the economy. On the other hand, we have to develop our channels in an appropriate way to catch the surplus of individual savings.</p><h4>What are Seguros Bolí­var's plans for 2013?</h4><p>In our case, we know that savings are very important to increase our individual businesses. We are broadening our channels to reach clients in terms of sales force, internet usage, and call centers. We will also focus on being a financial group that has different types of products, such as bancassurance. We sell many insurance policies in Davivienda's offices, and there are about 700 offices all over the country. In those locations we sell life insurance and many other kinds of products, including automobile insurance. I see a very good future for the insurance industry with the environment that we have right now. It is getting better and better for the future because we are sure that Colombia is going to grow as the political model will not change. Change depends on how to spend the budget to help the poor and to eliminate poverty, but for us it is better. As poverty decreases, our customer base will increase in the future.</p><h4>Seguros Bolí­var is an example of success. What has been your growth strategy?</h4><p>We are conscious that we have to grow; however, we want to grow in a conscious manner. If you go too fast, you can hit a wall. You have to know where your potential is, what your strengths and weaknesses are, and then manage them to find the best approach. The first strategy that is very important for us is to have synergy with our companies. There are three companies that are associated with our insurance company: Davivienda, Leasing Bolivar, and our construction company. These sources are very important for our growth. The second thing that is very important for us is technology. Without technology we cannot grow because the transactions have to be very rapid. Client contact and our promise of value have to be accomplished. At the same time, knowledge of our business is very important. We have 3,000 agents and we are always recruiting more. These agents are our ways of communicating our policies, reaching our clients, and presenting our products. We think that differentiation is more important than price. The sales force is one of the main strategies for Seguros Bolí­var. We also make great efforts in educating our personnel. In Colombia, we do not have actuarial career education; therefore, we send people to the US to study. Our company has more actuaries than any other in Colombia. We think that the most important thing is not profits; the most important thing for us is humans.  At the same time, we have strengthened our relationships with some allied partners, international insurers such as AXA, Factory Mutual, and Zurich among others, to expand our business with multinational companies established in our country.</p><div class="quote">“We are conscious that we have to grow; however, we want to grow in a conscious manner."</div><h4>How has your product portfolio evolved over the past five years?</h4><p>The most important part of our portfolio is life insurance, which can be split into two branches: group life insurance and individual life insurance. Also, we have divided our market into low income and medium income. It is very difficult to catch the high-income sector. We are now trying to form a sales team with new kinds of presentations to offer to the high-income bracket. However, you have to have a very different kind of person. We have 1,000 people in the medium- and low-level income team. It is a specialized force offering mainly life insurance, but we are now offering home insurance as well. This is important for us and very profitable. We have almost 2,000 people selling four kinds of insurance: life insurance, health insurance, automobile insurance, and a periodical saving called capitalization. With these four products we can more or less meet all the needs to insure a family or an individual. We have a relationship with Davivienda that is very important in group insurance, the insurance that covers debt or a person with a mortgage. For life insurance, in the case of a debtor's death, we pay the debt off at that moment. Another is fire insurance for property. These two kinds of insurance are very important for us. In Colombia, social security is divided into three branches: pensions, health insurance, and worker's compensation. When you make a contribution to a pension fund, part of it is for your savings and the second part is for disability and death. If you are disabled, before your retirement you receive your pension, or if you die your widow receives your pension instead. Insurance companies sell these kinds of insurance to the pension funds. There are 10 million people that are in the pension fund that are eligible soon. There will be a huge mass of people that are going to retire, and we have to profit from that.</p><h4>How are your operations in the region evolving, and are you looking at new markets?</h4><p>In Venezuela, the savings rate is very low. Seguros Bolí­var is a life insurance company and it is very difficult to find a specialized sales force. Labor conditions in Venezuela are very difficult right now. Ecuador is showing some very good economic results and the standard of living is increasing. In the 12 or 13 years that we have been there, we have been growing well. There is a good environment and they are very good workers. In Ecuador, as in Colombia, people like to work and they like to make a lot of effort. I think there is a market for life insurance there. We are also in Panama, Costa Rica, Honduras, and Salvador, forming a network for serving and penetrating the increasingly important market of Central America.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main activities that Bacomext undertakes to improve Mexico's economic competitiveness?</h4><p>I am in charge of two development banks in Mexico: Nacional Financiera and Banco Nacional de Comercio Exterior (Bancomext), which have different mandates. Nacional Financiera has the mandate to provide access to credit for SMEs and also to participate in the risk capital industry to make it possible for entrepreneurs to access risk capital. We also have an investment banking side of the institution that provides financing for sustainable development projects, particularly alternative energy projects like wind, solar, and geothermal projects. Bancomext provides financing for industries that are particularly geared toward exports to generate foreign exchange. We finance all kinds of projects, including the expansion of capacity, trade finance, and the export of Mexican goods and services to the rest of the world. We also provide financing to the tourism sector, which provides services for foreigners who come to Mexico and generate a lot of foreign exchange. The two banks have different mandates and they operate separately, although they have the same top management. In the past six years of this government, we have been able to increase the resources Nacional Financiera provides to SMEs very substantially. We have grown financing to SMEs by four fold in Mexico and we have supported hundreds of thousands of SMEs with credit. We have an important program that provides guarantees to financial intermediaries to mitigate the risk of lending to small businesses. SMEs have a higher risk than consolidated larger businesses, so by providing guarantees we mitigate the risk so they can more readily lend to SMEs with better terms and conditions. This program has been multiplied by seven times in the last six years. It has become a very important part of lending to SMEs. About 55% of the total resources given by the commercial banks to SMEs is guaranteed by Nacional Financiera. We are sharing the risk and providing a safety net so that the banks and financial intermediaries can lend a lot more money to the sector. At Bancomext, we have provided financing for many important projects. For example, in the financial crisis of 2008-2009, when the commercial banks were very risk adverse, we provided a lot of financing to many medium and large corporations that had difficulty in accessing the capital markets or the banking sector. That way they could continue expanding their activities and they did not suffer the slowdown and retraction of credit that occurred in 2009. We also provided significant financing to the automotive industry in Mexico, which is already a very important sector. We are the fourth largest exporter of automobiles in the world. During 2009, both Chrysler and General Motors went bankrupt in the US. They did not have access to financing, so we provided many lines and guarantees for the suppliers of those corporations so they could continue exporting, and we also financed two very large plants in Mexico.</p><h4>What sort of trends have you witnessed from SMEs looking to export their goods or services abroad, and where do you see the greatest opportunities in Mexico?</h4><p>The automotive industry is a very important one, but we also have a lot of companies participating in the electronics industry, which is very large in Mexico, and also in the providing of services for maquiladoras, the inbound industries that exist on the US border for export. In the tourism sector there is a lot of potential and we have financed the construction of about 5,000 rooms in the hotel business. The aeronautical industry is also becoming an important one in Mexico. We already have several assemblers of fuselage parts for airplanes. In the future, Mexico is going to become a large manufacturing center for North America and the rest of the world. Little by little, Mexico is becoming a major exporter. We already export $1 billion per day, and that is more than all of Latin America combined. There are a lot of companies moving their manufacturing centers or factories from the US, Canada, Europe, and also from China. The logistics and transportation costs are becoming more difficult to handle from far away, so many companies in the US and Canada prefer to have their resources and supply management closer to home, so Mexico is a particularly attractive platform. Also, the energy availability in Mexico is ample. We are a very large producer and exporter of oil, and the availability of shale gas in North America is beginning to change the energy equation to make Mexico a much more competitive manufacturing center. The future of Mexico is very bright. We need to improve infrastructure and the rule of law and many other things, but it has the potential to grow much more rapidly in the coming years. The financial situation is particularly good compared to other countries around the world in terms of debt-to-GDP, the deficit reserves, inflation, growth, demographics, and so on.</p><div class="quote">“Basel III is going to have an impact on financing and on the availability of financing, particularly long-term financing and costs."</div><h4>How do you foresee the new banking relations such as Basel III impacting the wider banking industry in emerging markets such as Mexico?</h4><p>Basel III is going to have an impact on financing and on the availability of financing, particularly long-term financing and costs, given the requirements of additional capital and liquidity. Although the Mexican financial system is a very strong one and it is very well capitalized, I think it will have more of an impact on European banks and some US banks. It will probably affect the project financing of long-term infrastructure projects because they require large amounts of financing over very long tenures, and that is penalized by Basel III requirements. The regulatory authorities of the world are going to have to be careful in implementing and monitoring the unintended consequences of the regulation. We are already seeing some European banks, for example, moving back from long-term projects when they were very eager to participate, and they are not so eager now because of the impact it will have on the capital of the bank and the liquidity gap of long-term financing versus short-term funding. There is a question whether trade financing is going to be affected by Basel III, and there is contradictory evidence. The regulators say that it will have no impact, while the industry says it will have a large impact. There is no consensus on what's going to be the true impact of the trade financing regulation, which is much safer and more short term. The banks are going to try to maximize their return on equity and minimize the impact of capital requirements.</p><h4>What steps do you think should be taken to increase the amount of credit available in Mexico and incorporate more people into the country's banking system?</h4><p>Mexico has very low financial penetration, which is measured by total banking debt versus GDP. There is enormous potential to grow financing to families and to businesses. The large corporations have total access to the financial market not only in Mexico, but also around the world. These are large corporations that have lots of resources and can access the international capital markets. However, as you go down in the pyramid, the small and very small businesses have a lot of difficulty in accessing credit, and that is why the development banks are working hard to provide guarantees and support for the base of the pyramid. There is still a lot to be done.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance of Turkey for Lufthansa as a global airline group?</h4><p>Germany and Turkey have a long and solid relationship. It started in the 1950s with flights to Istanbul, which was the first Turkish destination for Lufthansa. That continued with flights to Ankara and Izmir, and now we also have flights to Antalya in summer as well. Turkey is currently the only country in Europe that has large GDP growth, and the airline business is growing as well. Lufthansa Group is a proud part of that. The country is very important for the Lufthansa Group—not just Lufthansa—because we also partnered with Swiss and Austrian airlines. We would like to increase our flights, frequencies, and even passenger figures in the coming years. In Turkey, we have many ongoing projects with the German and Turkish governments. The German foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle, was recently in Istanbul to observe its strong connection with Germany.</p><h4>How do Lufthansa's operations in Turkey fit into the global Lufthansa strategy?</h4><p>Lufthansa Group, including Swiss International and Austrian Airlines, provide excellent connections via home hubs in Frankfurt, Munich, Vienna, and Zurich. Our goal for the upcoming years is clear; we would like to increase our share in the Turkish market. The company's strategy is to continue to be Europe's number one airline with our premium services. Lufthansa has long-lasting experience of providing exclusive premium services, giving its customers the freedom of ultimate relaxation and peace of mind whether on board or on the ground. Worldwide, 60 state-of-the-art lounges with a total space of 38,000 sqminvite customers to relax and escape the busy atmosphere at airports. Furthermore, a vast number of on-board service initiatives featuring carefully selected wines and dishes created by top chefs, the widest first-class bed in the industry, as well as a state-of-the-art fully flat business class seats make Lufthansa one of the leading premium airlines. In 2012, we almost reached the 1 million passenger mark in Turkey. We launched summer flights from Istanbul to Berlin, which are not open in the winter yet, but we are hoping to open those in 2013 as well. We are also considering flights from Ankara to Berlin, but those have not been confirmed.</p><div class="quote">“Germany and Turkey have a long and solid relationship."</div><h4>What has been driving the growth in Turkish passenger numbers for Lufthansa?</h4><p>It is the growing business connections between Turkey and Germany, and also Turks living in Germany coming back to visit their country. Additionally, we focus on passengers on the way to North Atlantic with our seamless transfer at Frankfurt, Munich, Vienna, and Zurich.</p><h4>How would you characterize the advantages and disadvantages of Istanbul as an air-travel hub?</h4><p>Istanbul's biggest advantage is its geographical location. It is quite close to the Far East, but it is not too far from North America. However, infrastructure in Istanbul is a problem. The traffic to the airports is really challenging. You might get stuck in a traffic jam that lasts half the length of the flight time to Frankfurt. This is a disadvantage for local travellers as well for cargo. Atatürk International Airport is quite an overcrowded airport, from the travel side as well as on the runway. Sabiha Gökçen is a more modern airport, but it is far away from the city center. There are two international airports in the city, but we just need one airport with modern facilities, strong infrastructure, and room for growth.</p><h4>How could Istanbul improve its competitiveness as an air-travel hub?</h4><p>With a new airport, Istanbul would be more competitive. Starting with a clean slate and working up, it could be made more convenient for passengers. There could be a fast lane for high-value customers as well for customers who need support, enough space for lounges, and more gate positions so it isn't necessary for a bus to carry passengers to the terminal. Also, improving the roads to the airport and reducing traffic jams would be advantageous, as well as maybe even building a new metro line exclusively for the airport. Istanbul is currently planning to build a new airport close to the Black Sea.</p><h4>Visas are a huge point of contention amongst travelers between Turkey and Germany. What is your view on this situation?</h4><p>I was recently invited to a conference in Berlin to talk about this issue. It is a problem not just for the Turkish passengers to Germany, but also if you transfer via Germany. If I send my employees to Germany for training, visas become a time problem. The German government has introduced a new, easier system, hoping it will solve this problem. The visa topic is on my priority list to reduce the hurdles for our Turkish customers.</p><h4>How does Lufthansa stay competitive in Turkey?</h4><p>I quickly learned that Turkish people love to eat. Lufthansa is changing its food and beverage menu to include more local food as of January 1, 2013 in business class. We will do this for three months, then switch back and review feedback and make a decision from there. We are trying to make the food less Western and more Turkish, so we decided to work with a well-known Turkish chef. We always have a very famous chef working on our European and international flights. Lufthansa is always looking for other famous chefs, and it will be no different on our Turkey flights. The food and beverage menu is probably one of the most important things to change. It is very important that you have good, quality food to enjoy on your flight because the passengers remember it. Additionally, we are trying to get a fast lane for our business class passengers at Atatürk International Airport. Our target is to make the travel experience as comfortable as possible, from the first step into the airport. Lufthansa is already offering internet and mobile check-in, which reduces the waiting time at the check-in counter.</p><h4>What trends do you expect to see in Turkey's air-travel market over the next five to 10 years?</h4><p>One trend we are seeing at the moment is the internet. Turkey is a market with many internet users, but people still go to travel agencies to book flights. I think this will change in the future, and business will become more online based. We already have a website and we are working on offering a payment via installments, which we are currently working with the banks to achieve. However, travel agents are very important to us—most of our business is generated by them. If we offer something on our website, we have to acknowledge travel agencies as well. Turks are more hesitant about using online banking and e-commerce. It is very important to seize opportunities when they arise.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the company grown since it was founded in 2003?</h4><p>It has grown from 200,000 passengers to 5 million in just under 10 years. Naturally, with that, the number of aircraft and routes has grown too, as has the number of employees. Revenue has grown and profits have increased. It has been a total growth story.</p><h4>What are the advantages of being publicly owned?</h4><p>When you are publicly listed you are accountable, and are much more disciplined as a result. The benefit of going public is that it helps you to raise funds to expand the business. Once you raise the funds, though, there is quite a lot of responsibility to provide a return to those who invested in the business. From Air Arabia's perspective, the IPO has been very good in terms of returns.</p><div class="quote">“I think the UAE has become a true transport hub purely as a result of its open-door policy."</div><h4>What challenges exist in being a low-cost carrier?</h4><p>The airline industry is always going to be a challenge, and challenge brings opportunity. Challenges include things that are outside of our control, such as the cost of fuel and the weather. Other challenges exist when countries do not allow more inbound routes in order to protect their national carriers.</p><h4>How does the UAE compare to countries like Egypt or Morocco as a transport hub?</h4><p>I think the UAE has become a true transport hub purely as a result of its open-door policy. It also encourages competition. Therefore, any airline can come to the UAE. This has probably made the work for some UAE airlines a bit more difficult, but it has benefited the country, the people, the airport, and even the airlines in the long term. Morocco's approach with Europe has been to sign an open-skies treaty, and that has been fantastic. It has grown the market tremendously. Egypt, on the other hand, does not allow low-cost airlines to operate in Cairo. As a result, in our opinion, the airport is underutilized.</p><h4>You have won numerous CEO of the Year awards. Why do you keep getting these accolades and what makes your approach different?</h4><p>Being the head of a team I tend to get the recognition, but the work is done by all the people around me. We have a fantastic group of people at the company, a lot of whom started the business with me—and we still enjoy it together. My simplicity and approach gives comfort to the people who work in the company, and they use their initiative to move the business forward.</p><h4>Air Arabia is now flying to Basra. Are there any other regions that you have short-term plans to expand into?</h4><p>We started flights in the middle of 2012 to Erbil and then into Basra, and we are hoping to soon be in Baghdad. In Pakistan of late we have increased our operations from seven flights to 21 flights a week. In 2012, we expanded into Russia, Ukraine, and Central Asia. I think we will continue progress on that front over 2013. We will also expand a bit more in Pakistan in 2013. We also hope to have further frequency and some expansion into Turkey, again a very developing market. We wish to expand more into India, but that is subject to a bilateral agreement between the two countries. Saudi Arabia has been great and continues to expand and has done very well. We would like to expand a bit more in Qatar, subject to the Qatari authorities granting us permission.</p><h4>Air Arabia's plans to expand into Jordan stalled in 2011. Will there be any progress in that country this year?</h4><p>We had penciled in Jordan as a hub. Circumstances have changed. The economy hit the wall and then we had the Arab Spring, which moved into summer, winter, and beyond. The climate was really not ready for setting up a hub.</p><h4>Investors are flocking to the country and shareholders are very happy. Air Arabia's Q3 profits were up around 126% in 2012. How do you manage that demand to prevent it from being becoming overwhelming?</h4><p>Everyone has to be realistic in life. I think this is one of the challenges with being publicly listed because you have to tell people what are you doing and how much are you making. In a private business you do not have to report those things. You can just bank it. It is great as a company to have been able to announce positive results since we started this business 10 years back. Every single year we have seen profits, though some years are better than others. In 2012 we are still waiting to announce the final result, but Q3 three was a fantastic quarter for us. This was achieved through a combination of reasons. We had a much higher seat factor, our yield per passenger was better, our fuel hedging hit at the right time, and we increased our ancillary revenue by almost 60% by introducing many new ancillary opportunities. We have to strive to improve the business—that is our job and the trust that our shareholders have put in us. We are all committed to that. However, one needs to put a cap on this. This business has its ups and downs. So far it has been up and we want to keep it up. However, we have to be realistic and acknowledge that it is not always going to be going up. So long as we are profitable, we will remain competitive.</p><h4>What is your forecast for the airline industry in the UAE going into this year?</h4><p>Fuel is a big factor. Fuel volatility is now part of any transport life, which by now we should have all gotten used to. We should expect sudden changes in fuel prices up or down. We have to be flexible enough to manage that. The Arab Spring has had, so far, a surprisingly positive impact because people continue to travel. I think that could be because the Middle East has never been a boring place. Therefore, maybe we are immune to the problem. It is unfortunate that there are some areas we cannot fly to, like Syria, for example. Syria is a very good market that we are not operating in. Egypt saw, last year, a drop due to the election and political developments. In the last few months we have seen positive improvements in Egypt and I think more stability will come to that area, which will be good. It is very difficult to predict. We are, as an airline, pretty happy that it has been a fantastic decade of growth.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Norway is very pleased with the close relationship that has developed between our countries in the energy sphere and the increasingly close cooperation between Statoil and SOCAR. The Norwegian supply industry has also made substantial deliveries to projects in the Caspian Sea area. The Caspian region plays an increasingly important role in the world energy market. Azerbaijan has long proved itself to be a reliable and important partner as a producer of oil and gas. Our two countries share the ambition of being reliable suppliers of energy to Europe. Azerbaijan has a key role to play as the enabler of the southern gas corridor, which will link the Caspian region even closer to Europe. Norway fully supports a southern gas corridor, which will further enhance Europe's security of supply. The corridor is important to many European countries.</p><p>Azerbaijan's oil history dates back as far as the 1840s. Norway's experience goes back to the late 1960s. Statoil was among the first international oil companies to invest in Azerbaijan when independence was re-established and international oil companies were invited in. Both Azerbaijan and Norway face the challenge of making sure that our energy resources are managed in a sustainable manner. We must ensure that the resources will also benefit our children and grandchildren, thus taking a long-term perspective in resource management.</p><div class="quote">“Both Azerbaijan and Norway face the challenge of making sure that our energy resources are managed in a sustainable manner."</div><p>Let me share a reflection based on Norway's own experience. When a substantial part of the national income is generated by oil and gas exports, it is particularly important that we have clear and transparent rules and practices governing both the extraction of resources and the handling of the revenues generated. Too many countries have experienced the so-called “resource curse" where short-lived money flows have led to massive social disparities, inflated spending, and a lack of control of a vital national reserve. Hence, our joint focus on the need for long-term strategies, environmental responsibility, and transparency is crucial. Azerbaijan's focus on the environment and the establishment of a national oil fund is commendable. Norway also hopes to see a continued dialogue on other topics for the mutual benefit of our two nations, such as regional stability, security, human rights, and democracy.</p><p>I am pleased about Norway's cooperation with Azerbaijan in the framework of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), where countries and companies work together to promote transparency, accountability, and good governance. We commend Azerbaijan for embracing this initiative at a very early stage and for setting an important example.</p><p>It is also worth mentioning the growing importance of being attached to corporate social responsibility. Governments, commercial entities, and civil societies all have important roles to play in creating a solid basis for sustainable development for the benefit of the entire society. Azerbaijan's role in the global energy market is already important, and its role is set to become even more significant in the future. I hope to see the mutually beneficial partnership between Azerbaijan and Norway to develop in the years to come both in the energy sphere and in other areas.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You were appointed at the beginning of 2012 as part of the government's plans to redouble efforts to promote tourism. What has been your incoming strategy?</h4><p>I have worked in tourism for many years, so when I arrived here in March I knew what we had to do. First of all, we had to pursue a national promotional campaign, and after that begin with a program of public relations in the US. Those were our two main activities. Our national campaign was the most important in the entire history of the Ministry of Tourism in Mexico City, costing approximately $10 million. Our strategy of public relations in the US alone cost around $2 million. For us, that is a lot of money. In the same way, we work with the International Tourism Fair of the Americas (FITA), and we have had great successes. Those three actions were the most important components of our strategy. There are many things that we do in the Ministry of Tourism, such as promotion carnivals. We went to 25 of the biggest cities in the country, and we did the same in South and Central America, where we received around 2,000 journalists or media personnel from around the world.</p><h4>Almost one-quarter of residents in Mexico City directly or indirectly earn income from tourism into the city. What are the key strengths of the capital as a tourism hub?</h4><p>Over 2012, Mexico City will receive 12.5 million tourists. We have nearly 50,000 hotels rooms in Mexico City, and we will finish the year with about a 65% occupation rate, which is excellent since the traditional rate is 54%. We have an income from tourism of around $4 billion, which is the most important income we receive. With the economic crisis, Mexico City lost 1 million foreign tourists in two years; however, now we have recuperated by 50%. There is a lot of income lost because of that 50% we haven't reclaimed. Mexico City employs nearly 300,000 people directly and 600,000 people indirectly in the tourism sector, producing about 80% of the GNP. Of those 12.5 million people arriving in hotels, 2.5 million are from different countries and 10 million are national tourists.</p><div class="quote">“Mexico City is a large tourist destination with four UNESCO sites, which makes us unique."</div><h4>Mexican tourists spend billions in US dollars yearly visiting the US. What can be done to redirect tourism back into Mexico from the US?</h4><p>We are working with the Mexican Tourism Board in Los Angeles, Miami, Houston, Dallas, and Chicago. We try to work together to have more resources and work in large and segmented campaigns in public relations. For the past few years, Mexico City has been sending the wrong message, which was “come to Mexico City because you can do anything you want here." However, the people who came here couldn't do that because they didn't have enough time, money, or information. We are working specifically in different kinds of sectors to help boost tourism; for example, conferences, conventions, leisure, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT), and medical sectors. We have to build in the US four different campaigns for these different targets. Mexico City is a large tourist destination with four UNESCO sites, which makes us unique. In our historic downtown, we have 1,400 colonial buildings and 176 museums according to the International Counsel of Museums, putting us just behind London and on the same level as Beijing. The Frieda Kahlo Museum is one of the most visited in the country. We have excellent infrastructure for culture and a very specialized side for conferences and conventions. Five years ago, we were 62nd in world destinations for conventions, and now we are 39th. There has been huge progress over these five years, and we think we will obtain an even higher position by the end of 2012. The LGBT sector is also very important for us; Mexico City recognizes same-sex marriages and adoptions. Because of that, we have increased LGBT tourism and we are building public policy around this kind of tourism. We are happy and proud of this. Mexico City is the second destination in the country for LGBT tourists. We are working on the medical tourism sector as well, especially from the US. Every year 1.6 million US citizens travel abroad to receive medical treatment. They go to India, Malaysia, Turkey, and Brazil; however, not Mexico City. Here, we have some of the most important private services. Mexico City could be the best in the world on price for at least 50 different operations of medium and high specialty. We are building a large platform of medical tourism around this information. We will create a call center in the US to allow people to have all the information they need in English and to share their files through four main private hospitals. Those files will be studied by the hospitals so they can quote a price, meaning the patients can make a decision in the US and pay there as well; then, they can come here to receive their treatment. It will be finished by early 2013. We in Mexico City have one of the most modern projects in medical tourism related to the US market. Those are the important things for us.</p><h4>Would you say there remains an erroneous perception of the security situation in the capital that adversely affects tourism?</h4><p>Those images are a very difficult thing to erase. One of the best examples is the pollution. We used to be in the top-three most polluted cities in the world, but now we are very far from the top, yet the perception still remains. In terms of security, it is the same. Mexico City used to be one of the most dangerous cities in the world with one of the worst perceptions, but the situation has changed dramatically. Over the last six years, Mexico City's government has instigated very important security campaigns, with now more than 70,000 police officers on the city's streets and a system of 1,500 surveillance cameras. Mexico City is now considered one of the safest cities in the country and in Latin America. Our new system of surveillance and increased amount of police officers had a huge impact on tourism. People coming here from abroad quickly changed their perception about the safety of Mexico City. The challenge is to change this perception in the US and the EU. Latin Americans already know this so they come here more and more, but we have lost the participation of tourists coming from the US because of that image. We have to erase this image and put a lot of money into campaigns to do that.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2013?</h4><p>The new administration has to work in a structural way. The tourism in Mexico City is concentrated in the downtown area and the Chapultepec area, around the shrine of Guadalupe. We have to improve different areas. This is why we have launched a major program for learning, training, and certifying people from different parts of the city to become the best producers of tourism services, and we are trying to reach an equal level of quality over the entire city. That is one of the challenges for the next administration. The other challenge is to bring more and more shows to Mexico City, because in the last few years we have a new capacity of venues for that segment of the market. Also, it is important that we pursue public relations and advertising campaigns in the US. Things are clear in Mexico City and the new Mayor wants to develop tourism on a smaller scale, for example in neighborhoods. It will produce tourism in the city, the country, and at the international level.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the prospects for the $200 million investment in the industrial conversion of your plant in Bogotá?</h4><p>The idea came as a desire to reinvent the production model. We felt the need to do so because the country's economic model is changing. We used to have a model in which everything had to be produced in the country so it can be sold. That began 56 years ago. In 1990, the president at the time opened up the economy and producers were then able to import goods to sell in Colombia. However, that was with a duty tax of, in our case, 35%. As a result, we changed some things around and began importing. We import 40% of the cars we sell and produce around 60%. Juan Manuel Santos, when he was the Minister of Economy 10 years ago, signed the agreement to completely open up the economy with 0% duty on goods from Mexico. This had been preceded by the creation of the Andean Community, which created a common market like the EU. Colombia also signed a free trade agreement (FTA) with the US, and potential negotiations with South Korea have been discussed in congress. An FTA with the EU has already passed through the European Parliament and it will pass here soon. When the model changes, we need to as well. We assemble five platforms of cars and we also assemble trucks. We have to create a model that is not only efficient, but can produce various products. It is a bit more costly than having one line producing one car. When you have to compete with the entire world, then you have to be more efficient. As a result, the model has to change.</p><h4>What is your current focus in terms of models?</h4><p>At the moment we are focusing on the Chevrolet Sail and the Cobalt in Colombia. The $200 million investment is destined to improve the factory and develop new areas of opportunity while reducing costs and boosting efficiency. Part of the investment will be in the stamping plant. Stamping is important because it is one aspect of production that is impacted by logistics. When you import body parts they must not be scratched or damaged. They are, therefore, very expensive to transport. We need to develop volume. You cannot change the molds every hour to begin stamping a new part, and must be able to produce at higher volumes in order to reduce costs and boost competitiveness. Investment will be targeted at installing robots in certain areas that will boost efficiency and ergonomics at the plant.</p><div class="quote">“We currently produce 60,000 cars. We would like to boost this to 100,000."</div><h4>In which segments is GM strongest?</h4><p>We try to produce cars in the biggest segments. The largest segment in the country is the mini car segment. Looking at that area, we have a 55% market share with the Spark and the Spark GT. They are both produced here. In the small car segment we have gained a 40% market share through the Sail and Sonic models. We import the Sonic from Mexico. We believe that we can reach a 50% market share. However, the Sail is bigger in its segment with nearly a 30% share. That will not change much. If we become more competitive on the manufacturing side that does not mean that we will jump from 30% to 70%. We currently produce 60,000 cars. We would like to boost this to 100,000. Without other models, sales will not increase, but excess production can be exported. That is the key challenge.</p><h4>What markets are you looking at?</h4><p>We have to succeed in markets that are similar to ours. Central America is very important for us. The government is in talks regarding the Pacific Basin. This is also an interesting market for us. We can most likely export to Argentina, or other nations in the region. That is going to be in the next five years.</p><h4>What is Colombia's potential to become an export hub in the region?</h4><p>Everything is in place for that to be a reality. We have to push hard for it, but it will happen. Colombia is in a special location. It has two oceans and that gives businesses access to both the Pacific and Atlantic. It is also located on the equator and that means we're close to the US, Mexico, and Central America. We can also head south to Chile, Argentina, Brazil, and Peru. Human talent here is excellent—Colombians are hard working and well organized. The economy and the country's politics have been stable for almost a century, and the level security is up there with the highest in the region. Based on the democratic security of the President, we are finally in a position to put an end to violence. The world is finally seeing the real Colombia. It is seeing the opportunities that it has on offer as the second highest populated country in South America.</p><h4>What trends can you identify in the Colombian demand for automobiles?</h4><p>Around 300,000 units are sold every year. This equates to around seven cars for every 1,000 people, and puts us only slightly ahead of Bolivia and Paraguay. Brazil, Argentina, and Chile sell around 22 cars per 1,000 people, which is three times what we sell in terms of population. Ecuador sells 10 per 1,000 people, higher than what we do. That is why there is huge potential in this market and we are beginning to see it bear fruit.</p><h4>What factors are contributing to the increasing demand for automobiles?</h4><p>Statistics show that the middle class is growing quickly. A growing middle class means more money and more wealth. This creates a huge potential to sell cars. Everybody wants to have a car. The car today is like the TV was 30 years ago. Everybody wanted to have a TV. Now, everybody has a TV and a cell phone. The car is synonymous with wealth and gives you the ability to go anywhere you want. That is very important for the people. The government's focus on investing in infrastructure will also impact the industry in that respect. For example, the completion of the La Lí­nea highway tunnel will reduce travel times on one of Colombia's main east-west road connections by up to 30%. In terms of the location of our new plant, it has to be close to a major population center and we chose Bogotá. As Bogotá is in the middle of the country, you have to pass through three mountain chains to efficiently export. The parts are imported, built, and the car is then sent back along the same route. This costs a lot and, as a result, developing infrastructure is not only important for the people, but also for the efficient production of cars.</p><h4>At a recent automobile fair, you launched two models: Orlando and Tracker. They have had a very good reception in Colombia. What is your most popular model?</h4><p>In the last one-and-a-half years we have almost re-launched the entire portfolio. In 2011, in the truck segment, we changed our entire portfolio with the launch of the 700 Series. One year ago, we also launched the N300, which is a cargo minivan. In August 2012 we launched the Sail, and in September we launched the Sonic. After that, in October, we launched the Cobalt. In the last three months GM has launched seven products. At the recent Bogotá Autoshow, we had 248,000 visits in just 12 days, where we launch Orlando and Tracker. This is an increase of 16% over 2010 and that was a big month in terms of sales. Most of them are leaders in their segments. The car we sell the most is the Sail.</p><h4>Where do you mainly import parts from?</h4><p>This depends on the type of vehicle. We mainly import from South Korea, Mexico, Brazil, and China.</p><h4>What role are small cities playing in your overall strategy?</h4><p>The changes that we're seeing in the middle class are also being reflected in small cities. Bogotá is Bogotá and has its own challenges. The medium-sized cities in Colombia are well developed and, as a result, I do not expect to see a lot of growth in those areas. Places such as Cartagena and Barraquilla will benefit hugely from the FTAs. Smaller cities like Armenia, Popayán, Yopal, and Barrancabermeja are also growing a lot. Five years ago, nobody had a dealership in those cities. Today, we have complete dealers, not just promotion points. People are buying more cars as they have extra disposable income. Automobiles are tools that will develop the economy, especially trucks and pick ups. This is an area the country is growing well in.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[aggressive-for-growth]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How can Mozambique's financial sector diversify to meet the needs of the future?</h4><p>Mozambique's economy and financial system will grow in the coming decade, and finance institutions will need to be able to provide adequate products and services to a growing economy. Moza Banco's core advantage is that it understands the market because of the exposure and business relationships of its local stakeholders in all quadrants of the economy. Mozambique also assembles rather solid and effective regulation across key areas of the financial sector. Last year, the authorities revised the Foreign Exchange Law, while this year a publication was effected on a new law and regulation outlining criteria for the concession and observance of projects related to public-private partnerships, megaprojects, and corporate concessions. However, the financial market would welcome favorable regulatory terms for the efficient operation of Maputo Stock Exchange (BVM). For example, it came to our attention that just recently the Ministerial Cabinet approved a revision of the Tax Code over legal entities (IRPC), which amongst other changes will effectively double the level of withholding tax to 20% for income received from investments in listed debt securities. The financial market would also be pleased with a regulatory framework in aspects of wealth and asset management, sharia-compliant finance, and derivative products, which haven't received much attention.</p><h4>The Bank of Mozambique has followed a policy to reduce interest rates, the most recent fall being from 11.5% to 9.5%, yet commercial banks still charge upward of 20% to customers. When will credit become more affordable in Mozambique?</h4><p>Moza Banco is predominantly a corporate and business bank and, as such, is exposed to the aggressive reductions of the standing loan facility (FPC) that have occurred this year. As per our last asset and liabilities committee (ALCO), around 40% of our portfolios are indexed to the FPC. So, naturally, credit has become more affordable for our clients. However, it is important to emphasize that the bank does not obtain its funding from the Bank of Mozambique, whilst only a handful of institutional clients are cash flush and rather influential in determining the price level for deposits. Also, other variables need to be factored in to determine the price of credit, as, for example, the lengthy and costly process of recovering non-performing loans (NPLs) via the judicial system. A study done a few years ago by the World Bank demonstrated that per $1 of capital provided, the financial system only recovers $0.11 when it is forced to draw on the collateral.</p><div class="quote">“In addition to Chinese and Brazilian investors, we have seen a lot of US investors in 2012."</div><h4>How would you evaluate the Bank of Mozambique's policy to further depreciate the metical (MZN)?</h4><p>We have to be extremely careful in terms of the effect of high-profile investments and the natural resources that have recently been discovered, such as gas, coal, and maybe oil in the near future. If our currency becomes too strong, it will become non-competitive for the traditional export products such as sugar, tobacco, cotton, and wood. It could eliminate the agricultural sector, for example, and we may hurt the tourism sector as well. I am a bit skeptical on how this will evolve, but I am positive that the Bank of Mozambique and the IMF will regulate together in order to make sure the traditional sectors are not neglected. This is very important, as more jobs are created via the more traditional sectors.</p><h4>Are you expecting the metical to continue to depreciate?</h4><p>I expect there will be some depreciation until the end of the year, but it will not be volatile. The depreciation of the metical will be controllable and I think it will reach a maximum of MZN30/31 to the US dollar. Over the one- or two-year horizon, the metical is expected to trade broadly stronger amidst the inflow of capital for the realization of mega-projects in the resource sector and related businesses. There are also large investments in agribusiness, such as the production of glucose for paper manufacturing, sugar, and rice, as well as related manufacturing plants in the pipeline. Nevertheless, it really depends on the scale of investments that will be realized, the adequacy of the road, rail, and port infrastructure that are needed to make such investments feasible, and how the trade balance of the country will be managed.</p><h4>Moçambique Capitais holds the largest stake in Moza Banco. To what extent is private equity developing Mozambique's financial environment?</h4><p>It is still in the initial phases, but due to the dependence of corporations on leveraging the business, I foresee immense opportunities in this field. There are one or two deals that I have seen; however, I believe that there will be many more to come in the next five to 10 years. We need to diversify the traditional ways of obtaining finance in Mozambique.</p><h4>In terms of international clients that are coming to Mozambique, what trends are you noticing in origin and areas of interest?</h4><p>In addition to Chinese and Brazilian investors, we have seen a lot of US investors in 2012. We believe there are going to be substantial US investments coming online as well as German investments. I also believe that Middle Eastern investors are starting to look at Mozambique, and they have some delegations that are coming here and will have meetings with senior local representatives. US investor interest is generally oil and gas related, but they also come here to look at the agricultural sector as well. I think that, along with upstream oil and gas operations, there will be a trickle-down effect on the agricultural industry as well. In relation to agriculture, we should note that only 10% of farmable land is used for agriculture, which shows enormous growth potential for a sector that imports most of its basic products, such as cereals maize, rice, wheat, tomatoes, and potatoes.</p><h4>How has Moza Banco positioned itself to serve these sectors?</h4><p>We have many specialists and we have been able to create many niche markets. We want to develop this and create a different segmentation process. We are the only bank that has created a trade finance platform able to access both local and international clients. Mozambique is a country that produces little locally, and trade finance specialists and managers are something that will be needed. We have created a very strong corporate team and an international desk group. In 2012, our shareholder capital increased from $35 million to $45 million to be able to leverage these projects.</p><h4>How has the increase in share capital impacted your position in the market?</h4><p>I do not like to speak about numbers because we are a fairly new bank, having been around for only four-and-a-half years. However, Moza Banco has steadily improved its position in terms of deposits and in terms of credit. We are the largest of the small banks in terms of assets, currently ranked fifth in this category, though we still want to grow. We have an extremely aggressive expansion plan according to which we will have 23 branches by end-2012 and 30 branches by end-2013. It is an extremely aggressive expansion plan, but our main focus is on human resources, as that is the main capital of any bank. We conduct a very important training program before we open any branch. The bank's main focus is definitely on human resources. We have launched a training school and the staff are monitored at the end of every training day. It is definitely a program that has a huge investment cost, but we are positive that it will pay off in terms of training and upgrading the skills of our workers.</p><h4>In terms of your portfolio for commercial corporations, what is the split between SMEs and larger domestic companies?</h4><p>Moza Banco has international investors, but it cannot neglect local entrepreneurs and companies. We have a corporate area, a business area, and we have gone into the retail segment. The retail market is a profitable business, and we have to look into the retail banking area—specifically consumer loans, mortgages, and other credit facilities. We provide mortgage loans, but we do not sell them as our major product because we believe they would be difficult to manage in terms of our asset/liability allocation. There is definitely growth potential in the retail segment, and our portfolio has been diversifying since the beginning of 2012 due to geographical and branch expansion. We believe that, as we grow, 25% to 30% of our profits will come from retail banking.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[The Right Formation]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[the-right-formation]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What strategies led you to enter Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Statoil is a young company. We were formed in 1972 and recently celebrated our 40th anniversary. We were originally formed as Norway's state vehicle to explore newly found resources in the North Sea. During the 1970s and 1980s, we were still a 100% state-owned company with activities in Norway. In the late 1980s and early 1990s we began internationalizing our operations and trying to get footholds in different parts of the world. One of these places was Azerbaijan, along with Angola, Algeria, and a few other locations. Today, Azerbaijan is the second largest contributor to our international production—it contributes about 100,000 barrels per day (bbl/d) to a global production of about 2 million bbl/d. About 1.5 million bbl/d come from Norway, and about 20% of our international production comes from Azerbaijan.</p><h4>How would you evaluate your success over the past two decades in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>We have partners at Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli (ACG) and Shah Deniz, which are the two biggest fields in Azerbaijan, both offshore. We don't operate anything here physically—it is BP that operates them and we are partners. We have what is known as a commercial operatorship; we sell gas through the Azerbaijani gas supply company operated by Statoil, which means that we are here selling gas. We also have the South Caucasus Pipeline Company, which is also operated by Statoil—we basically take care of all the administration of running the pipeline, whilst BP physically runs it. We have 60 people in the office. We are small, but it is still a big investment; we have invested more than $6 billion since the beginning of the project. Now, with the new Shah Deniz II project, which is still in the making and hasn't been approved yet, we will be more than doubling our investment in Azerbaijan. It is a major investment for Statoil. In 2013 we are taking the final investment decision, and that is also the communication from SOCAR and BP.</p><div class="quote">“Azerbaijan's position enables it to be a very large and reliable supplier for Europe."</div><h4>What are your priorities here in the future?</h4><p>We are an upstream company. The hydrocarbons lie underground and we are interested in exploring them. We are also the world's largest offshore company, operating more than 3 million bbl/d offshore. That surprises many people. If anyone can expand their presence offshore, we can. We are a 2 million-bbl/d company, which is substantially larger than we were when we entered Azerbaijan in 1992. We are five times bigger than we were then and we have more muscle to take on bigger challenges. We have been a partner here for 20 years, so an operatorship where we are the ones operating the fields is what we are going for. We have no specifics to go on for now, but we hope to get an opportunity to explore in the Caspian.</p><h4>What challenges exist here in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Operating in the Caspian is very challenging, but if you look at our operations outside Norway, with 38-meter waves and Arctic conditions, we can handle strong challenges. The area is geologically young, about 6 million years old. It is still young, still moving, and still settling, which is a challenge when you drill through rock like that. There are challenging environments here and you need to understand the technology and geology relatively well to master it.</p><h4>What ramifications will the Trans-Anatolian Pipeline (TANAP) pipeline have for Statoil?</h4><p>The TANAP will be built eventually and Statoil is considering investing in it. In order to develop a project like Shah Deniz, we need to be able to transport products to the market. Georgia and Turkey are good markets and we are supplying them today. However, if we want to expand, we need to connect to the European market. The TANAP will be a way to connect us to the EU market. It will mean the building of a highway for gas supplies to Europe.</p><h4>How will the TANAP impact the issue of energy security for Europe?</h4><p>In terms of supply to Europe, the TANAP will open up the southern corridor. The first corridor is the Russian supply, the second is the Norwegian supply, the third is the North African supply, and the fourth would be the Caspian supply to Europe, which is an important strategic change for Europe. Right now, the gas markets in Europe and worldwide are quite depressed. Parts of the world have an oversupply of gas and prices are dropping, which affects investment magnitude. Gas as a fuel is, from an energy efficiency point of view, the most efficient energy source that we have. It is less carbon emitting than oil and coal by far. As far as climate change is concerned, gas is the perfect fuel. If you look at the challenges Europe has for carbon emissions, gas is by far the best solution to that problem. If we change coal power plants over to gas, Europe would be 25% below its carbon target for 2020 already. It is not about if they can do it, it's about if there is a will to do it. There will be a will, I am sure, and the demand for gas in Europe is bound to pick up again some time.</p><h4>Are you looking to acquire a stake in the Nabucco West Pipeline?</h4><p>The Shah Deniz consortium is looking, and we are part of that. Right now, the Shah Deniz consortium has a similar agreement with the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP). The Nabucco West Pipeline goes north and the TAP goes straight to Italy. At some point in time during 2013, the consortium will have to choose between Nabucco West and TAP, and, whichever one it chooses, the consortium would like to be co-owners. That is the agreement that is being negotiated. In Norway, we have been owners of the transportation network since it was built, and we have tried to balance our ownership with what we have the resources for. That has proven to be beneficial over time and that is our strategy. We are not a pipeline company, we are an upstream company, but if we have sufficient upstream sources we would like to be owners of the pipeline as well. It is not necessary, but it is preferred.</p><h4>How would you describe Azerbaijan as a regional energy hub in the future?</h4><p>It is a hub for energy in Turkey, the EU, and Europe. Azerbaijan's position enables it to be a very large and reliable supplier for Europe, which is important for Azerbaijan and Europe going forward.</p><h4>What are your medium-term plans for the company?</h4><p>There are three steps; one is to make sure that we continue to be a partner on the Shah Deniz and ACG fields, to develop Shah Deniz II as a new source of energy and transportation to Europe, and seek to introduce new positions within Azerbaijan. That is what we have been working on for a long time, and what we will continue to work on over the medium term.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What will be the impact of the EPA, and what unique advantages does it offer in the current global economic context?</h4><p>The EPA will help the Cariforum region grow and develop economically and sustainably. It will improve conditions for business to flourish and to create even more highly skilled jobs. It will help the Caribbean move up the value chain and rely less on traditional exports, such as bananas and sugar, by creating new trading opportunities in the goods and services sectors, such as business and financial, or tourism including health-related and cultural services industries. The agreement helps consolidate the regional market and establish a transparent and predictable economic framework. This will make the region more competitive and in the end more attractive for investment.</p><h4>How has the EPA developed the EU's relationship with the Latin American &amp; Caribbean region?</h4><p>The EPA is a pioneer trade-for-development partnership between the EU and its 15 Cariforum partners, which include the Caribbean Community and the Dominican Republic. This comprehensive agreement will consolidate and expand our long-standing relations with the region. At the same time, the EPA will support the Caribbean's own regional integration efforts, which are critical to its development. The EPA replaces the previous trading regime that was based on unilateral trade preferences for goods. All in all, the EPA establishes a true partnership combining the full range of trade instruments to promote sustainable economic growth and investment in the Cariforum region.</p><div class="quote">“As EU Trade Commissioner, I want to support our Caribbean partners in their integration into the world economy."</div><h4>Specifically, what benefits are there for European companies to invest in the emerging Latin American and Caribbean market?</h4><p>The Caribbean region is strategically located between North, Central, and Latin America, and it should be able to develop into a springboard to these neighboring markets. The Caribbean Community has embarked on an ambitious regional integration project, aiming to create a single market and economy by 2015. The Dominican Republic enjoys advantageous conditions of trade with the US and other partners in Central America through bilateral trade agreements. The EPA should consolidate relations between the Dominican Republic and its CARICOM partners. Cariforum countries offer a sound business environment, reliable investment protection, and good level of skills and creativity. The EPA opens the goods and services markets, addresses non-tariff barriers, and deals with other trade-related issues, such as competition policy or intellectual property rights. It also reflects the two regions' stages of development, as it requires the EU to take more commitments than its Caribbean partners. For example, the EU offers Caribbean states 100% duty- and quota-free access for all goods, while the Caribbean has up to 25 years to open around 83% of its market.</p><h4>What measures does the EU propose for countries such as the Dominican Republic who face a possible moderate growth in external demand and relatively high imported commodity prices in years to come?</h4><p>As EU Trade Commissioner, I want to support our Caribbean partners in their integration into the world economy through the trading opportunities offered through the EPA. While we cannot make decisions more appropriately taken care of by Cariforum governments, we support their work to establish a sound business environment, stable and transparent investment conditions, and an operational judicial system. We stand ready to co-operate on policies that will enhance the competitiveness of the region and bring benefits to all operators—exporters and importers alike.</p><h4>Which sectors or industries do you feel represent the most potential for EU-Dominican Republic trade relations?</h4><p>In my view, there are many areas that have great potential for trade between the EU and the Dominican Republic. Again, it is not appropriate for me to “pick winners." Tourism has been a major area of activity, which is no surprise given the beautiful beaches, marvelous waters of the Caribbean Sea, fantastic nature, and great cultural sights that this country offers. Certainly, this sector can be further developed. The Dominican Republic has a well-known strong capacity to grow tropical fruit and vegetables, for which it has promoted good outlets through fair trade schemes. But given the geographic position, the specific features of the country, the level of skills, and its other assets, it would seem to me that other sub-sectors are highly promising as well: music or cultural industries could be developed, so could the education or health-based services. On the other hand, there may also be opportunities to produce goods and services for neighboring markets on the American continent. You can also develop to your advantage the region's linguistic assets. You speak languages common to so many countries that are accessible via the EPA.</p><h4>What do you say to European companies that are cautious of protectionism by governments in the region?</h4><p>The EPA establishes a comprehensive partnership between the EU and the Cariforum region. This includes a free trade area, which removes tariffs on all trade over a period of 15 years. The agreement also deals with non-tariff barriers or trade-related issues, such as investment and competition policy. As a matter of principle, EU investors in Cariforum countries benefit from national treatment, which means they enjoy the same conditions as local companies. The implementation of the agreement will be closely monitored by both parties, including through joint institutions, in which any possible issues can be discussed and resolved. In my view, these provisions render protectionist measures much less likely.</p><h4>Europeans are flocking to the region to relocate. How is this beneficial to the European, Latin American, and Caribbean economies?</h4><p>I am not sure that “Europeans are flocking to the region," but European individuals and companies alike certainly take considerable interest in the region. The EPA will help to put the Caribbean more firmly on the map for EU investors. And the region needs to attract more investment to fuel growth and development. That is what the EPA sets out to do: creating better conditions for investors in the Caribbean, be they local or of foreign origin, in order to promote the region's economic development. Today's globalized economies rely on an international division of labor and businesses seek to source parts or tasks from the most competitive location. Inward investment therefore has the potential to be beneficial to both the Caribbean region and the EU. Such investment will create jobs, it enables the transfer of skills and technology, and it will drive economic growth and development in the region. Of course, these investments intend to make the parent company more competitive and profitable. As a result, the company will also be able to create more jobs and wealth both in Europe and in the region long term. Provided the economic activity generated is responsible and sustainable, we should look at this as a “win-win" situation.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[changing-mentalities]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How are local universities like the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN) attempting to connect the provision of higher education to the country's industrial development needs?</h4><p>The IPN was founded in 1936 and emerged from several other schools that existed at that time. The idea was to obtain a synergy that would produce a new institution that was better than those that existed before. The institution was also founded with industrial applications in mind. As a result, we have prepared people to take on the main industrial and economic challenges in the country. At that time, we also covered health and biological aspects that the country needed for the progress of society. We took into consideration that the people coming into the institution would be from the lower-income strata. This is a public school without tuition fees. That permits people without economic mobility to study and gain opportunities to progress. We also prepare people for the specific economic challenges the country faces. Our activity is divided into three main areas: the first is mathematics, physics, and engineering; the second is medical and biological sciences; and the third is economic and administrative sciences. We have 85 different programs for students, and work with other institutes that are complementary to our activities. Most of the employees that are now working in the oil industry are from our institution. Graduates of this institution are involved in building all kinds of infrastructure, including power lines. We have now been working on changing the institution since 2002 through an academic reform project. We reviewed all of the processes that were in operation in terms of academic and social integration. The idea is that the institution maintains a deep interaction with all parts of society. We reviewed the academic model to have the learning processes more centered on the student. Under the new model, the professors function more as guides than traditional teachers. This new model has led to an important change in this institution. This process could not have been put into place without the participation of the teachers, and programs were also put in place to prepare them.</p><h4>How have you been bringing innovation to the Mexican educational market through the development of unique course offerings?</h4><p>Innovation is key to being successful in this field. Each teacher has to find different strategies to work with all of the students. This is also happening in some countries in Europe. It is different from what we regularly see in the education sector in Mexico. As a result, we are focusing on that area of innovation. We are also making some innovations in the way we work with society. For example, we have several incubation centers.</p><div class="quote">“Innovation is key to being successful in this field. Each teacher has to find strategies to work with all of the students."</div><h4>Has access to high-quality and well-recognized tertiary education establishments been improving in Mexico?</h4><p>The main problem in Mexico is the lack of quality in basic education. Even these days, students are simply used to memorization. As a result, they lack the capacity to learn in unique ways. When they arrive, we have to a work on those other cognitive mechanisms and teach them how to use other abilities. That is an enormous problem in a country where 12 million children are enrolled in basic education. To change the mentalities of teachers that are attending those students is very hard. That is our greatest challenge. If we can change this system, we will not have to waste time recovering those abilities when students first join us. We also need to offer more places of study; this is a critical problem in Mexico. The most prestigious private institutions are very expensive for the majority of the population. As a result, people don't have any other choice than to attend public institutions. We need to increase coverage for those people. First we need to create space, and then improve quality.</p><h4>Is more competition in the private sector helping the public sector in terms of a better education offering across the board in Mexico?</h4><p>Yes. There are some private institutions in Mexico that are working offshore and US intuitions that have the agreements and the modality of those institutions in Mexico. This allows them to offer attractive packages. As I understand, around 30% of people studying are in private institutions and 70% are in public institutions. Private education is just fine if the quality is high. Sometimes, this is not how it is. The Ministry of Education also has a difficult time working to control quality due to the bilingual nature of these institutions, which is generally their main offering. However, in the rest of the way that they work, there is no quality. Sometimes, even their English education is bad.</p><h4>How are you expanding your course offerings, and where do the needs lie?</h4><p>We are generating new programs so that we can make a more diversified contribution to the economy as well as areas of research and innovation. I would say that there is a need for interdisciplinary areas. It is now more evident that the areas that cover a single field are less attractive because real life shows that the interaction between several specialties is more productive. We are working more in mechatronics. That is growing more intensively in the country. There is also the combination of biotechnology technology with medical technology. As a result, we are covering these different fields in an interdisciplinary way.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[ready-at-the-beachhead]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why did Yıldırım Holding choose Colombia as its first step into Latin America?</h4><p>BRIC is an acronym invented for the dynamic emerging economies of Brazil, Russia, India, and China, which epitomize economic growth moving from developed to developing countries. However, that was some 10 years ago. The new term being used now is CIVETS, which stands for Colombia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Egypt, Turkey, and South Africa. For years, Colombia had been closed to investors, not only because of its heavily regulated economy, but also due to economic instability and an unstable internal security environment. It has now become the world's fourth biggest exporter of coal, and the country is keen to exploit its mineral resources by giving mining concessions and regulating the industry. Yıldırım Holding made its mark initially in the coal trading business, and we are also very active in coke production in that country. Therefore, it is natural for us to direct our attention to Colombia because of its desire to do business with foreign companies, and we feel that we can bring synergistic capabilities that combine mining, coal trading, coal production, port construction, operation, and erecting energy power plants using coal.</p><h4>What are Colombia's strengths and challenges as a place to invest and do business?</h4><p>Some people say that Colombia is the next Brazil, and from the performance over the last few years we can see that the country is growing at a fast pace. It is the hidden investment gem in South America, opening up to foreign investments and increasing tourism. Much of the growth in the Colombian economy can be attributed to the government focusing on creating a favorable business climate. For example, the ease of doing business index in Colombia is higher than in Brazil. Also, its geographic location on the north-west tip of South America, with ports on both the Caribbean Sea and in the Pacific Ocean, is a major advantage as it provides easy access for imports and exports. To a large extent, the Colombian economy's growth and development has been powered by infrastructure investment. This is welcome news to investors such as Yıldırım Holding because you need roads to haul the minerals or coal and bring them down to the ports for export. One other very valuable feature of Colombia is that it has one of the most qualified workforces in Latin America, with an adult literacy rate of 93%. The labor force is both highly qualified and competitive. However, the labor market suffers from a rigid employment infrastructure.</p><div class="quote">“About a decade ago, Colombia was not known as a mining destination. However, now it is crowded with giant mining companies."</div><h4>Colombia has recently displaced Russia as the largest supplier of thermal coal for power generation. What potential does this imply for Yıldırım's import/export activities?</h4><p>Colombia now ranks as one of the top coal producing countries in the world. We opened our Colombian office back in 2011, and we have been very active in searching for favorable deals with local Colombian coal companies. Our activity will continue unabated regardless of what happens in Russia or in China. Our first energy investment will be the 200 MW coal-fired power plant to be erected next to our Eti Krom ferrochrome production facility in Turkey, and it is most likely that this plant will be using imported coal from Colombia. We have also been very active in 2012 with coal trading and coke in Colombia, and have bid for some major coal and coke contracts in Turkey. We will continue to build on this activity, and seek mutually beneficial opportunities with Colombian producers in the years to come.</p><h4>In 2010, Colombia received upward of $3.24 billion in mining investment. What makes Colombia a favorable destination for exploration?</h4><p>About a decade ago, Colombia was not known as a mining destination. However, now it is crowded with giant mining and exploration companies as well as the smaller junior players, putting the country on track to become an international mining powerhouse. Certainly, the perception that the countryside may not be safe for mining is now changing because Colombia is safe and politically stable. Of course, at the top of the list is coal mining primarily for export purposes, which are operated by hundreds of small coal operators. Aside from coal, Colombia has gold and nickel deposits, and the largest nickel mine in Latin America. The glitter of gold has attracted more of the junior miners. The Colombian government is also encouraging and giving priority for the exploration of phosphates, potassium and magnesium ores, uranium, and iron. The government is encouraging foreign investors to come to Colombia, and the government has set aside close to 3 million hectares of land for exploration. This is welcome news for mining companies such as Yıldırım Holding because we have one of the most established mining records in the world, and we would like to create joint ventures and partnerships with local Colombian partners to do exploration and mining.</p><h4>How are Colombia's new public-private partnership (PPP) laws and increased infrastructure spending shaping potential for port investment and development in the country?</h4><p>In order to become the fourth largest coal exporter in the world, Colombia had to figure out a way to improve its ports and the country's overall infrastructure. To a large extent the growth and development of the country in recent years has been primarily powered by investments made in the infrastructure segment, and the funds for these projects have been raised by PPPs. When it comes to the ports, Cartagena and Buenaventura are the most competitive ports for coking coal. On the other hand, Barranquilla handles more metallurgical coke. There are a few other ports such as Bahí­a Cupica, Bahí­a Solano, Golfo de Tribugá, and Bahí­a Málaga on the Pacific Coast, which will require further port developments. With the recent acquisitions of the Port of Gemlik (Gemport) and the Port of Rota (Rotaport) on the Sea of Marmara in Turkey in 2012, Yıldırım Holding and its subsidiary, Yılport Holding, are now becoming substantial port operators not only locally in Turkey but also globally. It is our intention to explore port construction, development, and operational opportunities in Colombia because we can bring valuable insight and operational expertise as a major up-and-coming global port operator.</p><h4>What is your medium-term outlook for the Colombian economy, and what does this signal for Yıldırım's activities in the country?</h4><p>What the Colombian government has been able to achieve in recent times has certainly been remarkable. A large share of the total investments in the country has been allocated to the oil and mining sectors, and in the improvement of the country's infrastructure, such as highways and ports. Advances in terms of business attractiveness have also been supported by a massive improvement in the security situation, increased financial market stability, and tax incentives. All these factors make us very optimistic regarding the growth prospects of Colombia in the medium term. In 2013 and beyond, we feel Colombia will be able to grow at a healthy pace of 4% to 5% per year, and there will be many opportunities for our company to enlarge our business in Colombia and extend beyond coal trading and coke production. Our synergistic capabilities, having been operating in 10 different sectors in Turkey and elsewhere in the world, furnish us with a unique proposition to bring to Colombia, and that is to provide a “one-stop shop" from mining to logistics, port construction to operations, and coal and coke production to erecting power plants.</p><h4>What is your vision for Yıldırım Holding's global expansion?</h4><p>If one reviews the most successful international companies, one can identify five features which also apply to Yıldırım Holding, and therein lies its vision for global expansion. First, Yıldırım Holding envisioned itself as a global concern from the very beginning as it grew in the 1990s first by trading coal with Russia, and then with China and later with South Africa, and now Colombia. So, in our global vision, there is a commitment to do business globally and utilize global sourcing with active market participation by leveraging our global expertise and partnerships to gain a competitive edge and improve our value-adding market share. Second, is the ability to choose the proper market entry so that you can be profitable and viable very soon. We at Yıldırım Holding firmly believe that our technical, legal, tax, and financial due diligence process has worked well for choosing the right partner, the right project, and the right entry beachhead. Third, the shining international companies are likely to become engaged in joint ventures, acquisitions, manufacturing, and operations overseas closer to their markets. Yıldırım Holding's acquisition of Vargön Alloys, a Swedish ferrochrome manufacturer, in 2008 had this primary objective of producing ferrochrome closer to the European and American stainless steel markets. Fourth, Yıldırım Holding's vision is the commitment to be respectful of local culture and to employ foreign nationals, encouraging multi-country careers and leadership development. The fifth point is to be able to find a happy balance between global and local organizational structure, promote cross fertilization between the center and the commercial units, encourage interconnectedness, bring in the expertise gained from overseas to further enhance the business practices at home, and lead centers of excellence.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does the new round of bidding for blocks in 2013 mean for Mozambique's policies regarding exploration?</h4><p>Today, we have companies working with us in exploration and exploitation activities for hydrocarbons, and other minerals. In terms of hydrocarbons, we have started large-scale natural gas production in the Pande fields. We are producing and exporting gas, as well as using some for domestic production. Our intention is to increase the quantities that we are using internally in Mozambique for power generation and for other utilizations. Basically, apart from the consortium led by Sasol in Pande and Temane, we have other areas in Sofala. We have three contracts for exploration in the blocks of Sofala, M10, and Buzi. The activities are running according to schedule. In the Rovuma Basin we have four blocks offshore under exploration. Three of them are under drilling operations, and while two of them are in more advanced stages than the others, all are on schedule. The intention is to start with natural gas production in 2018 in Rovuma, and I am sure that we will meet this target. We are carrying out technical studies to see if we can launch new blocks for tender, and in 2013 we will open some areas up to the private sector. We needed to investigate our geology in order to hold more effective discussions with the private sector. I believe that we will succeed in this. We need to complete some milestones quicker, meaning we cannot allow for delays. it does not make sense. We need to learn from the results of other tenders and see which areas we will open.</p><h4>What role do your foresee for the National Hydrocarbons Company (ENH) in these new blocks, and with regards to further exploration?</h4><p>In all blocks that we are offering, ENH has participation. We understand that when we talk about resources we need to make sure that the Mozambican people will be the first to benefit. It is why we have ENH for hydrocarbons and the Mozambique Mining Exploration Company (EMEM) for other minerals. There is no difference between the treatment we give to ENH or the Italian group ENI, for example. They all have to comply with the rules and legislation. ENH is part of all the projects, and in the future we can sell some shares to the public in these Mozambican entities.</p><div class="quote">“Mozambique cannot do business without the private sector. For LNG-related projects, PPPs will be important and will be considered."</div><h4>Do you foresee ENH having a larger share, such as 40%, or operating blocks?</h4><p>Today, ENH has between a 5% and 30% share, though maybe in the future it will have more. If ENH has the capacity to do so, then its share will increase; it depends on capacity. If ENH has the capacity to operate at a high level, I do not see problems.</p><h4>CMH is a special purpose vehicle created specifically for operations in the Pande and Temane gas fields with Sasol.  With new onshore gas fields being explored, will its mandate be extended?</h4><p>CMH was created specially as a vehicle for the Pande and Temane project. We will see if CMH will be in the other blocks, or if it will rely only on Pande and Temane. We need to look at the advantages of having CMH in other blocks. We are studying how to deal with this issue because we have ENH, and in the future we will want to sell some shares to the public. We need to see how CMH will fit, or if it will fit into our plans.</p><h4>What role do public-private partnerships (PPP) have in developing the necessary infrastructure to facilitate, export, and benefit from the natural resources in Mozambique?</h4><p>I think that if we want to succeed, a PPP is needed. Mozambique cannot do business without the private sector. For LNG-related projects, PPPs will be important and will be considered. We need to bring together the private sector and the public sector to complement our projects. For the LNG plant, for example, we prefer to have all the companies working together when possible.</p><h4>Another area of exploration is Lake Niassa. How would you characterize your negotiations with Malawi in exploring this area?</h4><p>We do not want to explore the entire country at the same time. We are only concerned with a few areas for the next tender. I am not sure if we will consider Lake Niassa or Rovuma. We are analyzing the data and then we will make a decision.</p><h4>To what extent is vast exploration for minerals detrimental to Mozambique's agricultural sector?</h4><p>The agriculture and mining sectors can coexist. If you go to Moatize, you will find that there are some areas that specialize in agriculture. The question is, where is the best place to specialize in agriculture? If you go to Angónia, a district in the northern part of Tete for example, the agriculture sector is excellent; however, unfortunately I do not know if there is coal, but if there is coal in Angónia, it will be great for the next generation. It is a question of balance, to see how best to use the resources that we have.</p><h4>What would you say are the key points that investors should be aware of with regards to the new petroleum law?</h4><p>I think that our legislation is excellent. We are trying to review some issues in order to fill in some gaps, but the revisions will still be attractive to investors. I have many companies queued up to come to Mozambique. The investors must be sure that what we want in Mozambique is to give them rights to explore; however, we want to have benefits from the exploration activities. It does not make sense if a company spends $10 million on a license and for business reasons it goes to a stock exchange in London or Sydney and sells it for $1 billion. The Mozambican people do not benefit from that. The legislation ensures that the assets are here in Mozambique; it is a question of a balance of benefits, both to the Mozambican people and the investors. I know that in other countries when you want to relinquish the license you do not have the right to transfer your rights to another person. Here in Mozambique, we allow this opportunity. If you do not want to continue, then it is business, you can transfer your rights, but we want to have some benefit from the transfer.</p><h4>Is there a need to renegotiate contracts?</h4><p>Contracts are contracts. It is a business venture that two parties need to discuss and reach an agreement. When you do business you are prepared to talk anytime about what you have signed, and what you want to have. Our contracts are new; the only contracts that were signed 10 years ago are those with Sasol and Kenmare. All the other contracts are just three or four years old. We need to balance what we want to gain through renegotiations.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>In the middle of the 1850s Ludvig Nobel, elder brother to the world famous inventor and creator of the Nobel Prize, Alfred Nobel, established a mechanical factory in St Petersburg producing grenades with a new technology. He later followed this with cannons, rifles, and gun carriages. The company was soon to become one of the largest suppliers to the Russian army and the beginning of a tremendous success story, which would be largely unknown to most people outside Russia and Azerbaijan. Working together with Ludvig was his older brother Robert. He was sent to the Caucasus region on a mission to find walnut wood for rifle stocks to fill an order of 200,000 rifles for the Russian army. Arriving in Baku, he discovered that oil was literally bubbling out of the ground, and he realized that there was a great opportunity in the oil business. He returned to St Petersburg and managed to convince Ludvig to invest in Baku. In 1875, the first Nobel refinery was inaugurated under the name Bra Nobel. Alfred was also called upon to invest in the company, which he did. They could never have realized at the time that by 1917 Bra Nobel would be the second largest oil company in the world.</p><p>The Russian revolution abruptly ended the almost 80-year-long success story of the Nobel family in Azerbaijan and Russia. Ludvig, being a scientist, inventor, and entrepreneur as well as a businessman, quickly saw the potential in this new business as well as its problems. One major problem that he could identify was logistics. At that time, oil was transported in leather sacks or wooden barrels by camels and donkeys—not a very efficient means of transportation. He, therefore, designed and built the first oil tanker, the Zoroaster, the first in a fleet of 40 oil tankers. He laid the first pipeline in Azerbaijan to Russia, built special railway wagons for oil, introduced steam engines in the oil fields, built the first depots for oil and kerosene in Russia, introduced the first electrical plant in the Caucasus, and pioneered new modern drilling technics. Bra Nobel became one of the first fully vertically integrated companies in the world.</p><div class="quote">“In a cradle-to-cradle perspective, the Trust is also working on the establishment of a science park for clean technology in Baku."</div><p>Another important success factor was his sense of corporate responsibility. As a visionary leader, Ludvig improved the conditions of his workers by shortening working hours, and building schools, housing, healthcare, and recreational facilities. He opened a cooperative bank and introduced a pension system. Overall, 40% of the company's profit was returned back to its employees. Sustainability and social commitment became the trademarks of Nobel industries. After his death in 1888 his oldest son, Emanuel, continued in the same spirit and developed the company even further up to the very end of its existence. It must also be mentioned that without the efforts of Emmanuel there would probably not have been any Nobel Prize. He insisted that Alfred's last will should be respected, and bought all of his shares in Bra Nobel.</p><p>The Russian revolution in 1917 changed the scene dramatically. All of the Nobel industries and properties were confiscated by the new regime. The family was forced to flee the country under dramatic circumstances and leave everything behind. With the help of loyal employees they managed to return to Sweden, safe but empty handed. Today in Azerbaijan, almost 100 years later, the Nobel name is highly respected and the ordinance set by Ludvig for Bra Nobel lives on in the oil business.</p><p>The Nobel heritage has been restored today thanks to the Baku Nobel Heritage Fund (BNHF), founded by Dr Togrul Bagirov. In 2008, the old family residence in Villa Petrolea, Baku, was inaugurated after a total restoration, funded by BNHF. Many members of the Nobel family participated in the inauguration. The villa is today a Nobel museum as well as a place for receptions, weddings, and other events, as well as hosting the Baku Nobel Oil Club (BNOC) with members like SOCAR, BP, and Statoil. Members of the family frequently return to a rapidly changing Baku and Villa Petrolea, both for social and business activities. One such activity is the digitalization of the old archives of Bra Nobel by the National Board of Archives, the Centre for Business History in Stockholm (CBHS), and BNHF in cooperation with the Nobel Family Society. The Nobel Sustainability Trust is a family initiative aiming to crystalize and extend global awareness and focus on environmental considerations and solutions to ensure access to energy for all members of society whilst ensuring the protection of the earth. The work of the trust is in the spirit of Ludvig, and its main pillars are the Sustainability Award, the Sustainable Energy Conference, and the Nobel Sustainability Fund. Over the last three years, the Trust has participated in the Caspian Oil and Gas Conference as a keynote speaker stressing the need for renewable and sustainable energy to replace fossil fuel. In a cradle-to-cradle perspective, the Trust is also working on the establishment of a science park for clean technology in Baku. This project is well in line with the mega project, initiated by President Ilham Aliyev, transforming Baku from the “Black City" to the “White City."</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess the evolution of the real estate sector in Colombia?</h4><p>We've been steadily growing for the last 10 years, and it is the first time that we are growing not only because of internal demand, but also because of business coming into the country. Colombia experienced a decrease in interest in the 1990s, and that made us learn a lot about how companies need to manage crises within their boundaries on their own. We were, therefore, very prepared for the global financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, even with banks in the US, Spain, the UK, and Australia coming down hard in terms of real estate. We've avoided the worst, but we can't forget about the crisis we had in Colombia from 1995 to 2001. There was a very bad crisis throughout the country, and we managed to survive. At that point we had a lot of problems with the banks, and we had a large interest bubble, so we experienced the same problems in real estate that the US and Europe had in 2006-2008. Since we had experienced this in the late 1990s, we had learned and were nearly untouched by the crisis in 2009. What has happened is that we have a healthy economy, and we're being looked at in a different way by most international investors. Politically we are very stable, but we have a lot more reasons to remain concerned about what is going on around the country in terms of the economy, security, and controls on handling cocoa crops. The world is in turmoil, and this makes countries like Colombia attractive for investors looking to grow businesses. Plus, the next generation of Colombians, educated abroad, are returning to Colombia in much greater numbers than they did in the 1990s. Now that they are coming back they are managing and generating huge interest from their peers working in real estate funds, which is a very popular method for accumulating wealth in today's world. Many real estate and construction companies are basing their future growth on real estate funds. This makes a big difference also because we're not simply thinking about initial sales or presales to fund projects anymore. Now we're getting new and fresh money to build projects, and then evaluating which markets will be able to buy mature products in four or five years. This is another way of enhancing property value. With regard to retail, office space, hotels, and industrial space, we have been selling everything piece by piece. This is how the sector operated until about five years ago, when builders and investors began to keep properties with the intention of renting or offering them to different funds, such as pension managers. This development is changing the whole spectrum and horizon of the real estate sector in Colombia, and it will bring more and bigger investors to the country.</p><h4>Fiduciary rights are becoming more popular with local investors. What advantages do these rights offer?</h4><p>This is not exactly a new medium of sales and financing. Our company began the fiduciary or trust style of sales 20 years ago. We were the first company in Colombia to do this, and we successfully brought this model to Ecuador. However, when we took it to Panama, people didn't pursue it. At that point the biggest problem was that we didn't have the money to fund whole projects, and we had to go to small investors to get them to fund pieces of a project. At this time, maybe from 1991 to 1993, individual hotel suites, which might cost $50,000 to $60,000 per unit, were significant investments for small investors. We divided the units into five or six parts to make it easier for people to get into the market and expand it. Now people can get into the real estate sector or hotel business by paying only a fifth of a room; this is the basis of the fiduciary trust system. When we began doing this we had a lot of success because we could bring investors with just $5,000 or $7,000, and let them gain access to the profits of a high-yield business with only a small investment. That was a big hotel investment title (HIT) at that point. We did very well in the 1990s with this model and sold many hotels in this manner, including all of the Sheraton hotels in Colombia. This model hasn't changed, and it is still a valid model for raising money for a project. However, it is just one of many tools that we have for raising funds. National and international investment funds are playing a bigger role nowadays, particularly because it is difficult to put the property together again for one person. This is a weakness of the fiduciary trust system; it's nearly impossible to sell the whole property. New funds still use something similar to fiduciary trusts, but they have mechanisms for allowing single ownership over an entire property. While large investors are looking for stability and long-term growth, smaller investors are looking for monthly gains. We have to be very careful because the fiduciary system can be problematic in a couple of ways. The first is if we set the price of the property too high, and the second is if developers give small investors the wrong data. It is sad, but this is something that has happened in and around Bogotá.</p><div class="quote">“Many real estate and construction companies are basing their future growth on real estate funds."</div><h4>With 20 years of experience in the hotel sector and developing large projects such as Sheraton and Capital Towers, what are you expecting with your latest project?</h4><p>We've had several good years; we've been growing steadily for more than six years. About two years ago we decided to focus mainly on hotels. Even though we do some residential, second-home, and retirement developments, our main focus in the current period is hotels. We just opened the first hotel, the Tryp Hotel. This was recently bought by Wyndham, a US company. It is a neat, clean chain with attractive offerings for normal business people, such as the right colors, amenities, price, convenience, and comfort. We just opened this hotel, and it has a beautiful location in front of the US Embassy. This is a great location because it is safe and close to the airport. We're planning to open the others in the coming months. We also operate hotels through a management company called Diplomat Hotels, and we are pursuing many more opportunities. Colombia is similar to a child that is beginning to grow, and we want to nurture this growth. Colombia is a new economy. Although we have 200 years of independence, we opened ourselves to the world in 1991 with a new constitution. We were looking inward—we didn't interact well with the outside world in the past, and there were only a few immigrants moving to Colombia. This was the result of a lack of vision from past policy makers. In my opinion, immigrants are an important aspect of growing a prosperous country. We need immigrants—they are the people who will take new jobs and fight for the future of the country. Recent changes have led to more openness in the economy, and we are seeing international franchises move in to compete with established Colombian businesses. This competition and growth is good for our economy overall.</p><h4>What are you expecting from the hotel that your company is planning to develop on San Andrés Island?</h4><p>We aim to have the land secured by the end of 2012 and then begin construction in 2013. It's going to be a four- or five-star hotel with its own beach. San Andrés used to be the only free port in Colombia. In 1991, the Constitution changed, opening up our economy. This allowed us to deal in US dollars and open dollar accounts, as well as import many more products. This meant that we didn't have to go to San Andrés to get a TV or other imported items. San Andrés' position declined after this change. However, in the last five years there has been a lot of rejuvenation in the San Andrés region.</p><h4>What other main projects are you working on?</h4><p>We are working on a boutique hotel project in Cartagena. It is called the Santa Catalina, and it will be the third-largest hotel in the walled city with more than 40 rooms. The houses that make up the hotel are older than the walls themselves, dating back to the 16th century and giving the hotel a unique atmosphere. At the same time, we plan to continue to develop our partnerships with Wyndham and Tryp Hotels. We also aim to partner with AC by Marriott. Marriott is a highly regarded brand in Colombia, and we're hoping to help it develop franchises throughout the country. The AC line is a strong brand; Antonio Catalan is a hands-on designer in hotel development. We've also been investing in a number of small projects in oil-related services. We currently have 54 potential projects, and we expect to add about 10 more projects to this portfolio in 2013.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize Nestlé's role in Turkey's consumer goods market over the past century?</h4><p>With our products having had a presence in Turkey since the 19th century and Nestlé opening its operations here in Istanbul officially in 1909, I think we can safely say that we are an integral part of the progression and development of the Turkish consumer goods market. In fact, the very first chocolate factory in Turkey was a Nestlé factory, built in 1927. Furthermore, we have had many firsts in Turkey: the first infant formula, the first chocolate factory, several other firsts in chocolate products, the first soluble coffee, and many others. For more than one century we have been accompanying Turkish society in its development with our products and services. This, by the way, is not unusual for Nestlé but rather the rule, given our long-standing presence in many parts of the world. Nestlé's traditions have not changed much. We are still an innovator looking for the next stage of development. Originally, that was simply providing safe and nutritious year-round packaged food products. Today, Nestlé is the world's leading nutrition, health, and wellness company, with our product portfolio continuously evolving to provide the best nutrition solutions for each consumer's needs. These products include breakfast cereals with a vitamin mix conducive to the growth requirements of children, special nutrition tailored for elderly people, special nutrition for athletes, and also some wonderful indulgent chocolate or a cup of stimulating coffee for the right moment. Our focus is on individualized nutrition, providing the opportunity for everyone at every level of society to access nutrition, health, and wellness. Our role as an innovator is the same, but now the tools are different.</p><h4>Have the demands of Turkish consumers changed over the past 10 years?</h4><p>Turkey now has an annual per capita income above $10,000, which represents a three fold increase over the past decade. Generally, once a country breaks the $3,000 barrier, a different type of market starts to build up—lifestyles and habits change. For example, 50% of the people on our board of directors are women. Nearly all of them have children, but they have little time for cooking. This means that the market experiences changing demands, and we have to cater to the needs of society. With the income rise, there is also a rise in out-of-home consumption for which the consumer has more choices than ever before. To be fully involved in a working life today, many people consume their meals out of the house, and if not they require convenient solutions to delight the family at home. That influences the way we are able to serve our consumers.</p><div class="quote">“There are more and more people benefiting from the progress Turkey as a country is continuing to achieve."</div><h4>What is the significance of Turkey to Nestlé as an international brand?</h4><p>Turkey is part of a development market cluster, where we represent a key focus area. Historically and geographically at the crossroads of continents and cultures, Turkey  in Nestlé represents both a bridge and a learning ground for other markets. Of course, we also fully apply our global knowledge and learning in Turkey. Today, with rising income levels and a stable environment, Turkey is very conducive to our business development and our industry. It is also a very competitive market. From a revenue perspective, Turkey is already a mid-level market.</p><h4>The idea of creating shared value is an important part of Nestlé's business model globally. How does Nestlé work to create shared value in Turkey?</h4><p>We play an important role in contributing to society by creating shared value, which means that our business activities need to create value for society at large in order to be sustainable in the long term. And where better to do this than in the food segment? Our raw materials are sourced from rural society, and our DAMAK pistachio chocolate is a good example. The pistachio is grown in Gaziantep, widely regarded as the global gene center for pistachios. Over the past few years, pistachio yields have been falling rapidly. As a result, we are in a situation where a pistachio tree in Gaziantep may be yielding only 2-3 kilograms versus the 20 kilograms from trees in places like Iran and the US. We use pistachios from Gaziantep for DAMAK chocolate, and we want to continue to do so. Therefore, we invested $1.5 million in an NGO in Gaziantep to increase pistachio yields, and by 2014 we expect yields to be around eight kilograms. As a result, we support a rural society that can live off its own produce and use a sustainable source for the crucial raw materials for our production. What is good for our shareholders is also good for society at large, not to forget the consumer who is in the center of our efforts. We have three focus areas in terms of creating shared value. The first is water sustainability because water is obviously an important raw material in creating all of our products. The second is rural development, once again because we source our raw materials from rural environments. Having sustainable sources and a healthy rural environment helps us also to sell our products by creating strong economies. There are about 1 billion people in the world progressing in the next few years from the bottom to the middle of the global wealth pyramid. The third element in creating shared value is nutrition, which is the business we are in as the global leading nutrition, health, and wellness company, which is basically about offering the right food at the right time in the right amount, following our global slogan, “Good Food Good Life." This is what we focus on and where we spend our resources. We are working in partnership with the Ministry of Education on a project to teach primary school kids about good nutrition. The project is not branded—we are simply aiming to promote education about good nutrition, which we believe will help prevent diseases related to the wrong diet.</p><h4>What trends do you foresee in nutritional consumer goods in Turkey?</h4><p>We are not living in a homogeneous environment. Turkey is more than Istanbul, and we have to employ a regional approach. There are more and more people benefiting from the progress Turkey as a country is continuing to achieve. We are impressed by the government's vision and the direction given, with the goal of Turkey to become a top-10 global economy by 2023. As we are basically everywhere in the world, and our business is closely related to the GDP and population of a country, with Turkey  aspiring to be a top-10 economy globally then this vision and aspiration is equally energizing for us at Nestlé Turkey. The way to achieve that is to support consumers in more rural and less affluent areas to develop their nutritional needs while also catering to the wealthier people in Turkey's main cities. This could mean marketing a super premium Nespresso to the Istanbul elite and a special single-serve Nescafé in a less affluent area. We want to capture new consumers who are moving up in the FMCG segment and nutritional consumer goods. For us, this two-pronged approach will remain relevant for quite some time to come and we predict that both segments will see substantial growth opportunities for many. It's not going to be easy, but it's an opportunity for sustainable growth.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>TBY talks to Moritz Hartmann, General Manager Middle East at Roche Diagnostics, on operations in Dubai, How have Roche's operations in Dubai evolved?</h4><p>We received our trade license in January 2012, and our first milestone was to go commercially live in July. This is basically an internal process that allows us to buy and sell our products in the region through this office. That means Roche Diagnostics Middle East Regional Company is now the commercial partner of all our distributors in the region. This first milestone was met and from there we have launched some initiatives that are part of the overall concept. Among other things, in September 2012, we kicked off our Middle East marketing team, to transfer all market support activity to Dubai for the 20 countries in the Middle East. Before this, the marketing experts in the export department in Germany were covering the region as part of a portfolio of 70 markets, including Eastern Europe, most parts of Africa and the Middle East. Now we have specialized marketing and product management, focusing on the specific needs of the Middle East. In November 2012, we launched our regional warehouse in Jebel Ali, where we now centrally store the products designated to the region, allowing us to act faster and more reliably. We are also controlling a longer part of the distribution chain. Previously, we were sending the goods out of our central warehouse in Europe, so the moment the goods left the warehouse there, they were in the hands of our distributers. Now, we carry the whole responsibility until here, which improves quality control over the supply chain. This is not only about costs, but it is primarily about better serving customers.</p><h4>How does Roche fit into the vision of improving the infrastructure of Dubai?</h4><p>On the one hand, the goal of introducing the support functions here is to create a close link to the knowledge of our company, which is future products, medical know-how, and the significance of diagnostic testing, which has in the past been transferred from Germany to our distribution partners. Right now, we are taking this on actively here. We have established a group of experts here that will serve healthcare professionals in a far more intensive way. We want to be understood as the partners of the Ministry of Health or the Dubai Health Authority, so that when it comes to in-vitro diagnostics, we are the ones with the greatest knowledge. We are happy to share this with people who request it, and we actively want to bring our know-how to the market. This aligns very well with the vision of HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.</p><div class="quote">“Diversity is an important factor in our strategy of innovation."</div><h4>Are you seeing demand in your sector from doctors for more advanced equipment?</h4><p>Our customers are mostly healthcare providers, and we are seeing an increasing demand for high-quality healthcare services. They request from us the delivery of the latest technology in the same timeframe that we are launching this technology in any other part of the world. Other parts of the world worry whether they can afford the latest technology; however, that is never a problem here. Upgrading the quality of the healthcare system comes with a price tag, and many governments make no compromise about increasing services to the people. Our goal is to be able to serve customers here with a global level of service expected from Roche, irrespective of the fact that distributors are an additional part of the supply chain.</p><h4>What strategies do you have in place to capitalize on the healthcare boom?</h4><p>Our strategy is to establish ourselves here with an affiliate of the company. In the in-vitro diagnostics business, we are the first company to do this. Internally, Dubai is getting tremendous attention. Nowadays, we are referring to the Middle East in the same way as we talk of emerging markets such as Brazil or Russia. If we look at how many blood parameters are tested in a patient per year, the GCC countries are still behind the standards that we see in North America or Western Europe. However, the past trend was to go to the EU or the US for treatment, but I think this will reverse. We will increasingly see the top destinations in the region become the preferred places to seek treatments, also when it comes to complicated matters. This is part of the latest developments that we are seeing in Dubai. Medical tourism is one of the focuses. Because of budgetary constraints in the EU and the US, we will see that the top-notch equipment that is here will make a difference, and this is why there will be more people taking an active decision to be treated here rather than elsewhere.</p><h4>How important is perception in convincing people of the quality of health care in the region?</h4><p>Trust will come in time, and that is the only thing at the moment that is missing. People in the US will often go to clinics that are managed by leading providers in the US. You will find places in Abu Dhabi like that. There are international hospital operators that are putting their standards from the US in the UAE one-to-one. As a supplier, we are requested to meet the same standards as in the US to service the same protocols in the hospitals here.</p><h4>How did you achieve 25% market penetration across the Middle East, and what is your outlook for the coming years?</h4><p>We have achieved this by working very successfully with our distribution partners in each country. We have maintained relationships for many decades with them; in Saudi Arabia, we will be celebrating 50 years of partnership with our distributor in 2013. This long, trusted partnership has allowed us to share knowledge and serve the markets better than other competitors, who were only seeing the markets as an export business. This is not how Roche does business; we are a company with a long history of over 115 years, and we do our business for the long term. We have been committed for many years, and with moving here, we are taking the next step to lead our industry.</p><h4>Is stability why Roche chose Dubai?</h4><p>Yes. At this moment, we consider Dubai able to provide us with the infrastructure needed to host our regional headquarters. In the very specialized fields, it is difficult for us to recruit the right talent, and that is one of the main reasons we are in Dubai. We are always evaluating our options, and maybe one day we will have a warehouse in Saudi Arabia to serve that market better. I foresee this happening in the near future. We evaluated the situation, together with our partners, and came to the conclusion that for the time being, Dubai is the right place.</p><h4>What was your message to attendees at the Women's Leadership Forum (WIL) conference in November 2012?</h4><p>Diversity is an important factor in our strategy of innovation. At Roche, we believe only diversity will allow us to continue to be at the cutting edge of innovation. We renew our product portfolio every five years and diversity for us is a key to generate enough ideas to keep this pace of innovation.. The previous organizational structures we had in the GCC were very male-dominated, and since we established our own affiliate we have been fully implementing our global strategy of diversity in the Middle East organization. We were able to increase the number of female employees by almost 50%. The WIL was important for us, because people heard that we are serious about making change happen, and that we believe that this is part of what we want to achieve globally. Women do want to work here, but still face a lot of obstacles. As a company, we provide an inclusive work environment and do not differentiate, for example, in salaries or allowances between male and female employees. It is part of the company's cultural values, and I was impressed by the positive reactions we received at the forum for implementing them.</p><h4>Do you have a set goal for diversity in your company?</h4><p>We have a global target, but that is actually lower than what we need. There is a lot of controversy in our company about this target. I personally think it is not overly ambitious, but it is there to raise awareness and to give the whole topic of diversity a certain importance and visibility. In fact, in the Middle East, our numbers are better than the global target. But this target is not about achieving or overachieving; it is just about finding the right talent.</p><h4>What are your company targets for 2013?</h4><p>In the Middle East, 2013 is the year of our customers. We want our customers to feel what the concept of putting our regional management here means and what it delivers to them. We used 2012 to put the infrastructure and concept into place, and 2013 should be the year that customers feel the difference. Our long-term goal in the region is to become the partner of choice for in-vitro diagnostics. We want to be the ones that are referred to not only for making profits in the market, but for giving back to the community.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did CEMEX grow to become the global leader in cement production that it is today?</h4><p>We have to go back to 1906 to a town called Hidalgo, in Nuevo León, where we built our first local cement production plant. During the first 80 years of CEMEX's history, the company was mostly active in the local market, and it expanded activities across the country. In 1985, when Lorenzo Zambrano took over as CEO of the company, CEMEX started focusing on cement production and it implemented a very aggressive business strategy to achieve growth. At the end of the 1980s, the company went from being a local producer to the leading company in terms of production in the entire country after acquiring Cementos Anáhuac and Cementos Tolteca. By that time, CEMEX had also started operating in the southern markets of the US. This completely changed the profile of the company for the better. Between 1991 and 1995, CEMEX started its real international expansion. In 1992 we acquired business activities in Spain, which represented our first steps in the European market. We also entered Central and South American markets such as Venezuela, where we acquired Vencemos, Panama, where we acquired Bayano, and some other Caribbean operations including the Dominican Republic. Around that time, CEMEX also entered the Asian market through the Philippines, where we acquired two companies. In this regard, I would like to stress the importance of two events in the mid-1990s that consolidated our operations worldwide: the acquisition of Balcones, a cement plant in the US, and the acquisition of Colombia's Cementos Diamante and Samper. After these acquisitions, CEMEX became the third largest cement company in the world. In the following years up until the early 2000s, the company kept focusing on expanding its activities in foreign markets, especially in Central and South America. We consolidated our activities in Asia, and we also entered the Egyptian market. In 2005, CEMEX doubled its size with the acquisition of British RMC, adding mainly 15 European markets to its portfolio. After that, in 2007, CEMEX acquired Rinker, which significantly expanded our activities in the US. In the last stage of our long journey, the company also diversified its product portfolio, adding concrete and aggregate production to its cement activity. Today, CEMEX is a global company that holds a leading position in the cement, concrete, and aggregate production and commercialization industries. We have direct operations in over 50 countries, and other commercial ties with more than 100 countries. CEMEX currently employs 44,000 people.</p><h4>What role does Mexico continue to play in CEMEX's extensive global operations?</h4><p>It still remains a very important part of our business activity. During the first six months of 2012, Mexico represented 23% of our overall sales activity. Mexico is the largest country we operate in. Mexico, the US, Northern Europe, and South America are the main areas of activity for CEMEX at the moment. Mexico is also an important base of operations to supply materials to neighboring countries such as Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador, as well as Paraguay, Peru, Ecuador, Chile, and even the US.</p><div class="quote">“CEMEX will keep its market-oriented focus, while trying to develop mechanisms that strengthen the position of our clients."</div><h4>What role has the construction materials sector played in widening Mexico's base as an industrial hub?</h4><p>The construction materials sector currently represents around 5% of Mexico's GDP. Investment in infrastructure in Mexico, which is still deficient, has played a vital role in the economic and social development of the country, and it has also attracted many foreign investors. Therefore, the construction materials sector has contributed to leveraging industrial production capacities in the country, generating job opportunities for the local population and industrializing the production of housing. However, the country still lags behind in both infrastructure and housing development.</p><h4>What are the main infrastructure projects CEMEX is currently involved in, and what kind of trends have you observed in terms of project demand?</h4><p>There are three main projects CEMEX has been working on, including the development and professionalization of our distribution network, as well as the development of new products that facilitate the construction process. Therefore, we have evolved into a company providing full and integral construction solutions. We have professionalized our network, especially the retail stores, via marketing, operations, and management technique training. The other main project had to do with the special emphasis we put on developing infrastructure projects through providing integral solutions to our clients. For example, last year we completed over 7.8 million sqm of road paving in Mexico, and we are trying to export this business model to other countries as well. Finally, we complemented these activities with the development of housing projects. We aim to introduce more industrialized techniques into the construction of housing. In addition, we have also focused on diversifying our product portfolio in order to provide our customers with more detailed and appropriate products for their needs. CEMEX has R&amp;D centers in Mexico and Switzerland that constantly work to develop more efficient products from an energy and environmental point of view.</p><h4>How will the new kiln at the cement plant in Puebla assist your operations?</h4><p>At the moment, we are halfway through this investment project, and I believe it will contribute to expanding the company's business activity, for it will produce 10,000 tons of clinker a day. We expect to have it finished within 16 to 18 months, and the new kiln will increase the total production capacity of the Tepeac plant in Puebla to 7.4 million metric tons of cement per year. Its development also depends on the evolution of the market.</p><h4>How important is it for the company to have sustainable practices in place?</h4><p>Sustainability is a key issue for CEMEX, and we have always committed ourselves to having the best international standards, such as ISO 14000, when it comes to environmentally friendly practices. We constantly look for ways to reduce our CO2 emissions across the production chain through, for example, the use of alternative fuels. In fact, around 25% of CEMEX's energy consumption comes from alternative fuels, and we aim to increase this figure to up to 35% by 2015. Our Eurus project, a 250-MW wind farm, supplies approximately 25% of our Mexican plants' annual electricity needs. In other words, we have reduced CO2 emissions by 23% for each ton of cement. These are just some examples of our sustainable practices. We have also reduced lost-time injury rates from 7% in 2006 to 2.3% in 2011. We have cut CO2 emissions per cement ton and we aim to increase the use of alternative raw materials up to 12% by 2015.</p><h4>What are the main growth strategies of the company at the global level?</h4><p>The company will maintain its focus on developing and expanding its business in its three main areas of activity: cement, ready-mix concrete, and aggregate. CEMEX will keep its market-oriented focus, while trying to develop mechanisms that strengthen the position of our clients. In the next couple of years, we expect to experience organic growth while taking advantage of the potential opportunities the market might offer. In addition, we will continue promoting the development of infrastructure projects not only in Mexico, but at the international level too. Finally, CEMEX is committed to continue implementing a value-before-volume business strategy worldwide, as well as environmentally friendly practices.</p><h4>What's your general outlook for the economy of Mexico in 2013?</h4><p>There will be some changes at the political and economic level in Mexico as the new government takes over. We are optimistic about the future ahead, and we believe that the newly elected government is committed to implementing the policies and structural reforms the country needs. For example, Mexico needs to introduce structural changes and reforms in the energy sector, as well as in the fiscal and labor framework. We expect the newly elected government will find the ground to introduce such reforms and put the country on the right path to grow and develop at a faster pace. Mexico has a bright and promising future ahead, as proved by the strong position of our economy at the moment.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[cycle-balance]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the milestones for Banco de la República over 2012?</h4><p>The primary objective of monetary policy in Colombia is to maintain price stability. The operational target of monetary policy is an annual consumer price inflation of 3%. At the same time, monetary policy is intended to keep economic growth on a sustainable path. In order to achieve these objectives, Colombia applies a countercyclical monetary policy, whereby the interest rate is raised whenever economic growth exceeds its potential or either the inflation forecast or expectations for it surpass the target. Interest rate reductions are made when the opposite conditions prevail. This helps to prevent inflationary pressures at the peak of the cycle and to avoid an excessive redundancy of resources at the bottom of it. By the beginning of 2012, a positive output gap had been identified. Moreover, different types of credit—particularly consumer credit—were growing at a high rate. There was a risk that this situation would intensify if left unchecked and pose a risk to the achievement of the inflation target. Accordingly, during the first two months of this year, the Board of Directors of the Banco de la República continued raising the policy interest rate until it attained a peak of 5.25%. This tightening started in February 2011 when the projections for both inflation and GDP growth as well as the behavior of domestic demand and consumer credit led the Board to conclude that the Colombian economy no longer needed the support of a 3% interest rate, which had been provided in the context of the international crisis of 2008-09. During the second half of 2012, economic activity started to show clear symptoms of deceleration. The latest information shows that GDP growth in the third quarter (on an annual basis) was 2.1%, well below the economic performance observed during the first six months. Although some slowing down of the economy was expected given the previous tightening of monetary policy and the effects of the European crisis, this weakening turned out to be worse than expected. To some extent external factors, such as weaker demand and lower prices for our commodities exports, explain this result. However, domestic factors also played an important role, with the shrinkage of public investment and private construction. Following its inherent countercyclical role, monetary policy reacted by reducing the policy interest rate to a level of 4.25% by year-end.  This lower rate is expected to eventually provide a renewed stimulus to economic activity during 2013. The inflation rate has continued falling so that, by the end of November, the annual inflation rate was 2.77%, which is below the long-term inflation target of 3%. This absence of inflationary pressures allows the Central Bank to provide monetary stimulus to the economy without risking the probability of reaching the inflation target. This, in fact, is reflected in inflation expectations that are firmly anchored around the long-term target of 3% in both the short term and medium term according to the latest surveys. It is also true of the break-even inflation derived from public bonds traded on the stock market.</p><h4>What are your expectations in terms of the trade balance?</h4><p>We are expecting a current account deficit of around 3% of GDP in both 2012 and 2013. This is mostly explained by the moderate dynamics of Colombian exports as a result of decreasing prices and quantities due to the weak growth of the US economy—our main trading partner—and the contraction in the eurozone. Since the 2004, the Colombian economy has received a substantial amount of FDI, which has increased at an average annual rate of 22% over the last six years and nowadays represents more than 4% of GDP. As a matter of fact, the strong increase in FDI is one of the main reasons behind the current account deficit in Colombia.</p><h4>What are your plans for monetary and financial policies in 2013?</h4><p>In the context of the flexible inflation targeting framework that Colombia has followed since 1999, the guidelines for monetary policy are well established and publicly known. As stated above, the Banco de la República is committed to price stability and, more precisely, to an inflation target of 3%, which the monetary authorities publicly reaffirmed for 2013. Monetary policy also seeks to maintain sustainable economic growth that is close to the potential productive capacity of the economy, which is estimated to be in a range of 4% to 5%. Accordingly, monetary policy will continue playing its key countercyclical role of avoiding situations of excess demand and providing timely support if the economy weakens. In a broader context, the recent experience of developed countries has shown that price stability is not a guarantee of financial stability. Therefore, in addition to its countercyclical role, the Banco de la República should emphasize macro-prudential issues aimed at preventing excessive risk taking by financial institutions. That is the reason the Banco de la República tries to prevent the interest rate from deviating from its “normal" level over significant and prolonged periods of time, so that it does not stimulate excessive risk taking or unsustainable increases in asset prices and in leverage. In addition, the Banco de la República is conscious that the presence of large currency mismatches in the financial sector is a source of financial vulnerability and limits the ability to float without significant restrictions. Such mismatches could also be a heavy constraint for allowing the degree of exchange rate flexibility considered necessary for maintaining monetary policy independence. Accordingly, foreign loans obtained by local financial intermediaries may only be used to fund assets denominated in the same currency and with a maturity that is less than or equal to that of the loans.</p><div class="quote">“During the recent worldwide financial crisis, the Colombian economy showed remarkable resilience."</div><h4>Despite international uncertainty, how do you reassure investors that Colombia is a prime investment destination?</h4><p>During the recent worldwide financial crisis, the Colombian economy showed remarkable resilience. Colombia not only managed to grow 1.7% in 2009—while many emerging economies shrank—but also achieved a quick recovery in 2010 and 2011 by growing 4% and 5.9%, respectively. This satisfactory growth performance, despite the difficult external conditions, demonstrated that Colombia's economic fundamentals were strong, and that the policy reaction to the crisis was timely and appropriate. As a result, foreign investor confidence in the Colombian economy increased and the main rating agencies declared Colombia investment grade country in early 2011. The role of monetary policy in attaining the results described above was crucial. By reducing the policy rate from 10% to 3% over a short period of time following the Lehman bankruptcy, together with the reduction in reserve requirements, the elimination of a temporary capital control (the unremunerated reserve requirement on foreign loans), and other supportive measures, monetary policy was able to provide a much needed stimulus at the right moment. Fiscal policy on its own also adopted a prudential countercyclical stance by avoiding expenditure cuts despite falling cyclical revenues and by shifting expenditures toward infrastructure investment in order to maximize their impact on domestic demand. Foreign investors can be assured that in case of necessity, monetary and fiscal policy will again react in coordination to preserve macroeconomic stability. In this context of a well-managed macroeconomic policy that guarantees economic stability, foreign investors can take advantage of the well-known government commitment to stable regulations regarding FDI, the existence of abundant natural resources such as oil, coal, and other minerals, significant progress in overcoming security challenges, and the well-trained labor force of the country that has given Colombian management a well-deserved reputation abroad.</p><h4>What is your economic outlook for Colombia in 2013 and beyond?</h4><p>For 2013, 3% inflation and economic growth of 4% or higher is expected. The latter would be the result of a moderate but sustained growth of external demand together with relatively stable commodity prices and conditions of ample liquidity at the international level. At a domestic level, the monetary policy stance, the stability of employment, and the favorable confidence level of households will support the dynamism of household consumption. It is expected that investment will be led by public works and the expansion of large projects in the energy sector. Investment will also have the support of the current relatively low level of interest rates. Of course, there is still considerable uncertainty in the world economy. Beyond 2013, we believe that inflation will be around 3%. We also think that Colombia has enormous potential to grow and to achieve medium-term growth that is somewhat higher than 4.5%, the average experienced over the last 10 years. So long as the country continues making progress on a series of structural reforms, we can grow sustainably at an even higher rate in the future.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>AccessBank has become very important in the Azerbaijani banking sector. How did it become so successful over the past decade?</h4><p>The bank has a very clear strategy. From day one, we have been focusing on micro- and small-business financing, and we continue to pursue this mandate and develop in this market niche. Today, we are the number one bank in terms of financing businesses of this size. Meanwhile, we have a strong exposure to medium-sized corporates as well as a fair amount of exposure to the retail market. The main reason for our success is that we have a clear strategic focus, which is to educate our staff at a very high standard. We take on to take on young talent, often directly from university, and educate and train them internally. We have an excellent motivation system, and I firmly believe that the market recognizes AccessBank as an institution with exceptional staff.</p><h4>How strong is AccessBank in the regions?</h4><p>We have a very strong presence in the regions, with a network of 34 branches that is constantly expanding. We will open a further four branches in 1Q2013. Later in 2013 it is the plan to continue opening branches in the regions where we are not yet present. After a recent meeting with the branch managers of the bank, it became obvious that in most of the regions of Azerbaijan we are  the largest bank. This is because we have placed a very clear focus on the agricultural sector, and AccessBank became the first bank in the country to launch a special loan product for clients in this sector. By being the first mover in this market, we have also become number one in terms of financing small-scale farms in the regions.</p><div class="quote">“We have a very strong presence in the regions, with a network of 34 branches that is constantly expanding."</div><h4>In 2008, AccessBank went through a major rebranding. What were the reasons for this change and how has the bank improved since then?</h4><p>The background of the rebranding was that the bank was a part of a network called Access Holding. In 2008, the holding started to brand all seven of these banks. Currently, there are five in Africa, as well as one each in Azerbaijan and Tajikistan. They were given the name AccessBank. At that point in time, it was not connected to a change in business.</p><h4>To what do you attribute the success and growth of the bank in recent years?</h4><p>In 2006, our loan portfolio was $17 million, in 2008 it had reached $119 million, and in 2010 it grew to over $300 million. Today, we are at $500 million. We have witnessed an amazing and impressive growth trend, which is still ongoing because there is strong demand in the country. This progress speaks in favor of the staff at the bank. If this landmark growth has been achieved at a consistently very low portfolio risk rate, it means that overdue loans have been, at a maximum, just 1% of the loan portfolio. This is an extraordinary figure for this market, which sees an average overdue loans figure of around 5% or 6%. We even had excellent portfolio quality during the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, when there were problems in the banking market. If you ask why this is an example of portfolio quality, it is because we have the right technology to analyze risk. AccessBank has a lot of experience in this area. We have efficient systems to maintain the good portfolio quality.</p><h4>AccessBank has launched many humanitarian initiatives to eliminate poverty in Azerbaijan. What are you doing specifically?</h4><p>We are engaged in a plethora of social initiatives. We have a partnership with the Association of Football Federations of Azerbaijan (AFFA), and we regularly sponsor tournaments for school children, both boys and girls, and a number of summer camps. The program is organized by our employees and bankers, who understand that being part of the local community contributes to local development. The bank also has a history of sponsoring sporting facilities at schools so that children are educated in sports and physical education. Furthermore, AccessBank held an event in collaboration with the artists of the Philharmonic Orchestra here in Baku. We brought children from an orphanage to meet celebrities that are participating in a program to support the development of the children as they continue to grow. In addition to this, there are a number of ongoing social initiatives that the bank is involved in.</p><h4>What are your views of the current state of the banking sector in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>The banking sector is currently developing very dynamically. Many banks have experienced impressive growth rates. This was true in 2011 and continues to be the case in 2012. The penetration rate in the country in terms of financial services is clearly increasing and leading to this development. Still, the average penetration figures for financial services are below not only Western European standards, but also in comparison to neighboring former Soviet countries. In that regard, we still expect growth to continue with immense dynamism.</p><h4>What effect do you expect the new capital regulations will have on your bank when they come into force in 2014?</h4><p>We are already seeing the effects of this new requirement. It has definitely motivated local banks to achieve strong growth in order catch up with their balance sheets and improve toward the level they need to be at in order to be among those fulfilling the threshold in 2014.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the economy in 2013?</h4><p>If we look at the prognosis for the price of energy over the next years, Azerbaijan is well placed. The country still enjoys huge oil reserves, and the gas fields are being prepared for production in a couple of years. With this background, we can expect a very bright future in Azerbaijan. Furthermore, the agricultural sector is well placed for growth.</p><h4>What are the medium-term goals for AccessBank?</h4><p>AccessBank will pursue its mandate to provide financing to the micro- and small-business sector in this country. This is a role we will play in the local market, and we strive to continue developing dynamically to develop with our clients.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Mahan Air is the first private airline in Iran. How would you appraise the Iranian aviation environment?</h4><p>Iran is an enormous country in size. Its land area is larger than France, Germany, Italy, the UK, Austria, Denmark, Belgium, and Switzerland combined. The country has a young population and large expatriate communities settled in Europe, North America, and Australia. Domestic passenger traffic has increased by an average of 7% over the last 10 years, and at the same time international air travel in Iran has grown by a robust 9% per year, which is far above the world average. We are optimistic that this growth trend will continue for at least the next few years.</p><h4>In 2011, 27 million travelers and businessmen passed customs. What can Mahan Air offer to the increasing number of business travelers with respect to service and quality?</h4><p>Iran is indeed a very competitive market, and many of the 37 international airlines serving Iran are among the top-ranking carriers in the world. Mahan Air tends to concentrate on quality more than price, and this strategy has been successful as our market share has increased over the years. We welcome each new international airline that will push us even harder to be competitive. We have a couple of domestic competitors as well as a few formidable ones in international markets, and we have to expand our loyalty base to stay competitive.</p><div class="quote">“We welcome each new international airline that will push us even harder to be competitive."</div><h4>What are the highlights of your airline's evolution, and how do you shape your competitive strategy vis-í -vis your main competitor?</h4><p>We were established in 1991 as the first private airline in Iran and our real growth and gaining competitive edge became possible after the acquisition of our first wide-bodied Airbus in 1998. We do believe that investing in the development of our staff to provide good services before, during, and after the flight will lead to positive feedback for us through word of mouth and generate more customer loyalty, which is a great advantage over all of our competitors.</p><h4>Mahan Air has 28 destinations in 12 countries. Where do you see the highest demand?</h4><p>In the domestic market, the demand between Tehran and Mashhad is the highest, with over 700,000 passengers carried annually. We also carried more than 330,000 passengers between Tehran and Dubai in 2012, making it the most popular international destination for us. As for growth potential, Turkey has shown strong performance with a 20% increase in traffic figures over the last few years, and we intend to focus on this important market in the near future.</p><h4>In mid-August 2012, Mahan Air launched a new international route to Kuala Lumpur. What does this new route mean in terms of the business flow between the Iran and Malaysia?</h4><p>There is a good relationship between these two Muslim countries. I believe that we will see huge traffic flows between Iran and Malaysia. We need at least two daily flights to Kuala Lumpur because there is huge potential on this route and our aircraft are already booked. The market is thirsty for new destinations, especially in the Far East.</p><h4>How is Mahan Air matching quality service with international safety standards?</h4><p>In close to 20 years of operations, Mahan Air has been successful in carrying close to 29 million passengers without a single fatality or injury. This is the result of our relentless safety efforts and our “safety first" policy within the entire organization. I believe that in the competitive environment of the airline industry, the development and implementation of quality services that corresponds with safety does hinder an airline's success; this is one of the challenges that we are facing on a daily basis. However, Mahan Air has been successful in this objective. This is evident in our achievement in reducing delays over the last five years. An internal audit as well as independent audits also show that our level of safety has improved substantially over the same period.</p><h4>What is your economic forecast for the medium term?</h4><p>In a balanced field and more usual circumstances, the level of economic performance depends on global economic trends. However, in Iran—a country famous for its independence from the global economy—the exchange rate and fiscal policies of oil as well as inflation will determine economic growth. We hope to see a breakthrough in Iran's relationships with the EU and others, which will result in the decreasing or lifting of sanctions. In macro-economic terms, although the reduction of energy subsidies has caused high inflation in the short term, I believe the efficiency gains will be positive in the medium term, leading to more growth.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[luxury-first]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of Sinteks MMC in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>In 1992 I started a business as an entrepreneur, and by 1996 it had evolved to become Sinteks, a company involved in luxury brands. We had one multi-brand store before we started to represent well-known Western fashion brands through our mono-brand stores. Currently, we have 35 stores in Baku, and since 2008 we have started to move into more mid-market brands. However, our core and main business strategy relies on luxury brands. At the same time, the company has tuned and evolved the luxury brand concept into two larger multi-brand stores called Emporium, one of which is more classic and chic, with renowned brands such as Giorgio Armani and Stella McCarthy. The other is fresh and young, with many young designers from the US, China, Japan, and South Korea.</p><h4>What are the key factors that have made the luxury sector so resilient in the wake of the recent economic crisis?</h4><p>The most recent crisis started in the US in 2008 and spread out to Europe, Russia, and this part of the world. In general, our economy wasn't too affected by the crisis and is not directly influenced by what is happening in Europe now. I have heard from our partner in Europe that the luxury market there is not flourishing, and there is in fact stagnation there. In Asia and this part of the world, we do not feel this stagnation. Of course, there were some effects, but overall our experience was not as harsh as that of our colleagues in Europe or Russia. In Azerbaijan, we felt a drop in business of about 10% depending on the brand, though some brands did not see any declines. Since 2011, we have registered stable growth in the luxury retail market in Azerbaijan.</p><h4>How do you motivate Azerbaijani clients to buy in Baku in the face of fierce competition from Western European “shopping haven" cities such as London, Paris, or Milan?</h4><p>As a luxury company, we face this type of competition. We aim to demonstrate the difference to our clients. When they travel abroad, they are offered a wider variety than what is available here in Baku. Despite this, we are trying to reach the same level and overcome the competition of shops in Europe and even Istanbul. What we strive to offer here in Baku is a personalized VIP service. At our company we have a special customer service-training program that was established by French and US companies. We implemented this at our store and we are working closely with our customers. We know them directly; this is a small country. Clients are very loyal in Baku, showing that the atmosphere is not like London or Milan, where there are streams of tourists. We are able to offer a precise service to our customers, especially in the luxury segment. This is what we have been doing, and it works. Sometimes it is not only what you buy that matters, but also how you buy it. This is how we struggle against our main competitors; we try to differentiate ourselves to provide the best services adapted to local tastes and specific markets.</p><div class="quote">“We are able to offer a precise service to our customers, especially in the luxury segment."</div><h4>Which luxury segments are you looking into for further investment?</h4><p>We are currently not involved with any jewelry brands and we only have one department in our store dedicated to that segment, though we may focus on it in the near future. Our company does not only work in Azerbaijan, but it is also in Georgia, Kazakhstan, and Mongolia. We are planning to increase our business in those countries as well. We are not considering the restaurant or hotel business, however; we want the company to be a specialist in its field. I am a retailer who has been involved with the business for 20 years, and I also seek to be a professional. Nowadays, with globalization throughout the world, it is important to be truly specialized and a professional in your field, on both a local and international scale. That is why we decided to work overseas and bring our activity to neighboring countries. We conducted research into the gourmet food sector, but we have not yet decided to enter the business. We believe that local tastes are an important and essential part of entering a market, and we will continue to value our research process. We have a client base that we are confidently poised to grow with. However, we have not taken any concrete steps to enter new markets at this point.</p><h4>How have you seen the luxury segment grow and evolve during the past decade?</h4><p>When this company began, it was at the exact same time that “the contract of the century" was signed by President Haydar Aliyev. At that time, as a young entrepreneur, I saw light at the end of the tunnel. I understood the direction that I could go in for my business activity. My company experienced rapid growth, starting from one small store and growing even during the economic crises. One of the main inputs for us is sourced from the government. The Ilham Aliyev administration and model helped us immensely, and now we are reaching our benchmarks. We have seen how a small country like Azerbaijan can play an important role in the worldwide economy. Some of the main factors behind the development of our country include the efficient and visionary outlook of the President, as well as a very healthy economy.</p><h4>What are your development plans and targets for the business over the medium term?</h4><p>We have several projects we are looking at. We are always looking to bring in more major brands. I believe that in 2013 almost all of the major famous brands will exist in this market. We are now seeking more special concepts for Baku, such as a department store and multi-brand store, similar to the “Emporium" concept we have now. In Azerbaijan, the tourist stream is in Baku. We see that the majority of department stores are in London or Paris, where there are many tourists. Geographically, we need space as a retail company that specializes in luxury items. We started our activities abroad in Georgia in 2009, and then we expanded to Mongolia and Kazakhstan. The Georgian market is not as strong in terms of luxury brands, but the Mongolian market was surprising for us. Recently, we launched a Burberry store in Kazakhstan in a brand new luxury shopping center alongside all of the major brands. Previously there had been no shopping destination where you could find all the major luxury brands under one roof, but this project brought them together. Our business in Kazakhstan has been successful and we plan to develop it further. Sinteks also plans to target other Central Asian countries such as Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. It is important to know the market in depth in each country, and we are trying to be more international.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How can French investors take better advantage of the Dominican Republic's geostrategic positioning and its trade agreements with the US, Europe, Caribbean Community (CARICOM), and Central America?</h4><p>The economic relationship between France and the Dominican Republic, the second largest economy in the Caribbean after Puerto Rico, has undergone remarkable development since 2000. Initial investments made by a number of major French groups such as Orange, Carrefour, and Conforama have added several major projects such as the Metro in Santo Domingo and water sanitation, which is being carried out by French enterprises the funding of which is provided in part by the French Development Agency (AFD). To go further together, which will result in an increase in the volume of business and the quality of the political dialogue between our two countries, we agree upon three objectives: first, to facilitate achieving major projects in development realized by the French groups, including Alstom, Thales, and VINCI; second, to extend the feasibility studies during the actual launch of their corresponding sites, particularly in the field of renewable energy (wind energy farms) or railway transportation (the link between Santo Domingo and Santiago); and third, to reinforce the exchange of business between France and the Dominican Republic through the Movement of the Enterprises of France (MEDEF) and the Chambers of Commerce by attracting the best French companies and their subsidiaries in Martinique, Guadeloupe, or French Guiana.</p><h4>France has shown its commitment to the Dominican Republic's development through cooperation in social, cultural, economic, and technological areas. Why is it important for France to support the Dominican Republic's development?</h4><p>There are multiple reasons. One is the proximity of the Dominican Republic with our Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), and another is its adjoining with Haiti and subsequent support after the earthquake of 2010. The country is also an International Francophile Organization (OIF) affiliate and has an observer headquarter office there, subscribes to the EU/CARIFORUM agreements and has a place in our regional system of military cooperation, a commitment to regional political forums, and a common history with France, which makes it an important partner for us. In many aspects, the Dominican Republic is emerging and France has every wish to accompany and support the path of its development.</p><div class="quote">“In many aspects, the Dominican Republic is emerging and France has every wish to support its development."</div><h4>France offers university scholarships to Dominican students to increase cultural and academic exchange between the two countries. How can the students of both countries benefit from this experience?</h4><p>The formation of the elite is a foremost issue, for France as well as for the Dominican Republic. Hence the decision of the two countries to strengthen their partnership in this area with a high-level university cooperation program, currently under implementation. In addition, we are pursuing a French-Dominican co-financed scholarship for the program “Going to France." Our goal is to significantly increase the number of Dominican students in France and our DFA. According to this plan, the Regional Council of Guadeloupe has also established a scholarship program for pursuing graduate studies in Guadeloupe, where the headquarters of the University of the Antilles and Guiana (UAG) can be found. Symmetrically, French students are encouraged to visit the Dominican Republic, especially for immersion stays and language training.</p><h4>How can France and the Dominican Republic improve their cooperation in the reconstruction and renovation program in Haiti?</h4><p>As you know, the reconstruction of Haiti is primarily based on a multilateral mechanism involving key international donors. The main part of the French contribution passes through this device, which centralizes the aid from the international community. On the bilateral plan, high-level, Franco-Dominican consultations were held in 2009 to review the various components of the relationship between the two countries. The next consultations should be held in 2013. However, since the earthquake, our two embassies in Haiti and the Dominican Republic have reinforced the coordination of their actions on projects in the context of the reconstruction of Haiti. The upcoming opening of the University of Limonade is a good example.</p><h4>Earlier this year, the Regional Council of Guadeloupe signed a cooperation agreement to strengthen the commercial and economic bonds between the Dominican Republic and the Guadeloupe region. What opportunities are expected to arise from this?</h4><p>This agreement aims to strengthen the flow of trade and business opportunities within Guadeloupe. It is necessary to increase the amount of meetings between entrepreneurs and traders. In each economic sector where there is Dominican demand, the agreement is to mobilize the established French companies in Guadeloupe and provide a competitive and quality offer. It is the same in the field of urban development and planning, where the Guadeloupe region has an undeniable know-how that can be used toward the development of an urban community of greater Santo Domingo. However, it is left up to private sector operators to define the terms and areas where joint ventures could be considered.</p><h4>The year 2013 will be the “Year of the Dominican Republic" in Guadeloupe. What is the significance of this recognition?</h4><p>Political cooperation between the two countries has meaning only if it serves the reconciliation of people and culture, the strengthening of solidarity between the people, and the desire to live together in a stable, peaceful, and prosperous area. In this context, 2012 was the “Year of Guadeloupe" in the Dominican Republic, where I conducted several delegations myself while presiding over the Guadeloupe region. After being so well received by our Dominican friends, 2013 should be the “Year of the Dominican Republic" in Guadeloupe. With this series of events to be marked on the calendar, we aim to increase the visibility of our great neighbor in Guadeloupe by projecting the image of its economic and cultural vitality and strengthening the mutual understanding between Guadeloupians and Dominicans.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

He obtained qualification as a doctor from the University of Ibadan, Nigeria, in 1972, and also attended the University of Birmingham, England, where he received a Doctorate in medicine in 1979. He was appointed Professor at the University of Ibadan in 1980 and headed the Department of Clinical Pathology before being elected Provost of the College of Medicine in 1990.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As your second year as Executive Director of UNFPA draws to a close, what initiatives are you most proud of and what are your most immediate priorities for the second term?</h4><p>The first half of my tenure as UNFPA's Executive Director was full of initiatives and activities that further promoted the fund's mandate and mission: to deliver a world where every pregnancy is wanted, every childbirth is safe, and every young person's potential is fulfilled. To further improve the fund's accountability, we have developed a new and highly focused business plan, which aligns our vision with our strategic priorities and leads to more transparency and improves our ability to deliver results. This includes a stronger focus on our work in over 150 country offices around the world. We have strengthened their capacity and presence, particularly in dealing with humanitarian emergencies. In addition, we have developed a new communication strategy to better showcase the work UNFPA is doing in developed and developing countries. UNFPA has also reinforced its position as a global thought leader in terms of reproductive health and population issues, with a specific focus on working with young people, who are energetic partners and the future generation that will lead and change our world. In October 2011, the earth's population reached and surpassed 7 billion. This global milestone represents both a great opportunity and a great challenge. Although people are living longer and healthier lives, and couples worldwide are choosing to have fewer children, huge inequities persist. Nearly all of that growth—97 of every 100 people—is occurring in less developed countries, some of which already struggle to meet their people's needs. Gaps between the rich and poor are growing, and more people than ever are vulnerable to food insecurity, water shortages, and natural or environmental disasters. Meanwhile, many rich and middle-income countries are concerned about low fertility, declining populations, and ageing. Whether we can live together on a healthy planet will depend on the decisions we make now. In a world of 7 billion people and counting, we need to count on each other. As for our upcoming priorities, UNFPA will continue to intensify efforts, focusing on promoting family planning in the context of SRH and reproductive rights, especially looking at the needs of young people and women. In addition to our efforts to protect the rights of girl children and further promote the needs of the elderly and young people.</p><h4>What are the strengths and challenges that differentiate Mozambique within your sub-Saharan operations?</h4><p>Mozambique stands as a success story in Africa. It is one of the fastest-growing economies in Africa, and many new investors are coming to the country to explore opportunities. The country won recognition for maintaining 20 consecutive years of peace after the civil war, and is an emerging democracy with sound political stability. The UN System is also implementing the “Delivering as One" initiative, which UNFPA is part of, in Mozambique. We see a strong donor country presence in the country, which leads to resource mobilization opportunities mainly for reproductive health commodities, adolescents, sexual and reproductive health (SRH), reproductive rights, and activities related to census. But there are also challenges. Although the economy is growing, Mozambique still depends on aid from other countries, especially in the social sector. There are also notable social and regional disparities. Mozambique shares many of the challenges that other countries in sub-Saharan Africa face: high levels of maternal mortality and a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS, a low coverage of medical doctors, few skilled birth attendants, and weak infrastructure and transportation. In addition, medical doctors, experienced nurses, and health managers are leaving the public sector to join NGOs and private enterprises. Mozambique's young population offers immense opportunities, but also calls for increased investment to ensure that education, health, and employment reach these young people, and in particular girls, who are often the most vulnerable. UNFPA supports country operations and programs as well as regional policy frameworks, which are aimed at garnering mutual support and commitment to address these critical issues. Mozambique has a number of trade corridors from neighboring countries to its ports and from its growing inland extract industries. This poses additional challenges to the healthcare system and vulnerabilities for its population. UNFPA is working with government and civil society organizations to prioritize interventions for the most vulnerable and at-risk population in these areas. UNFPA, as part of the UN in Mozambique, works with the government on strategies that could lead to inclusive growth and encourage the private sector to strengthen social services.</p><h4>How do you assess the success of UNFPAs seventh program of assistance to Mozambique, and what initiatives define the current phase of interaction?</h4><p>Through its seventh Country Program 2007-2011, UNFPA supported the population and housing census in 2007 and helped improve the availability of population data for planning at the national and provincial levels. Also, we contributed to strengthen policies to improve quality and access to SRH. These efforts are also in line with the national integrated plan to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the national strategy for family planning. In the area of reproductive health, our support was critical to increase the amount of deliveries attended by skilled health personnel, the coverage of institutional births, and the use of modern contraceptives, from 11% in 2007 to 23% at the end of 2010. Another important part was support for the training of health personnel to improve basic and emergency obstetric care and community involvement in the construction and rehabilitation of maternity waiting homes. In the field of HIV prevention and adolescent SRH, UNFPA's support has been key. The cross-sector youth program Geraçío Biz, established with UNFPA's support and with funds from Norway, Denmark, and Sweden, is recognized as a best-practice example in the region. During the seventh country program, the number of community peer educators grew significantly, the number of health providers trained to deliver youth-friendly services tripled, and 1.4 million students were reached through school outreach activities. UNFPA has supported the government and civil society to draft a law against domestic violence, which was approved and is now being implemented. As for the current phase, for the first time in Mozambique, 21 UN organizations developed one action plan to jointly contribute to a set of common outcomes, replacing individual organization action plans and staying in line with the national development plans. Within this program, UNFPA focuses on maternal health and adolescent SRH and has an integrated approach to ensure the complementarity and effectiveness of support to policy development, demand creation, and service delivery at a national level and selected provinces. We continue to work in the areas of gender disaggregated data collection and analysis. The London Summit on family planning also provided an opportunity to put the topic at the top of the political agenda. Clearly, voluntary family planning is a priority for Mozambique, a country with a population estimated to double in the next 27 years. Investments in scaling up family planning are not only a responsibility in terms of rights of individuals and couples to choose the number and spacing of children and to ensure that every pregnancy is wanted and safe, but also in terms of direct development and economic benefits.</p><div class="quote">“Mozambique stands as a success story in Africa."</div><h4>How do you rate Mozambique in terms of gender equality and the implementation of gender-sensitive legislation?</h4><p>Mozambique is committed to gender equality and gender-sensitive legislation is in place, which is an important first step. The country has made significant progress in the areas of gender equality and women's empowerment. Some examples are: the government's creation of the Ministry of Women and Social Action, which set up the National Commission for Women's Advancement (with provincial and district ramifications) and gender focal points in all ministries. There are also gender focal points in non-governmental organizations, churches, and private enterprises. Key ministries, such as Education, Health, Agriculture, Energy, and Public Service also have a gender strategy in place. I commend Mozambique for ratifying several legal instruments, such as the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) in 1993 and the Beijing Platform for Action in 1995. The country signed on to the Millennium Development Goals and the Plan of Action for Poverty Reduction in 2000 and the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Protocol on Gender and Development in 2010. Apart from these international agreements, Mozambique's constitution refers to gender equality as a must. The country has a gender policy and an implementation strategy. In 2004, Mozambique approved the Family Law and in 2009 approved the Law on Domestic Violence Against Women. The government and civil society are working together to promote gender equality. In this process, they have teamed up with the UN system in the country, of which UNFPA is a key player. In the area of gender, UNFPA has specifically provided technical and financial support in the design of the mentioned instruments, and now it is supporting the implementation. UNFPA's strategy has been to strengthen the technical capacity of government and civil society for the implementation of the commitments made at international, regional, and national levels in relation to gender issues. The existence of gender-sensitive political frameworks and policies is boosting progress towards equality. Still, gender disparities persist in some areas, and in particular education, economic opportunities, and health. Gender parity in enrollment at the primary school level has been achieved and at secondary school level improved, but, unfortunately, not all girls complete the full literacy cycle. There is a high rate of child marriage and adolescent pregnancies. As a result, the rate of school dropouts is high. In spite of improvements in the last decade, women's illiteracy in Mozambique continues to be high, and this also impacts access to economic opportunities. Indicators related to women's SRH also confirm the persistence of gender power inequality in the country. Despite a remarkable commitment to reverse the trend, the fertility rate, especially among adolescents, remains high, and gender-based violence continues to be of concern.</p><h4>In what specific ways does the UNFPA support Mozambique's ability to collect and analyze data and develop population projections?</h4><p>UNFPA recognizes that quality and disaggregated data is critical for development planning, monitoring, and accountability. We do share our successful census experience in Mozambique with other countries, such as Angola and Botswana, through South-South cooperation. UNFPA provides technical support to the National Institute of Statistics (INE) and the Centre for Policy Analysis (CAP) at the Eduardo Mondlane University (EMU) to improve their capacity to collect, analyze, and research data. Additional support is given to the National Institute of Statistics to plan and implement the general population and housing census (1997 and 2007); of the $38 million budgeted for the 2007 Population Census, about $26 million was mobilized by UNFPA, representing about 60%. We also organize training courses and develop population projections. UNFPA supports the CAP and EMU in carrying out a Master's program in population studies. Annually, five scholarships are awarded to students to enroll in master degree courses in population and development.</p><h4>What is your vision for the role of civil society in the development of Mozambique and sub-Saharan Africa in general?</h4><p>In Mozambique, civil society organizations became very active after the end of civil war in the early 1990s. At that very beginning, the focus of their work was on reconstruction. Currently, civil society organizations are working in various areas, and are very active in health, human rights promotion and protection, governance, and environment. They do implement activities aligned with the government strategies and the MDGs. Moreover, they monitor the implementation of public policies and development program. By doing so, civil society organizations are playing a great role in the country's development. As in many countries, churches, religious affiliations, and faith-based organizations play an important role in peoples way of living and engagement in development in Mozambique. UNFPA sees civil society organizations as important partners in achieving universal access to SRH. They are critical in the formulation of development policies and programs. Our collaboration with civil society organizations is excellent. As an example, I would like to mention the cooperation with the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) at global, regional, and national levels. We also work with a cross-faith network of religious leaders (COREM). I should also mention the Parliamentarian network as a bridge between civil society and government, which is particularly important when it comes to ensuring that the SRH agenda and legislation are kept high on the political agenda. We have fostered various initiatives, which go beyond government plans, including the participation of civil society organizations and parliamentarian networks: the Campaign for the Accelerated Reduction of Maternal Mortality in Africa (CARMMA) and the Maputo Call of Action and Africa Youth and Adolescent Network on Population and Development (AfriYAN), aimed at supporting countries as they work to achieve the MDGs.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[oilfield-services-in-azerbaijan]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main focuses of Schlumberger's operations in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Our customers in Azerbaijan include the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR), BP, and Total, as well as a number of independent operators that have contracts to rejuvenate existing fields and explore for new reserves. Schlumberger provides technology, information solutions, and integrated project management for its customers to explore, develop, and producer their oil and gas fields. We are providing our services at many of the country's oil and gas fields, including Azer-Chirag-Guneshli (ACG), Shah Deniz, and Umid.</p><h4>What strategy led to Schlumberger's decision to enter the Azerbaijani market?</h4><p>Schlumberger actually first worked in Azerbaijan back in the 1930s. With the signing of the “Contract of Century" it was clear there would be a significant opportunity for the company's technology and expertise to develop the ACG oilfield, and so the company was delighted to restart continuous operations in Baku.</p><h4>How much has Schlumberger invested in operations in the area?</h4><p>The most important investment Schlumberger has made in Azerbaijan has been in hiring and training engineers from Azerbaijan to perform services onshore and offshore. Today, Schlumberger employees from Azerbaijan can be found not only working at Azerbaijani oil and gas fields, but also in major oilfields around the world.</p><div class="quote">“According to industry forecasts, the future for the sector is continued growth."</div><h4>What does Azerbaijan represent in terms of Schlumberger's global operations?</h4><p>Azerbaijan is an important market for Schlumberger. All of the Schlumberger service lines are present in Azerbaijan, and each sees significant potential for further growth. We are particularly proud of the two joint ventures run with SOCAR for drilling fluids (Azeri M-I), and for seismic exploration and processing (Caspian Geophysical).</p><h4>How would you characterize the market for value-added oil and gas services in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>In general we think about the work here in three ways: the mega project, the new discoveries, and the mature oilfields. Each of these categories of oilfields presents specific challenges to the industry. In order to succeed, it is a requirement to bring the right technical solution, be efficient, and most importantly, work safely.</p><h4>What does R&amp;D mean for Schlumberger?</h4><p>An important value of Schlumberger is our steadfast commitment to technology and quality—this is the basis for our competitive advantage. Consistent with this value is our commitment to providing services that enhance and optimize our customers' performance. R&amp;D is essential if we are to meet this commitment. Schlumberger has over 25 R&amp;D facilities worldwide, with emphasis on developing innovative technology that adds value for our customers. In 2011, for example, we invested $1.1 billion in R&amp;D. The reality of bringing hydrocarbons to market today is that the technical challenges are increasing all the time. As it is sometimes said, “the easy oil is gone." That makes it an ever-increasing requirement to apply technology to meet the challenges that today's oilfields present.</p><h4>In terms of the working environment, when you compare Azerbaijan to your previous experience, how do you feel about operating here?</h4><p>I've been fortunate to work in some very interesting places in my career from the Empty Quarter in Saudi Arabia, to the North Sea, to the foothills of the Rocky Mountains in Canada. My latest assignment Azerbaijan is no exception. From a technical perspective, the work can be very challenging with deeply burried, high-pressure reservoirs and challenging formations to drill through. The history of the country, and the oil fields here in particular, also make it a very rich and stimulating environment in which to work.</p><h4>How do you deal with issues of hiring skilled local personnel?</h4><p>Part of our corporate profile is to hire people in every country where we work. We look for people with a good educational backgrounds and then provide them with technical training through our company's training centers to ensure they are competent enough to perform services for our customers. The level of training the company provides is one of the unique benefits of working for Schlumberger. We have four major learning centers in Houston, Paris, Tyumen, and Abu Dhabi. These centers are even equipped with drilling rigs so we can provide our engineers with real hands-on training. Once the employees return from these learning centers they follow a structured program to enable them to continue developing their skills.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the Azerbaijani energy sector?</h4><p>According to industry forecasts, the future for the sector is continued growth. There is ongoing work to maximize production from the existing fields, and there are new discoveries yet to be fully developed. The new subsea developments are particularly exciting and require a new set of technical solutions. The plans to add drilling rig capacity in the country are a good indicator of the confidence we have going forward. We are fully committed to supporting our customers here in Azerbaijan. I am looking forward to continuing to bring innovative technology here to maximize our customers' success.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[generating-business]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main consequences of the 40% energy losses that the country suffers from, and what actions are to be taken now?</h4><p>To reduce energy losses is one of our fundamental objectives for the recovery of the sector. A decade ago, the level of losses was around 46%-48%. In 10 years we have reduced that to 38%-40%. The slow progress can be justified by the inconsistency of the investment. There are points at which progress could be made, but if the investment is stopped then the problem comes back. In the last two or three years, with the help of international organizations like the World Bank and the IDB, we have undertaken major projects that have resulted in significant loss reductions. The result of these projects may be seen in 1Q2013, and the impact on losses will be considerable.</p><h4>At what level are the inconsistent investments hurting the sector?</h4><p>Energy losses mean that for every 100 kW you put on network, 60 kW will reach its destination and 40 kW is lost; you do not know who to charge for this. To remove vulnerabilities in the network, we need to redesign them in a way that people cannot connect illegally. Therefore, the investment needed to improve the network entails an expense. If you spend a year investing and then three years without investing, then you make no progress. The inconsistency of investment in the network is what has allowed the losses to remain high. We must change the transformers and invest in meters, both in smart meters and in prepayments. As we improve all that, we can reduce the losses.</p><div class="quote">“We have major hydroelectric projects under development, and we consider it an important factor in reducing costs."</div><h4>How important is the change to the energy matrix for the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>The generation costs are quite high, and this is one of the main obstacles for the solution of the problem. Approximately 45%-50% of our plants use fossil fuel generation. The current oil price makes generation costs too high for us, so in the future our focus is primarily to change the facilities and direct them to gas and coal. We will try to move to the greatest extent away from energy derived from oil.</p><h4>What is the main reason for the need to review the contracts with power generators?</h4><p>The contracts were designed in times when the price of fuel was very low, meaning the existing indexation formulas that have internal contracts are a distortion of the current price level. The formula allows for fuel indexing, and a marginalization of those who are on contracts. These are the weaknesses of the contracts and they should be adjusted.</p><h4>Could this situation change the attractiveness of the country for investors?</h4><p>We have a record number of generators, and we are in good financial health. However, it is the companies that experience high profits. The formulas were designed with oil prices of $17, and now it is $100, so the distortion is greatly exaggerated.</p><h4>What is CDEEE's estimate of the investment needed in power generation for the country?</h4><p>Right now, we are proposing an open tender for a 900 MW coal-fired plant, and a gas-fired plant of 600 MW. This is an investment that can easily reach $3 billion. We will gradually introduce a 600 MW coal-fired plant, representing an investment of $1 billion-$1.2 billion.</p><h4>What will be the model of contract for this project?</h4><p>The idea is to make a project “turnkey," meaning the government tenders the project and whoever wins will manage the funding, implementation, and additional facilities, such as constructing transmission lines, adapting the port, and installing coal storage facilities.</p><h4>In what projects will the government fund in the power sector?</h4><p>Right now, there are loans that are being used to rehabilitate the networks that were granted by the IDB and World Bank. The government has no perspective on borrowing for investment in the sector. However, there is the need to make an investment in generation before the end of 2012. That is an internal operation where the energy sector and local banks will work together in order to make a substantial investment before the end of the year.</p><h4>How much money is owed regarding the generators?</h4><p>At this time, the overdue debt with generators—more than 60 days—is around $540 million.</p><h4>Do you think it will be necessary to adjust the tariff as suggested by some international organizations in the country?</h4><p>To the extent we are able to reduce the cost of electricity, we will do our best. While it is true that in our rate is higher than in some countries, it occupies a significant proportion of household budgets. The need to lower the cost of generation will also impact the control of user costs.</p><h4>How would you describe the evolution of the sector since the signing of the Madrid Agreement in 2002?</h4><p>The contract extension has greatly limited the ability of the government to find a solution to the problem. The contracts expire in 2016, and our efforts are focused on creating an “energy park" with our own plants to be in good position to negotiate.</p><h4>What investments are being made to exploit the hydroelectric potential of the country?</h4><p>We have major hydroelectric projects under development, and we consider it an important factor in reducing costs, so we attach great importance to them. The current administration has made significant progress in the recovery of dams that were practically disabled. One of those units had gone eight years without operating, and these are the dams that will be rehabilitated. At this rate, the dams will provide an important contribution to our recovery.</p><h4>What are the prospects for 2013?</h4><p>We inherited a large domestic debt and a budget of $270 million. That assignment fell far short of the actual deficit in the sector. In 2013, there will be a bigger budget to cover the deficit, and that will help us to focus on solving the problem. The close of 2012 is going to be traditional; there will be nothing new. There are expectations of a substantial improvement in 2013, in compliance with the commitments we have with generators as well as with suppliers. We will be fully focused on activities solving the energy problem in the medium to long term.</p><h4>Do these plans include the intentions of President Danilo Medina to end the blackouts by 2015?</h4><p>Of course. There is the need for a comprehensive solution, and we are mainly looking to integrate all sectors into a common work plan, covering not only the contracts, but the expansion of power generation, improved management by the distributors, loss recovery, use of hydroelectric generation, contract review, and all such joint activities. By the end of the government's term, each one of these things will have an impact and provide substantial improvement regarding the power issue.</p><h4>Currently 13% of customers account for 80% of collections. What improvements will the Prisma project in energy billing bring?</h4><p>At the moment, 300,000 customers are consuming 80% of the energy bill. The idea is to provide a smart meter to those customers. This Prisma project began in 2009 with EDE Este. Approximately 50% of customers are smart metered, and the idea is to get 100% using smart meters. This will be conducted as a public investment, with support from international organizations.</p><h4>What is the attractiveness of the energy sector of the Dominican Republic for investors?</h4><p>Right now, the country is experiencing steady growth, and energy demand is increasing as well. We need to extend the “energy park" to no less than 1,500 MW in the coming years. That is without counting the large number of self-generators, which are companies that produce their own energy. This is a more stable and cheaper platform, and can be a very attractive investment for any investor interested in the energy sector.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Allianz operates in over 70 countries worldwide. What does Colombia represent to the company's overall business activity?</h4><p>We first arrived in Colombia in 1999 through a takeover, and over a period of two years we completed the acquisition process. We decided to enter the Colombian market because we saw it as strategic for the entire region, which today shows the strongest and most sustained growth in the world. Overall, I would say that Colombia, along with Brazil, is one of the two main markets for our company in Latin America. For example, in Colombia we will close 2012 with over 20% growth if analyzed in terms of the three or four main segments in which we operate: 40% in motor, over 30% in life, and 15% in health. Our predictions show that the sector will continue to grow at a fast pace over the next five years. In addition, we can talk about a general phenomenon in the entire region, which is particularly affecting Colombia; the low penetration rate of insurance products. In Colombia, the insurance penetration rate is around 1.8% of GDP, and this figure is very low when compared to other countries in the region. For example, in Chile the figure reaches 4% of GDP. I believe this situation perfectly explains why today the region and Colombia are rapidly developing. Overall, we have to keep in mind that Colombia is among the top-three economies in the region, enjoys a very stable political and legal framework for investors—one of the highest in Latin America—and has a large population in constant demographic expansion. Colombia has changed over the last decade and Allianz sees this country as a leading economic power in the region. Also, there are plenty of opportunities for a worldwide company like ours, whose financial strength and products are highly recognized internationally. It is a win-win situation for both parties, for we contribute to further generate value-added to each party.</p><h4>What was the business strategy behind the rebranding exercise of Colseguros, a company that today operates under the Allianz name?</h4><p>Allianz is a company highly committed to respecting the local markets where it operates or plans to enter. In this regard, we took our time to understand the cultural heritage and working culture of Colseguros as part of our process of better understanding the markets in which we operate. Such a move was highly appreciated by the Colombian market, and along with our strong commitment to the development of the country, put us in a favorable position. It took us around 12 years to complete the process, and that speaks out on its own about our intentions in Colombia.</p><div class="quote">“Allianz is a company highly committed to respecting the local markets where it operates or plans to enter."</div><h4>How has the company's product portfolio evolved over the last five years, and what kind of products has Allianz brought into the Colombian market?</h4><p>It is hard to trace an evolution of our product portfolio, because we have to keep in mind that the levels of product innovation in our industry are limited. Overall, I can tell you that we differentiate ourselves from our competitors by our attitude. We believe that the market can expand because there is an insurance culture in Colombia that differs from what most of the people think and it is just a matter of making the products accessible to consumers and creating effective distribution, which is what we are focusing on. Therefore, I can tell you that Allianz is bringing high levels of innovation in distribution and technology in order to make products more accessible.</p><h4>In your opinion, why does Colombia not enjoy a higher penetration rate for insurance products?</h4><p>We are convinced that it is all because of the lack of access to insurance information and insurance products, because there is an insurance culture in this country. For example, compulsory health insurance covers around 98% of the population. We just need to find alternative channels to boost accessibility, which Allianz has succeeded in thanks to its commitment to innovate in the distribution area. The industry is constantly growing, regardless of economic downturns, and I expect that the insurance sector will finish 2012 with a growth rate of 15%. We have to keep in mind that Colombia is a very dynamic economy in which the middle class sector is growing very fast. That factor is driving the growth of industries like ours.</p><h4>What are the challenges the sector faces to keep up such impressive growth figures?</h4><p>Up until now, the sector strongly focused on certain areas, and therefore today segments like infrastructure and large corporate risks are extremely competitive and growth opportunities are very limited. The challenge is to exploit other potential segments such as individual insurance and mass markets and do it in a sustainable way. Allianz is focusing on growing in these segments, through technology and distribution. It is all about making future growth potential a reality.</p><h4>Allianz owns a 7% market share. What are your future targets?</h4><p>As a company, we are not involved in all insurance segments, and we do not have future plans to enter into them. Today, our strongest points are vehicle and health insurance, and life where we own over 16%, 20%, and 10% of the market, respectively. However, we have to keep in mind that the latter figure, the one from the health insurance segment, has to be understood in a context where pre-paid medicines also play a role. However, in terms of premiums I would tell you that around 70% of the company's activities are in the first three segments I mentioned: life, health, and auto.</p><h4>What are the company's short-term investment plans?</h4><p>We are developing a business strategy focused on organic and sustainable growth, and if there are opportunities to unite strategies with other companies we will consider them too. In terms of investment, we have invested strongly in technology, for example, in the decentralization of the distribution of insurance products and the digitalization of policy issuance, among other things. I believe that through these kinds of strategies, we can reduce costs and therefore become more competitive at all levels. That is what makes us stand apart from our competitors and, as I said, we will close 2012 with an overall 20% growth—40% if we only consider the main strategic segments for the company.</p><h4>How many clients does the company currently have?</h4><p>In terms of insurance policyholders, we have over 400,000 clients. However, we reach a far larger number as proved by the 1.2 million insurance policies that we currently have. In this regard, I would like to add that the company has over 1,100 employees.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[prospects-abound]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What strengths and prospects has OIETAI brought to the foreign investment climate of Iran?</h4><p>Iran's economy has considerable innate advantages. There are high capacities in hydrocarbon resources such as oil, gas, and petrochemicals, substantial mining potential, and different climatic conditions, which results in a variety of agricultural outputs. In addition, sufficient economic infrastructure to establish industries, well-trained and expert human resources, and access to free water have led to the emergence of investment growth by non-governmental economic actors in the national economy. In the field of economic operations, and regarding the revision of Article 44 of the Constitution, the private and cooperative sectors have become the main actors in Iran's economy, and they are well prepared to become the desirable partners of foreign strategic investors. Iran's capital markets also attract investors in terms of commercial operations. The performance indices of Iran's capital markets have been witnessing considerable growth, which provides for profitable investment in this sector. In the field of new policies for the attraction of foreign investors and according to the law, we have provided new incentives. For example, extending financial prizes in the form of grants to foreign investment companies and advisory companies plays a significant role in attracting FDI. In addition to incentives listed in the Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Act (FIPPA) as well as its implementing regulations, the preparation and finalization of bilateral and/or multilateral foreign investment promotion and protection agreements with other countries should create a confident atmosphere for foreign investors.</p><h4>What is OIETAI doing to facilitate business for foreign investors and linking them to local partners?</h4><p>One of the considerable measures taken to link potential foreign investors to their local partners is to facilitate procedures and administrative support for issuing the necessary permits for the economic activities of foreign investors in Iran. Currently, Foreign Investment Service Centers have been formed in all provinces and are chaired by governors. These centers supervise and assist all activities and requirements related to the business of a foreign investor. This is an opportunity for each province to handle requests in a “one-stop shop" format. In order to expedite this measure, we are aiming to provide a single-window investment system through networks connected nationwide in 2013 that can make this process faster and more transparent. The implementation of these measures will lead to a reduction in the time and fees borne by foreign investors. Moreover, improving the Iran Investment Opportunity (IIO) website has led to a virtual connection network between foreign and local investors. The introduction of more than 1,000 investment projects through this website has provided the easiest and most appropriate channel for dialogue and cooperation between national and international enterprises. In addition to this virtual network, OIETAI has provided an opportunity for direct negotiations between local investors and their potential foreign partners through convening national, regional, and international seminars. This measure has improved negotiation abilities as well as the economic bargaining power of the two parties. It also fosters trust between Iranian investors and their potential partners, and paves the way for bilateral agreements. In other words, we could say that the attraction of foreign investment, with the aim of transferring technology and improving the management of investors, has become part of the behavioral culture of our local partners. There is no limitation with regard to models of cooperation. According to FIPPA, especially Article 3, foreign investors are able to participate in all fields that the local private sector works in. Thus, foreign investors can participant in greenfield projects as well as expansion plans through different schemes of FDI or contractual arrangements, which differ depending on the nature of any given project. According to the law, different schemes such as M&amp;As and NEM are also included. According to Article 214 of Iran's fifth Five-Year Development Plan (FYDP), there is an opportunity for local private sector investors to participate in developmental and infrastructure projects through public-private partnerships (PPPs). Therefore, the presence of foreign investors in these projects will be absolutely reasonable and operational.</p><div class="quote">“The rate of foreign investment growth has been definitively positive for the last five years."</div><h4>In which sector do you see the biggest foreign investor appetite?</h4><p>Naturally, pioneering sectors in every national economy will have the highest attraction for investors. Iran's economy is not an exception to this case. Therefore, the oil, gas, and petrochemical sectors, due to their high contribution to GDP and considerable financial return, are the focal center of interest for foreign investors. In these sectors, in addition to the presence of mega companies, we have to pave the way for the presence of SMEs in downstream industries by adopting an appropriate plan to complement the value chain. I also believe that the other real sectors of Iran's economy have sufficient attraction for foreign investors due to the high flexibility of demand. Among these sectors, industry and mining, agriculture, agro-industry, and tourism have considerable priorities. The numerous advantages of commercial and industrial free zones for economic activities, sufficient potential opportunities in the real sectors of the economy, and special financial services for foreign investors are also provided. However, I believe that, based on the new approaches mentioned in the fifth FYDP, we will witness the powerful and appropriate presence of local and foreign private sector investors in infrastructure—especially in the field of ICT—power plants, transportation, and housing in the near future.</p><h4>What role do you see for foreign investors in the industrialization process?</h4><p>Our goal to attract FDI is not solely limited to the mobilization of funds, because this minimum goal can be achieved through other foreign financing methods. According to Article 2 of FIPPA, attracting foreign investors should follow certain criteria. Improving technology, upgrading the quality of local products, and increasing capital productivity are among our goals. We expect that the linkage between national and international capital can develop the productive capacity of local enterprises, increase employment opportunities, grant access to international markets through exports, and increase the technical and managerial capacity of local enterprises. Based on this approach, we consider foreign investors as the potential partners of local capital in the industrialization process of Iran. Based on the above model, we are working to provide concessionary advantages to those foreign investors who intend to transfer technology and establish R&amp;D units along with their capital transfer to Iran. Thus, according to Article 111 of Iran's fifth FYDP, we are obliged to prepare new arrangements and incentives. We expect that this new strategy will be realized in 2013.</p><h4>Earlier in 2012 you emphasized the realization of a free trade zone (FTZ) in the region that will include Iran's neighbors. How can such FTZs be implemented in the region, and what will be the positive spillovers for the Iranian economy?</h4><p>It is assumed that by using special arrangements for industrial and commercial free zones, we can reduce the decision-making bureaucracy and provide more incentives, which can limit administrative fees and increase capital productivity. The results of an initial study indicate that Iran, Turkey, Iraq, Pakistan, Afghanistan, India, Syria, and a number of other ECO member countries in the region have the potential to establish economic and commercial special zones to improve the flow of commodities and capital. It is crystal clear that economic interests achieved by this bilateral or multilateral measure will benefit all parties.</p><h4>What are the key factors that make Iran so attractive for investors?</h4><p>The rate of foreign investment growth has been definitively positive for the last five years. This growing trend indicates that Iran can be an appropriate host for foreign investment in its economic atmosphere. The provision of suitable economic infrastructure, sustainable access to energy, strong potential economic partners in the market, high demand flexibility, and easy access to international markets have provided unique advantages for foreign investors. In addition to the above-mentioned economic advantages, the legal and regulatory conditions of foreign investor activity have provided a safe and low-risk atmosphere. We offer full coverage of non-commercial risks, a lack of limitation on the ratio of investment, and the acceptance of any contractual arrangements, which have improved the flexibility of negotiations between foreign investors and their local counterparts. Therefore, the easiest measure is to transparently and precisely introduce Iran as home to an economic atmosphere with diverse investment opportunities.</p><h4>Since the government is putting emphasis on investing in the non-oil sectors of the economy, how is OIETAI trying to balance FDI among these sectors?</h4><p>We are working hard to expand the network of the value chain in complementary and midstream industries. Currently, a number of expansion projects in this sector have a high internal rate of return (IRR). The volume of investment required in complementary industries is less than those upstream and it is also more profitable. Thus, this chain should be completed. We have to improve the attractiveness of other sectors by providing appropriate investment opportunities. Suitable financing structures for projects as well as the provision of financial and monetary targeted incentives and advantages can pave the way for the more appropriate participation of foreign investors in other sectors.</p><h4>How are OIETAI and the government planning to diversify the attraction of capital from national and international private finance?</h4><p>The mobilization of financial resources from the international markets is on our permanent agenda. These resources certainly contain various models of participation and lending instruments. There are different modes of financing such as pure finance, structured finance, issuing foreign exchange such as Islamic sukuks, various participation models in the form of FDI, and foreign portfolio investments (FPI), which can be utilized depending on the financial structure of any given project. What should be considered in this process is the liveliness of the local private sector. We also aim to channel existing liquidity in the country and organize more activities in the real sectors of the economy. Capacity building for the local private sector and improving the productivity of investment in Iran are prerequisites for the efficiency of foreign-sourced funds.</p><h4>What do you project for FDI in Iran in the medium term?</h4><p>Our mid-term target as well as the current year's goal is to preserve the country's rankings in the attraction of FDI. We are looking forward to attracting more contributions from international financial resources in our economic sectors. Considering the achievements made during the first six months of the Iranian year, statistics indicate a positive return. According to the existing data, the statistics of foreign investment approvals during the above-mentioned period indicated 80% growth compared to 2011. We are working to preserve and strengthen this growing trend. New approaches mentioned in the country's FYDP imply a promising future in terms of the linkage between national and international capital in our economy. Our goal is to pave the way for this win-win situation.</p><h4>What is your message to the international community and foreign investors?</h4><p>Iran has recently become one of the most influential countries in the international economic arena, and fulfilling our obligations to economic contracts has provided a positive and decisive record on an international scale. The above-mentioned roles and functions, reduction of economic inequality on an international scale, and efforts made to reduce poverty in less-developed countries have strengthened this historical background. Extending grants and developmental aid to these countries, either in the form of direct contracts or through international institutions such as the International Development Association (IDA), the OPEC Fund for International Development, and the Islamic Solidarity Fund for Development (ISFD), have improved the economic rankings of our country in the international economic arena. The high technical and engineering capacities of our country in power plants, dams, irrigation networks, and transportation have led to a flourishing national economy with the participation of the private sector in the international economy. The preservation of capital is an intra-national characteristic and it thrives where there is economic security as well as suitable profitability. I believe that Iran has a unique position to attract these capital resources. Based on the strategy of inviting foreign investors to participate in joint activities at the level of the national or international economy, we can seize this opportunity to introduce ourselves as rational partners for potential foreign investors. The outlook is positive and it provides prospects of a growing future at a regional scale.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>When was Grupo Formula established?</h4><p>We've been around for 80 years, and we were founded in Mexico City. We started with radio stations, which remains our main business to this day. We began with one station back then, and today we have 45 FM and AM stations all over Mexico, as well as stations in the US. We also have a TV channel. Grupo Formula has another company called Mobiliario Urbano (phone booths), which is an outdoor billboard and advertising business. We do this in Mexico City, Cancún, and Acapulco, and will eventually do so in Querétaro. We are aiming for over 2,000 phone booths by next year. We also launched our TV and radio signal in the US, on Comcast and Time Warner on cable, as well as on the Sirius satellite system. We are in the business of marketing. Grupo Formula has grown a lot, especially over the last decade. You have to keep investing and growing in this business, otherwise you're out.</p><h4>How challenging is competition within the industry?</h4><p>In TV, we have only one channel and we don't compete with the likes of Televisa. In radio, on the other hand, we are 100% talk radio, whereas most of the other radio stations are music radio. We have different 24-hour schedules on different stations in which we are unique, so that is tough. I have to determine what programs go where, what themes, and what topics for all those stations. We are our own main competitor. Music radio stations, on the other hand, have to compete with iPods, internet downloads, and CDs, not to mention each other, because there's so many of them. Music radio stations have much more competition than we do.</p><div class="quote">“Our infrastructure is very sophisticated. We can broadcast and sell all over Mexico, as well as in the US."</div><h4>Where do you see the most growth potential?</h4><p>Our listeners are looking for more than just news; they're looking for entertainment. News is pretty much the same morning to night. We want to entertain our listeners with different styles of news and programming. We try to keep it lighter, whether it is politics or finance. Our listeners are generally more educated than music listeners. In the US, we have a potential of up to 30 million listeners; however, it's hard to determine exactly how many people listen into our stations. Also, you have to keep track of young listeners. More and more of them are interested in the news, politics, and global affairs as well as culture, arts, and of course sports. Family issues are also important topics. It is important to keep a balance between all that.</p><h4>Does piracy still pose a bit threat to the industry?</h4><p>Not really; however, there's a problem with pirate radio in the south. In Mexico, there are two types of radio stations: the ones that receive government concessions, which are commercial stations, and the ones that receive permission. With the former, you can sell commercial time. With the latter, you can only broadcast cultural programs, music, and indigenous language teachings, for example. The government gives permits to those stations based on the provison that no commercial activity takes place. However, in the south, those “permitted" stations are sometimes used for commercial activity, so that's where the piracy problem comes in there. Generally, piracy isn't a big problem for us though.</p><h4>How much have you been investing in developing your infrastructure?</h4><p>Our infrastructure is very sophisticated. We can broadcast and sell all over Mexico, as well as in the US. We have 45 different markets, one for each station. In each market, depending on the region or city, those stations can create local programming. For example, the station in Guadalajara or the one in San Antonio, Texas gives local news and focuses on local topics and issues. It's complicated to control and coordinate all those programs from Mexico City. In music, on the other hand, you just have to know what segment of the population you appeal to and play the same music, whether here or in the US.</p><h4>How have you been developing your advertising platforms, and what is your growth strategy?</h4><p>We are still focused on radio for now, but it's growing a lot more on the internet. We have another company, a below the line (BTL) company, which is a form of direct to the customer advertising. We have the opportunity to create intensive special campaigns that are undertaken through various media, including radio, TV, and the internet. These are mostly government campaigns. The BTL business is among the fastest growing markets in the country. We also need to invest in High Definition technology, and grow in terms of our satellite presence, both for radio and TV. We also want to set up more 24-hour stations in the US. To achieve this, we have to position ourselves in the main Spanish-speaking markets like Denver, California, North and South Carolina, Florida, and Texas. The way to grow is by having your own station there; however, it's not cheap. We hope to open a station in Denver soon. We have another station in Los Angeles, and hopefully we'll open another one there in the near future, because California is the main Spanish-speaking market in the US.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

We are targeting growth of 6% per year based on public investment in key infrastructure sectors. Having said that, we also want to register significant GDP growth. Currently, the unemployment rate here is over 75%, and in rural areas it reaches almost 90%. Our key target is to reduce unemployment by at least 15 percentage points through creating jobs in the agriculture sector, re-launching agricultural production, and investing in production and irrigation so that Haiti can become more independent.</p><h4>What is the estimated public investment that you need to reach these goals?</h4><p>The target investment is about $2 billion per year for the next five years. We are currently able to generate $415 million per year, so there is still a gap that we have to compensate for with an increase in state revenues. The government has taken significant measures to tighten border control and fight against tax evasion. Only 3% of Haitians pay taxes, but we are trying to reverse that trend and bring it to at least 15%. At the same time, we are working with international partners to grant Haiti access to the lending market. Currently, Haiti only has access to grants, not loans, because of debt cancellation. We are working with international institutions to take out loans that will allow us to borrow and cover the difference as we invest in the country.</p><div class="quote">“There are several areas where we can improve trade relations with our neighbor, but the relationship we already have is strong."</div><h4>Does Haiti look to the Americas when thinking of partners?</h4><p>Our biggest trading partner is the US, which is the largest market in the world. We are seeking to increase our ties with the US and collaborate to form other legislative and trade benefits. Currently, we have the Haitian Economic Lift Program (HELP) Act, which assists Haitian manufacturing companies as they export to the US. We are also looking at expanding our relationship with the Dominican Republic and, of course, to make Haitian products available in its markets. We want to improve the competitiveness of Haitian products through wider access to our neighboring market, which will be achieved through an agreement with the Dominican Republic. The agriculture sector is currently worth $1.2 billion in trade. Our aim is to sustain that while still investing in the local sector to put our country back on track toward development. We also have strong ties with other countries in the region such as Colombia, Venezuela, and Cuba, with which we intend to build upon different sectors: commerce, agriculture, and social services. We hope to learn from other countries' experiences and introduce some of the same benefits to the Haitian people.</p><h4>What is Haiti's interest in the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America (ALBA)?</h4><p>We're happy with the status we have as an observer. We have a very good relationship with many countries in the region including Venezuela, Ecuador, and Cuba. Haiti is a vulnerable country, so it is in our strategic advantage to maintain good relationships with other countries in the region and maintain our stability.</p><h4>What is your outlook in terms of Haiti's relationship with the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>The Martelly government has an excellent relationship with the Dominican administration. We are working to build on that excellent relationship in order to foster more investment here. Haiti can benefit from the expertise that the Dominican Republic has cultivated by building farms. We have to rebuild the entire country, but we lack sufficient resources and manpower to do it. Haiti looks toward its neighbor to work with us and bring both countries forward. In terms of tourism activities, we are looking at multiple destinations in collaboration with Dominican tourism investors to encourage investment in Haiti. We have had several interested parties already, but we are looking for more. The education sector is another area where we can benefit, as we have 700,000 students studying in Dominican schools. There is also a university here that was built by the Dominican government. We want to have exchange programs with the Dominican Republic to work on human and resource development in our country. Right now, our customs teams are working with the Dominicans to formulate a common approach toward border protection, which can ultimately prevent the illegal smuggling of goods and the trafficking of illicit products. Security is an area that we can work together on. Job creation could also come about as Dominican investors come and establish businesses in Haiti. There are many incentives for Dominican businesses to come here, such as the HELP Act, tourism opportunities, good infrastructure, and possibilities in the areas of construction and development. In these key sectors, the Dominican Republic can play an important role. We are very grateful for the relationship we have formed with the Dominican Republic, and we are going to continue to foster ties bearing in mind the mutual respect of both parties.</p><h4>How do you plan to boost investor confidence in a country that has a strong image of vulnerability?</h4><p>We are working on rule of law initiatives. The rule of law initiatives are taking several steps in order to bolster the rule of law. We want to tighten up mutual investment agreements with partner countries. This includes working on trade agreements with a number of countries, reviewing the investment code, and making it interesting for an investor to enter our market and take risks. We are working with international institutions to boost our investment grade, which is currently DDD. We have also introduced legislation to fast-track the process of establishing a company here. Our goal is to make Haiti a more business-friendly country. Furthermore, we are still considering the joint-venture model with private investors, which would offer great tax benefits because the government becomes a partner in their investment.</p><h4>What environmental agreements are there between the Dominican Republic and Haiti?</h4><p>Haiti has a 98.5% deforestation rate versus the Dominican Republic, which is a very lush country. One of the things that we are working on is a national reforestation policy with the assistance of the Dominican Republic, in which we are striving to exchange skills through technical experience agreements with it. On every front, we have a strategy based on Haitian development, working with—not against—the Dominican government.</p><h4>What more is there to be achieved for Haiti and the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>We want to achieve two main goals: to strengthen our trade relationship and market specific key products. Haiti has excellent coffee and mangoes that we would like to export to the Dominican Republic, and we also want to introduce our indigenous beer, Prestige, to the Dominican market. There are several areas where we can improve trade relations with our neighbor, but the relationship we already have is strong. We anticipate that it will continue to be strong for years to come.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Colombian flowers and coffee are well recognized worldwide. What other main export products and markets are being targeted?</h4><p>The internationalization of Colombian agricultural goods began long ago. The country has signed trade agreements with several countries and blocs: Mercosur (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay), Mexico, the Northern Triangle (El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras), CAN (Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador), Chile, Canada, Cuba, Venezuela, the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), and others. However, the free trade agreement (FTA) with the US, signed in May 2012, is perhaps the most significant commercial step for us. Colombia increased export volumes to the US by more than 20% in the first 11 months of the year from 460,000 tons in 2011 to 553,000 tons in 2012, mainly due to sugar and confectionery exports, (+154%), banana (+17%), and coffee (+30%). The main agricultural trade partners of Colombia are Belgium, the UK, Germany, the US, Brazil, Ecuador, and Venezuela. Traditional products—banana, coffee, flowers, sugar, and snuff—represent on average about 77% of our total exports, and in the last five years we reported an average annual growth of 8%. Henceforth, our future goals are to create the right conditions for the modernization and specialization of agricultural production, strengthen Colombian agricultural institutions, and expand the supply of exportable products for which the country has great potential: beef, fruit, palm oil, cocoa, rubber, forestry products, and biofuels.</p><h4>What are your export expectations for 2013 and beyond?</h4><p>Colombian agricultural and agribusiness exports have been relatively concentrated in supplying the markets of developed economies, notably the US and the EU. In terms of volume these two markets accounted for 60% of our exports between 2006 and 2011. To a lesser extent, exports also went to neighboring Venezuela, Peru, Ecuador, and Chile, with our traditional agricultural goods—coffee, sugar, bananas, and flowers—being the main products. Given the need to expand exports, Colombia has diversified its agricultural production and its trading partners, promoting investments to meet the capitalization requirements and the modernization of production activities through financial instruments, technical assistance, research, and opening international markets via FTA negotiations. Colombia is currently holding talks with South Korea, Panama, Japan, Turkey, and more. The appreciation of the Colombian peso against the US dollar—from 2007 to November 2012 the Colombian peso has appreciated by 280 pesos—significantly affects the export sector, so it is safe to predict export trends for 2013 under these conditions. The current favorable economic situation of Latin America, where the estimated growth forecast is 4% for 2013, means that the export of agricultural goods to neighboring countries is likely to increase in 2013.</p><h4>What is your Ministry's strategy to encourage international investment in the Colombian agricultural sector?</h4><p>We have strengthened investment in the sector through financial resources from the national budget, which allocated 20% more in 2012 as compared to 2010. The country offers great opportunities in agribusiness, such as the availability of land for large projects (cocoa, forestry, and corn), the expansion of promising crops such as palm oil, significant growth in the production and consumption of biofuels, tax benefits and incentives for forest plantations, and improvement of the country's risk ratings. New investment will enable the development of innovation processes and technology transfer, the modernization of the production chain, and the procurement of capital goods, machinery, and equipment imported at lower costs. This will strengthen Colombia's competitive advantages over other countries that have not signed an FTA with the US. However, the country faces key challenges, especially in terms of transport infrastructure such as roads, airports, and ports, as well as innovation and technological development and qualified and skilled human capital. To better position Colombian agricultural products in international markets, it is necessary to improve phytosanitary accreditation systems for products in which the country has comparative advantages, such as fruits and vegetables. The Colombian Altillanura, considered the country's last agricultural frontier, has an area of more than 3.5 million hectares for the development of agricultural projects and activities within the rubber, forestry, sugar cane, palm oil, corn, soybean, sorghum, rice, and sustainable livestock segments. In addition, the country has some 17 million hectares suitable for reforestation, and its expansion is certainly very attractive to foreign investment. Finally, the government has submitted to congress a draft law on foreign investment in the agricultural sector. The project regulates the acquisition of rural land for the development of agricultural production involving foreign investment. It also proposes the creation of the National Registry of Foreign Investment in the agricultural sector that would be under the Ministry of Agriculture.</p><div class="quote">“Colombia is one of the most stable countries in Latin America, and offers a positive economic climate to attract foreign investors."</div><h4>What trends in investment can you identify, and which sectors are the most attractive?</h4><p>Colombia is one of the most stable countries in Latin America, and offers a positive economic climate to attract potential foreign investors to develop the advantages and opportunities offered by the sector. According to the IMF, the Colombian economy will grow by 4.4% in 2013. Total foreign investment increased from $2.47 billion in 2000 to $13.39 billion in 2011, mainly in the mining and energy sectors, and in free zones and hotels. Although the flow of foreign investment in agriculture accounts for only 1% of total FDI, the Colombian agricultural sector offers great investment opportunities. Colombia is one of the countries with the greatest potential for the expansion of agricultural lands in the world. Of the total area suitable for agriculture (21.5 million hectares), only 4.7 million hectares in agriculture and 459,000 hectares in commercial forestry are currently in use. Therefore, we hold huge potential to develop production facilities in crops like cacao, highly recognized for its flavor. Colombia has expanded its cacao acreage by 56% between 2002 and 2011, reaching 145,000 hectares, and we target the establishment of 28,000 new hectares and the renewal of 36,000 more as part of the Decennial Cacao Plan. In cattle, the country ranks fourth in Latin America (29.2 million head in 2012). The formalization of the industrial link (slaughter plants), as well as the improvement of distribution and marketing practices, present opportunities for private investment. In terms of biofuels, the country has been increasing its production capacity in biodiesel and ethanol. Nearly 439,000 tons of domestic crude palm oil production are used for biodiesel, and more than 374,000 tons of raw sugar are used in the production of ethanol. To increase our competitiveness we urgently need to attract further investment to improve local and national road networks, transport capacity in ports and consumer centers, as well as irrigation and drainage infrastructure.</p><h4>What measures are being taken by the government to improve the efficiency of livestock production and the mechanization of agriculture in the country?</h4><p>The government has prepared financial instruments, technical assistance, and risk management tools in an effort to improve agricultural productivity and the competitiveness of small and medium producers. Colombia has a scheme of second-tier banks to ensure credit resources offering favorable financial conditions, with preferential rates for small producers to finance agricultural and agribusiness activities. It also defines special credit lines under specific conditions aimed at a segment of producers or agricultural activities that require special attention. Between 2009 and 2011, financial resources to farmers increased by 32%, reaching $2.7 billion. In 2012, the same figure reached $3.2 billion. External market challenges make risk management a must in the government's agenda. For that reason, Colombia has developed the Agricultural Insurance and Hedging Program. The government supports the purchase of insurance against natural and biological hazards, from 60% to 80% of the value of the policy.</p><h4>What steps are being taken to increase the volume and quality of small producers?</h4><p>The government, through the draft Rural Development Act, is proposing a new regulatory framework that aims to promote programs of rural development, more effective management of territory, and sort and formalize land ownership issues, define protected areas, and resolve conflicts in land use. The proposed regulation aims to strengthen rural human capital, with a focus on early childhood nutrition, offer a universal coverage of education and basic health, as well as universal social security in rural areas. It will increase capital, spread knowledge and productive technology, strengthen partnerships and rural organizations, and improve the basic infrastructure of transportation, water, education, health, and sanitation in rural regions. Also, according to the National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE), 32,000 new or rehabilitated housing units were delivered to low-income farmers in 2012. For 2013, we have an ambitious budget plan to increase the figure to up to 100,000 housing units. Finally, more than 20,000 small producers have benefited from the Productive Partnerships Program that the government launched five years ago, which aims at establishing market links between small producers. Also, we invested some $17 million in the Rural Opportunities Program to support micro entrepreneurs.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Colombia's agriculture sector for 2012 and beyond?</h4><p>The agricultural sector has traditionally been a generator of growth and employment opportunities in the domestic economy, providing more than 3 million jobs in rural areas. We estimate that agricultural GDP will grow about 3% in 2012. We aim at improving and strengthening key crops like coffee. In 2012, we renovated and planted nearly 61,419 hectares of coffee, which represents an increase of 9% compared to 56,316 hectares in 2011. In fact, between 2010 and 2011 we awarded more than $495 million in grants to finance coffee activity, technical assistance, research, and care programs for the rainy season. The expected performance of the agricultural sector will depend on the evolution of internal and external variables such as climate, international prices, exchange rates, and natural disasters.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your main priorities in transforming Mozambique's transport infrastructure?</h4><p>The current transport infrastructure in Mozambique comes from colonial times. The Portuguese and the British colonial administrations used Mozambique as a service economy and gateway to Britain's nearby colonies. Therefore, all the infrastructure was designed with an East-West orientation. That was good, except it didn't do much for the country, which has a predominantly North-South orientation. Throughout the world, in terms of modes of transport and not considering air, sea is the best method, followed by rail, then road. In Mozambique, it was historically the other way around; road first, rail second, and sea third. The whole strategy is to change this setup, especially considering Mozambique is a long and coastal country. Roads will also serve to connect the rail to the sea in an East-West orientation. The presence of mineral resources has helped us shift priorities. Priority number one is to finish the Sena line, which is the shortest distance between the coal mines of central Mozambique and the port of Beira. Priority number two is a new railway, called Macuse, which will come from Moatize to a new port in Zambezia province—the exact location is still being determined. The third priority is for a railway to connect the country to Botswana via Zimbabwe for coal export purposes. Then we have two more lines, one going to Nacala port through Malawi and another one to Nacala that remains in Mozambique. The main ports in our country are Beira, Maputo, Tete, and Nacala. A new North-South line is going to be built in pieces, in order to take advantage of the locations of coal reserves. In five years, I would like to see 3,000 kilometers of railway operating. If we don't have everything running we will lose valuable investments from foreign companies.</p><h4>Where have you targeted the $500 million that you spend annually upgrading Mozambique's transport infrastructure?</h4><p>That $500 million has been spent mainly on two main ports, Maputo and Beira. In Maputo it was for dredging the channel, building new terminals, and expanding the existing ones. In Beira it was also spent on dredging and building coal terminals. One of them is finished, and now we are working on the second one. Some of the $500 million investment also went toward our airports, which are not driven by coal but are driven by tourism. We are revamping most of our airports and modernizing the infrastructure. We finished Vilankulo first, which is a tourist area, and now we are finishing up Maputo. We have also been doing some reconstruction in Beira, Quelimane, Nampula, and Tete. We're going to start work on Nacala Airport, and in 2013 we will start to build two new airports, one in Pemba and one in Tete.</p><div class="quote">“One of the fundamental aspects of regional integration is the movement of goods and people across borders."</div><h4>How are you working with private entities?</h4><p>Most of our projects are carried out in partnership with private entities. They put most of the money in, then operate and manage the projects. This is the case in Quelimane, Beira, and Nacala. We have just finished negotiating with Vale regarding the railway line from Tete to Nacala through Malawi. Negotiations are starting with a Chinese consortium and a Kazakhstani group on further projects. Most projects operate under a public-private partnership (PPP) model, except for the airports, which we borrow for and then construct.</p><h4>To what extent is Mozambique important to the South African Development Community (SADC) in providing transportation and access for its landlocked neighbors?</h4><p>Mozambique is one of the founding members of the SADC, and we have been involved with it for many years. We are also a signatory of the Almaty Declaration, which obliges countries like ours to serve as a gateway for imports and exports to and from landlocked countries. In addition to that, we are discussing a huge agenda in terms of regional economic integration. One of the fundamental aspects of regional integration is the movement of goods and people across borders, and for that this country is of significant importance. The huge infrastructure program for African development has gone way beyond the SADC to East Africa. A railway connecting Cairo to South Africa is also being planned, and Mozambique will also be connected to it.</p><h4>What has been the impact of the Maputo Corridor on the potential for an increasingly favorable investment climate for Mozambique?</h4><p>The Maputo Corridor was one of the first such corridors, and it was developed purely on a PPP basis. We started planning it in 1986, and five years later we had about $2 billion. Now we have about $4 billion or $5 billion including energy, highways, railways, and border crossings. The scoping exercise was done under the SADC context, until we discovered coal. First we thought we had 3 million tons, then realized it was 12 million tons and later revised that to 100 million tons. It is thus a significant corridor.</p><h4>What is the current status of the Northern Development Corridor from Tete to Nacala?</h4><p>Building is underway to rehabilitate this corridor. There is currently a study being conducted by a Japanese group on the old port because it needs to be modified to provide more space for other commodities such as those from the agriculture sector. At the same time, there are studies on the ground to build an airport in Nacala, too. In the near future, Nacala is set to surpass Tete as an air transport hub.</p><h4>The laws to negotiate on behalf of the government for port concessions have recently changed. How will this directly change the way that concessions are made for ports in Mozambique?</h4><p>These are simply new elements in the old way of carrying out concessions. First, we aim to promote social inclusion, and second, the transfer of technology. This is something that has proved challenging in the past, since the logistical operators see the infrastructure as being more efficient if it is dedicated to one commodity. However, they have to accommodate other users. We finished a round of negotiations with Vale, which ended up being a success, and now it is training a large number of people.</p><h4>How are you expecting the value-added of this deal to manifest itself?</h4><p>This is not within the concession contract, as such. It is, instead, a part of government policy as a whole. We do have a vision, but we don't impose it on anyone, although we do encourage it. We have a project to build an iron smelter in Nacala. That will encourage the processing of iron ore and coal as well. We are also putting together a strategy to generate electricity. We envisage incentivizing value-added production. In Phase I we will obtain the raw materials, and then Phase II is the processing phase. The challenge in terms of processing is that you need to have more than one raw material in order to make processing viable. We are not at that stage yet, but will reach it.</p><h4>What levels of investment are you looking at to rehabilitate the airports?</h4><p>We are looking at around $1.5 billion in total. That includes building new airports as well as lengthening runways and modernizing airport terminals. This investment only covers large airports. We have many smaller airstrips throughout the country that are not covered by this plan.</p><h4>In terms of the vision for transport policy, what role will aviation play in the future?</h4><p>Aviation will drive development not just with regard to businesses but people as well, as they need a safe way to travel quickly. It can take up to three hours to fly from the north of the country to the south. Aviation will also promote tourism, as airlines are a marketing medium and connect the whole tourism development chain.</p><h4>With these new airports and increased capacity, what sort of opportunities are there for private investors within the aviation industry?</h4><p>There are opportunities in maintenance, catering, as well as non-aviation services within the airport, such as duty-free shopping. That is how most airports make money. Airlines will also bring in increased revenues. In two years, the number of airlines serving Maputo Airport has increased from two to five. Qatar Airways will start flights from Doha in 2012, and we are also in talks with Lufthansa and Emirates with regard to opening direct flights from Germany and the UAE. Domestic air travel will also soon open up to foreign investment. However, for now, all airlines that want to operate in Mozambique have to be locally registered entities. Soon, Nacala, Pemba, and Tete will also start seeing more direct international services arriving at their airports.</p><h4>What is the current situation regarding the regulation of mobile operators in Mozambique? Is the government doing anything to promote increased entrance to the market in the communications sector?</h4><p>Not exactly. We already have a regulatory body that governs communications. Telecomunicaçíµes de Moçambique (TDM) runs the fixed-line market as well as the three mobile operators. What we are doing now is to put together a commission to look at the implications of communications convergence.</p><h4>What opportunities are there within the telecoms market to invest?</h4><p>It is easy to invest, the problem is the market itself. In terms of mobile communications, the issue is merging licenses. You cannot simply go and ask for separate licenses to operate various communications platforms. We would like to streamline this process in the near future. The only problem is infrastructure-related, depending on frequency and spectrum availability. However this is not our problem, it is related to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) in Geneva. Otherwise, one simply has to apply and if granted a license and a frequency then operations can start.</p><h4>What options are there for increased privatization in the communications sector?</h4><p>The issue of privatization is a question raised, as well as whether it is needed. I don't think privatization is necessary at the present time. What is important is to be able to set up your business. If a company that the government owns is building a fiber-optic cable for high-speed internet, and it is doing well, then why should it be sold? We are not talking about privatizing our public entities. We talk about partnerships and joint ventures. We don't see a reason for privatization as long as we are open for other businesses to enter the market and don't hold a monopoly. Privatization is only a last resort if things are going wrong.</p><h4>Do you think the privatization of Linhas Aéreas de Moçambique (LAM) would encourage increased competition 10 years down the line?</h4><p>It may increase competition, but at this stage of our development, we have to be careful. If LAM was privatized, for example, other private sector airlines may not be able to fly to less-lucrative destinations, meaning underdeveloped parts of the country would not receive services. I would prefer to keep LAM stated-owned, although I wouldn't mind signing a management contract; however, the preference is to keep LAM state-owned and subsidized. Of course, there are other companies that can be privatized. We feel that as long as our market is open to the private sector to come in, it is fine for us.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In 2011 Banco del Progreso saw a 24.1% increase in total assets, a 27.3% increase in its gross loan portfolio, and a 2.3% decrease in the NPL ratio. To what do you attribute these results?</h4><p>These indicators demonstrate the dynamism of Banco del Progreso in 2011, which confirms the trajectory of healthy growth that we have achieved over the past three years. This strong growth has been possible partly in thanks to the commercial policies that have focused on the development of financial products, which is consistent with the situation in the Dominican Republic, as well as the greater involvement of our business in the competitive Dominican financial market. The figures have positioned the bank to continue capturing a large share of the market. Our efforts will continue until we achieve the market position that Banco del Progreso deserves.</p><h4>How has Banco del Progreso's recent acquisition of Banco Capital's assets and liabilities strengthened your position in the country?</h4><p>With this transaction in 2011, Banco del Progreso increased its assets by Ps765 million and its deposits by Ps497 million, solidifying our profitability while at the same time permitting us to lay the foundations for a consolidated leadership that the numbers prove we are capable of. The purchase of Banco Capital not only had a positive impact on our financial indications, but also made an internal impact on the management of our services, which created a corporate unit called “División de Negocios Empresariales." With this unit, we are serving business sectors in the areas of industry, commerce, construction, and transport, among others.</p><div class="quote">“The figures have positioned the bank to continue capturing a large share of the market."</div><h4>Banco del Progreso was ranked as a BBB bank with a positive outlook by Feller Rate. What strategies have defined the bank's risk management?</h4><p>As clearly indicated by Feller Rate in its move to grade Banco del Progreso's investment rate at BBB, this rating reflected our engagement in an internal transformation and competitive repositioning. Feller Rate considers that the basis is robust as it sustains the achievements of the bank, and that they comply with all of the liquidity and solvency requirements that the prudential standards of the regulator require. We are also implementing projects and systems that guarantee the minimizing of risk and maintaining sustainable growth strategies in our business endeavors.</p><h4>What are your plans for continued expansion of the American Express network in the country?</h4><p>First of all, we succeeded in the renewal of our contract with American Express and Lí­nea Centurion for an additional 10 years, being the only business entity in Latin America to achieve exclusivity with the company. In this way, we will be able to continue consolidating the presence of American Express in our markets as an attractive payment medium, mainly due it is flexibility, loyalty system, and points that never expire. In addition to these benefits, we offer a product called the Suma CCN American Express® card, which allows customers to save. It is an innovative card that allows clients to receive savings while shopping in commercial establishments of various types, from supermarkets, bookstores, and home goods stores to gas stations and pharmacies. In just one year, customers who have obtained this card can win savings of up to Ps30 million. Recently, American Express recognized Banco del Progreso for having created this card, which represents an innovative program in terms of marketing and because it has triggered the exceptional performance of local business. A third important aspect in the continued expansion of the American Express brand is the launch of the first American Express debit card, which, like the credit card, will have a Membership Loyalty Rewards program, making this form of payment method available for the first time in the Dominican Republic. With all of these initiatives, American Express is assuming a new position in the local credit card market, something the company has achieved on the basis of the prestige and service quality that it is able to offer.</p><h4>The development of SMEs is at the center of the government's economic strategy. How has Banco del Progreso contributed to national development in this area?</h4><p>We have contributed to the degree that the prudential standards allow us, granting credits to SMEs with competitive rates and individual and personalized consultation services. In partnership with the División de Negocios Empresariales, we also offer support and follow-up services to our clients in this important sector of the economy.</p><h4>What are Banco del Progreso's priorities and its outlook for the medium term?</h4><p>Our priorities are oriented toward the improvement of our internal management, relationship building with our clients, the creation of more innovative products, and the drafting of a general value proposal that permits the bank to continue realizing the aspirations of personal and corporate progress. In this way, we are working together to build an extraordinary future.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does Mexico play in IBM's Growth Market Unit for developing markets?</h4><p>We have 85 years of history in Mexico, and we recently announced a $70 million investment as part of our Road Map 2015, which is very important for IBM. Within that document we present the four main strategies for the corporation. One of them is a Growth Market Unit, which is comprised of about 140 countries with large opportunities for growth. In these areas, the IT penetration rate is usually lower than in major markets. When we started this project, the Growth Market Unit was below 20% of the company's total revenues. The Road Map 2015 outlines the objective to increase that figure to 30%. IBM has selected 20 countries for higher growth and investment, and Mexico is one of those. We are very proud of this fact and are focusing growth more on the business market. The other three focus areas are cloud computing, business analytics and optimization, and Smarter Planet.</p><h4>Within those three business groups, where is the main focus in this market?</h4><p>At IBM, we are applying cloud computing, business analytics, and smart concepts. We have built what we call the transformation of IBM, which incorporates goals to maintain the hardware business while building a strong software and services basis. Currently, hardware makes up only 20%-21% of the total business of IBM. We were able to build 80% of our operations around software and services, and this links to a strategy we have been carrying out recently. We are approaching IT as a supporter of businesses. We are investing heavily in the transformation of our business and are becoming more linked to the idea of technology supporting other enterprises. We combine the industry and our knowledge as part of the strategy, bringing huge amounts of expertise to Mexico. A sub-chapter of business analytics and optimization, which is very popular in Mexico, is what we call “smarter commerce." Smarter commerce is breaking the boundaries between retail, telecommunications, banks, and consumer companies by connecting ecosystems. We are also connecting to the consumer in a smarter way, utilizing social networks to the full potential on the business side. We have many tools and methodologies for smarter commerce, which include taking advantage of social media and software that allows clients to run campaigns on the web and utilize the best marketing strategies of the digital world. We also offer core metrics, which can help our customers measure the success of their campaign on the web.</p><div class="quote">“The university system here is very strong, especially in terms of IT, where graduates are highly qualified and talented."</div><h4>How is the development of technology impacting data centers in Mexico?</h4><p>We are seeing that consumers are maturing and they seek to concentrate on their core business. It is very difficult for many customers to keep up with technology investments, training, and certification. We have offered 60,000 courses in Mexico in the last two years, with 1,000 new technical certifications. For any company with core business separate from the IT side, it is difficult to maintain something like a data center—considering air conditioning, energy, space, security, heat, back-up generators, and diesel. We developed a Smarter Data Center in Mexico with a $30 million investment and we plan to operate four in total by 2015. IBM uses only the latest technology to analyze floor space and energy and heat distribution. Customers can connect through the web to see their equipment, evaluate each piece, and monitor them remotely. The services they can offer are under the umbrella of four categories. One is outsourcing; a second is software production: worldwide, there are 60,000 people working in our software facilities. We are exporting software and services from Guadalajara, which is home to a global delivery center. The third possibility is technology services—specifically traditional varieties such as maintenance and technical support. The fourth one is consultancy.</p><h4>How strong is the local market from a human capital perspective?</h4><p>The university system here is very strong, especially in terms of IT, where graduates are highly qualified and talented. IBM has formed alliances with 80 universities in Mexico, where we share best practices, certification programs, and policy making. Our partner schools maintain the right to use all of our software—there are 1,000 products that professors can use for free to teach students about best practices in the corporate sector. We also employ 350 ambassadors who can teach or link universities mainly in Mexico City, Guadalajara, and Monterrey. It is very important for us to identify top talent from the best universities and provide them with a balanced curriculum.</p><h4>How is demand from the SME segment evolving?</h4><p>IBM has formed partnerships with 100 new SME corporations in the last six months. We are growing with a specific mid-market strategy for SMEs. IBM has assigned 200 new people to carry out such projects in Mexico, and our expansion approach is working well. The new branches constitute a $10 million investment. It's beautiful when you bring value-added technology to smaller corporations or companies, because it sincerely supports their business. This is our specialty.</p><h4>How would you advise clients to implement a successful cloud strategy, and what particular trends can you identify in this market?</h4><p>In Mexico we just announced part of a $70 million investment, and $30 million of it will be allocated to an IBM Smarter Data Center located at our Technology Campus in Guadalajara. The data center is already a base for cloud computing. With the Smarter Data Center, we are aiming to combine the worldwide efforts of IBM in cloud services with a local deployment that includes cloud offerings. Some clouds will be designed for connecting desktops as part of a less-expensive operation with even more control and security, connected to a central cloud that handles everything. This system would not require each PC to be equipped with licenses and software. We can support and concentrate the licenses remotely. Other people are using cloud computing for the maintenance of applications instead of buying the equipment for the software. In addition, the cloud usually has an efficient back-up system in case of disaster, so that all of our clients feel protected with this solid recovery infrastructure. For them to buy this technology themselves would be very difficult, as would be the maintenance process and the hiring of experts. Our cloud helps customers handle a variety of processes and has a myriad of applications.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[double-time]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Bilgi University grown and developed since it was founded?</h4><p>Bilgi was one of the first in the second wave of universities founded in Turkey. Its story goes back a bit further to the time of private universities, because private universities were not allowed to set up. Initially, the school was set up as a private university that was doing dual-degrees with UK universities. It was founded by nine founders who were not entrepreneurs; they were simply in love with education. They wanted to set up a university in Istanbul to introduce a synergy between the poorly served neighborhoods and wealthy students. It serves the A+ to A category in terms of non-scholarship students. Since 2009, we have been a very highly perceived social science university. Because of the competition in mass education, we decided to become a fully comprehensive, national university rather than an Istanbul city university. We added engineering, architecture, health sciences, and many Masters and PhD degrees. For the first time in Turkey, we created a bilateral exchange agreement with the University of Liverpool in the UK. We were the first to do so in a foundation university. And we were the first to do a 3 + 1 degree in Turkey, where you study three years here and spend your final year in the UK, ultimately receiving two accredited degrees. It was a major accomplishment. We have seven such degrees available now, and we want to grow in that area.</p><h4>Bilgi University is spread across three campuses in underprivileged areas of the city. What was the motivation for organizing the university this way?</h4><p>The motivation is very simple. Universities in developing countries need to be part of the process of the equal distribution of income and opportunities. That is how we started in terms of our thinking. Therefore, in order to get these neighborhoods involved, we need to be in them. Many schools are in the better neighborhoods, and they try to visit the less fortunate neighborhoods. We find it better to be physically in the area, so we can best serve the needs of the neighborhood. When I say “we," I refer to both the academic students and the staff who are aware of Turkey's greater problems rather than just the problems on the street. That is why we went in with that concept and it worked. Bilgi was initially criticized regarding security concerns, but it has not had a single major incident. We try to serve not just the student population, but also the entire population of these neighborhoods. We have a law clinic that provides free legal services. We try to provide for local educational needs and even food needs to an extent. It is not endless, but we do what we can. In addition, Bilgi has educational services for youths and young adults. Whether through vocational, language, art, or performing art classes, they have the privilege of paying a low tuition fee to attend if they are able to get into the university through the entrance exam.</p><div class="quote">“Universities in developing countries need to be part of the process of the equal distribution of income and opportunities."</div><h4>What should Turkey do to increase participation in post-secondary education?</h4><p>I think that the Turkish government understands the need to address the youth problem first, and employability second. The government started the demassification process in 2007 when they doubled the size of universities in Turkey. At first it did this through public means, though there is only so much that can be done by raising taxes. The government stopped at 103 universities. Then it began to increase establishment approvals to found new universities—the number went from an initial 23 to 65 universities today, and up to 70 as we speak. There were 173 universities in 2012 compared to 80 in 2007. Of course, there are going to be ups and downs, and problems with the new schools—and even with the old schools—but eventually we will find a way to create opportunities for more university graduates. The third phase is going to be the privatization of education. Private education is coming. There is a debate because the Council of Higher Education (YÖK) has announced that it would like to have international branches, but because of past problems in the Middle East during the economic crisis, they may be allowed to partner up with institutions here. Once that goes through, I think there will be another five-year cycle before the demand and supply problem will be solved.</p><h4>Why are international links important to Bilgi?</h4><p>Education cannot be separate from the world. The very word “universe" is part of “university," which is number one. Number two is opportunity; we want students to experience different cultures. The same concept I mentioned domestically is true internationally and is related to understanding different perspectives. It is important to understand even those who you may not like and understand where they are coming from. There may be disputes and issues, but that is why Bilgi wants to unify students and join the Laureate network. Furthermore, we wanted to build a true network, not just an exchange program, so that we are on one campus but utilizing multiple campuses worldwide under the same conditions. I think that is the main difference that we aim to make.</p><h4>Why is Turkey such a large exporter of students?</h4><p>In terms of exporting students versus importing students, we have a big deficit. Turkey is one of the top seven countries that send students abroad. Malaysia has a population of 34 million and they import 80,000 full tuition-paying students. Turkey is over double the size of Malaysia, but we are only importing one-third of that at 24,000, and 9,000 are on full scholarship from the Turkic countries of the CIS. I believe this caught Prime Minister Erdoğan's attention, and through the association we had and through the Union of Chambers and Commodity Exchanges of Turkey (TOBB) we jointly worked on developing incentives to bring international students to Turkey. Now there is actually a high-targeted market that would put us at number five in the world. There is a target, by 2023, to bring 250,000 international students to Turkey. Of course, this will require major reforms related to teaching, instruction, language, quality, accommodation, and transport.</p><h4>Is it a priority for Turkey to attract more international students?</h4><p>For private universities here, it is a business opportunity. Eventually supply and demand might become an issue. If you look at North Cyprus, its universities are surviving through the attraction of international students. It was a problem for them when Turkish students stopped attending and they had to solve this issue. I think it will become a problem for Turkey, and not just for that purpose but because of diversification as well. I think the chalk will be picked up by the private side rather than the state. The established schools in the three major cities will have to pursue this initiative, and of course they will gain tuition out of it; education is not going to be free for international students. Furthermore, I believe it will present an opportunity to have the classroom in a better environment. There will be different languages of instruction, and I think the one thing that the country needs more of is English speakers. Even though people in the major cities do speak English, it is not at the standard that you need if you want to be an international player. If you want to be in the top-10 largest economies, you need to have these tools in place.</p><h4>How would you assess the ability of Turkey's secondary education system to prepare students for the workforce?</h4><p>I think there is a lot of work to do. The system is young, universities are still being established, and because of the absence of competition, the level of innovation is low. Now, there is more competition—not just between each other, but with the state as well, because we are going after the same students. The problem is that in the demassification phase there are many new universities in the system. Even we as Bilgi, a 16-year old institution, are seen as an old institution, which should not be the case. We need a much longer cycle to become regarded as a “real" university in essence. Turkish secondary education is now crawling up, taking time to develop. We started walking and are now we are running, and that is the best way to describe it. There will be some institutions that stand out, but as an entire system we need to go through that cycle. That is why many Turkish students go abroad to university; to buy the education that is better outside and then come back to Turkey. That will change in time with the introduction of more dual degrees. However, it will also take time to get a qualified workforce coming through. The government has marked a target of 2023 as the year that Turkish secondary education should be sufficiently reformed.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Mozambique's significance to Odebrecht both regionally and globally?</h4><p>Since we re-launched operations here in 2006, Odebrecht has prioritized Mozambique. Odebrecht has been here for six years now and it has been involved in the one of the most important projects—the Moatize Coal Project with Vale—with works developed in Moatize and Beira. The opportunity to develop other projects, such as logistics for the mining and oil and gas sectors as well as in the agribusiness and energy sector, makes Mozambique extremely important for our strategic growth in Africa for the next few years.</p><h4>Aside from logistics and construction, which areas are the most attractive for Odebrecht to invest in?</h4><p>We are developing a project in the Nacala Corridor connected to agribusiness. Odebrecht is trying to replicate an experiment that it is doing in Brazil with modified cassava starch. There is a huge demand for it worldwide; however, there is not much production. There is an amazing quantity of products that use cassava starch. We are conducting market studies to see where we are going to sell it. In Brazil, we are developing a few markets, even with petrochemicals.</p><div class="quote">“Mozambique is extremely important for our strategic growth in Africa for the next few years."</div><h4>What will be the financial scale of the cassava project?</h4><p>For the first phase our forecast is $40 million, generating revenues in the vicinity of $5 million to $6 million per year. That investment will be for the production of the cassava, processing it, and generating the modified starch.</p><h4>How has Odebrecht taken advantage of working with Brazilian mining giant Vale to leverage further business opportunities in Mozambique?</h4><p>Our relationship with Vale started more than 30 years ago in Brazil; being part of its first greenfield coal mining development outside of Brazil was of the utmost importance to us. Now, we have been able to get to know the market better, create opportunities, and make the most of the good relationships between the governments of Brazil and Mozambique. Our next project will be an industrial duty-free zone in Nacala. It will establish the infrastructure for companies and provide water, power, and all the services needed. This should be ready in two years.</p><h4>How is the company contributing to human capital development in Mozambique?</h4><p>We have a project called the Acreditar program. It was initially developed in Brazil and then taken to other countries such as Mozambique, Angola, Peru, and Colombia. It took us one year to adapt the didactic material and to train the trainers in Mozambique. We started the first groups one year ago and had very good results. We already have 1,300 people certified at different levels through the program. They are not our workers; it is focused on the communities close to our projects. Of course, at the end we intend to hire most of those people. We have specific modules for developing the trainees, such as ironworkers, masons, carpenters, equipment operators, and trades like that. These are positions that are in high demand. Likewise, we are going to universities and developing a program to hire engineers, business students, economists, and lawyers. We start working with students in their last semester at university to steep them in our entrepreneurial culture. We could say the “Mozambicanization" of our operations will be based on bringing those young people into our organization. We have to develop our own people. In 2011, we brought in 10 people from universities, and in 2012 we are aiming at hiring 20 students for the long term.</p><h4>To what extent does Odebrecht's entrepreneurial philosophy give it a competitive advantage in Mozambique?</h4><p>One of the main principles of our philosophy is decentralization. We utilize delegation for making decisions in terms of developing the market. Local presence and empowerment to decision makers here makes a big difference. The training programs and the development of local people and programs that we create also give us a competitive advantage. The other aspects of our philosophy are focusing on our clients and their satisfaction. We have been practicing profit sharing with our workers for more than 60 years now, all the way down to the lower level people working out in the field.</p><h4>How can companies like Odebrecht tackle associated challenges in developing and financing large-scale infrastructure projects?</h4><p>Given the country's political and economic stability, it has attracted the attention of various stakeholders interested in developing not only mining and oil and gas-related projects, but also in infrastructure, such as ports, railroads, and airports. A public-private partnership (PPP) legal framework is in place, which gives investors more confidence. Nevertheless, the learning curve is still there, so it may take longer than we would like, but we are optimistic that the country is on the right path in creating solid foundations for the development of badly needed infrastructure.</p><h4>How can Odebrecht maximize investment opportunities in the real estate sector?</h4><p>Our focus in the real estate sector is due to the main stakeholders in large projects, such as oil and gas and mining companies. In Angola, we have been working in this segment for more than 10 years and it is our intention to implement it in Mozambique.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How important is the Mexican market for Xerox?</h4><p>The past year has been very special for Xerox Mexicana given that we celebrated our 50th anniversary. This event was extremely important for us because Mexico is our oldest affiliate in Latin America and one of our oldest affiliates in the world. Mexico continues to be one of the most important markets for Xerox, as it is where we first began in the Latin American market, and we continue developing our services widely throughout the region. Overall, 2012 was not only important to us because we celebrated our anniversary, but also because we launched several initiatives related to this milestone. We are taking advantage of our 50 years of experience. Our track record of operations provides us with the experience, talent, and the different aspects that we need in order to replicate and develop in other Latin American markets. As a company, we have evolved tremendously, and since we are a technology-oriented organization we have always been at the forefront and kept up with the market's rapid pace. We have had significant technological launches in products and services, and this has helped us to evolve year after year, always looking for a way to reinvent ourselves from the quality perspective, yet maintaining the ethical values that are at our core.</p><h4>In what ways is Xerox Mexicana trying to evolve brand perception?</h4><p>One of our main initiatives is to build a different image for Xerox. We are proud of our reputation for service and technology, but one of the main ideas that customers have about Xerox is that we are primarily focused on equipment. This is particularly due to the photocopy machine, which the company invented a long time ago, and is naturally part of our legacy. However, Xerox has developed many other lines of business over the last few years, and we want to get the word out about what kind of solutions we can provide to the market and all of the other high-end technology we continue to develop. Three years ago we completed the acquisition of ACS, which has been renamed Xerox Services. This component of the company is completely integrated and offers customer care, information technology outsourcing (ITO), and business process outsourcing (BPO). We continue to expand our portfolio of solutions as we target bigger markets and invest in countries like Mexico. Xerox Mexicana has offered the Mexican market end-to-end solutions for companies of all sizes, not just in document printing, but also in integrated approaches to document management, including development, distribution, storage, sharing, and reuse. While the printing market is still very relevant, we are developing more solutions aimed toward the flow of user information, serving both types of market demands. In our business model, the channel represents all that is end-user facing and coverage, which is why one of our main priorities is to continually develop business strategies and programs that provide training and tangible benefits to our business partners. With this, we expect to achieve engagement and loyalty toward our brand and to offer the best service to our end users. Xerox Partner Print Services (XPPS) is the next generation of solutions for Managed Print Services with the Xerox brand for the channel, sharing our global expertise and proven technology with the Mexican market through certified distributors. We also offer our clients an extensive array of communications and marketing services, which are implemented through our high-end technology and support of consultants. These services are intended to help our clients generate 360° communications with all of their users and customers, sharing the right message, at the right time, to the right market segment. Our processes enable us to create personalized content offering results and benefiting brand maintenance while reducing production costs. As an example in Mexico, the telecommunications and retail industries have experienced significant success using our communications and marketing services, reducing costs and time by 30% and 42%, respectively.</p><div class="quote">“We intend to maintain our reputation by offering quality services at the right prices."</div><h4>Today, the company makes half of its revenues from business processes. How significant will this area be in the future?</h4><p>Half of our revenue streams come from services. The technology stream remains very strong and we intend to maintain it as a driver in our business. However, the business services line is providing us with strong leverage. We are capable of offering end-to-end BPO solutions for small, medium, and large corporations for all back office needs. Some examples include invoicing, delivering, and storing accounting information and sharing it with customers. We provide support on how to improve productivity for current business processes, and we externalize these solutions to help keep our clients focused on their core business. The company's broad portfolio includes a wide array of both human resources solutions and accounting solutions. In ITO we are able to provide the full outsourcing of data centers, including assets acquisition, IT experts, and numerous additional processes. We are investing substantially in the call center business and are evaluating how to make this business line grow within the Mexican market. We could say our sights are set on every potential market because we serve all industries, such as manufacturing, banking and finance, and telecommunications, and we are considering venturing into mining. There is no one-size solution for all, but we can offer customized solutions that are applicable toward any industry. At this time, we have focused on serving the needs of SMEs, where we have found a natural segment given the conditions that we have, not just as a country, but as a region that is growing quickly.</p><h4>How sophisticated is the Mexican market in terms of demand for back-office business processes?</h4><p>Mexico is a mature market compared to the rest of Latin America. Compared to the rest of the world, we believe we need to explore the level of maturity in different business lines. The market trend is pointing in this direction and the Mexican market demands these kinds of solutions, but we need to work with our customers to develop these support and consulting services. Customers know what they need, but Xerox needs to work with them to develop solutions. They need help identifying where and how to apply the solutions. We help them understand how they can be more productive by implementing innovative solutions.</p><h4>What are some of the innovations you have brought to the market recently?</h4><p>Currently we are working aggressively toward communicating the solutions we offer to the market, all aimed at raising awareness. Many solutions are available worldwide, but the local market continues to lack many services. One of the critical key performance indicators is how to monitor the implementation of business solutions. On PowerPoint, every solution works, but when you start implementing and integrating critical processes, it's not the same. You need the infrastructure, experience, and talented people to do it right, and this is what we can offer. We have a strong presence in Mexico, and with over 4,000 employees we are capable of offering solutions that go from design to implementation. As we work with more companies, we also grow and learn, and since every customer is different, we learn from every experience we encounter. In the past, on the technology side, we launched something new every year; now we release new products every quarter. We developed a new, environmentally friendly way of printing, called “ColorQube." This technology uses solid ink, like a crayon, which can be used instead of toner. ColorQube is one of our biggest investments in the last five years, and we have a family of products that are 100% environmentally friendly, from the production of the cartridges, to the consumables, to the energy used. One of our advantages is that we have narrowed the space between black and white and color with these new developments, and we are very proud of that.</p><h4>Do you receive a significant demand from the public as well as the private sector?</h4><p>Through our Managed Print Services (MPS) platform, we already offer solutions to large corporations and SMEs, after having developed over 9,400 patents and the support of over 50 years of market experience. Our business strategy is to continue promoting these kinds of solutions in the public sector as well, where there is tremendous business opportunity by helping government entities to improve work processes through document management and digitalization, managing work flows and services. Public sector demand is growing and we believe there is a strong opportunity in this market, where we are developing specific initiatives to increase our activity. We have a lot of experience in the sector and with our specialized business partners, which allows us to deliver the right solutions for market needs.</p><h4>How is the company dealing with increased competition in the market as the economy develops?</h4><p>Emerging markets are critical for every company now, and Mexico is one of the largest markets. Competition is always good because it drives us to be more competitive and provide better solutions to our customers. We are not concerned about competition because we have substantial experience in adding to a legacy of high quality. We intend to maintain our reputation by offering quality services at the right prices. To be successful, companies need to be competitive in terms of pricing. We have to be competitive to be a viable option for our customers. Pricing is not our top priority; however, we aim to provide the right solutions and understand the customers' needs perfectly before we look at pricing. We must always consider the differentiation between business lines and tailor our solutions accordingly. The company always evaluates its competitiveness and competition is always present.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the advantages of the recently signed free trade agreements (FTAs) with the US and EU for Colombia?</h4><p>The signing of the FTA with the US, which took effect in May 2011, and the agreement with the EU, which we expect to enter into force in 2013, are both milestones in the history of our foreign trade. These are our main economic partners, and they are two of the most dynamic economies in the world. They represent great opportunities for our exporters of goods and services. As a result of the FTA with the US, expectations point to the creation of 500,000 new jobs and, based on quantitative studies, an increase in GDP of between 0.5% and 1%. It is also projected that in the five years following the implementation of the agreement, the economy will grow an extra percentage point and unemployment will be lowered by two points. As for the EU, we will be able to access 27 countries, with over 503 million inhabitants and an average consumption per capita of $34,000, which is four times that of Colombia. This gives an idea as to the EU's purchasing power. Trade, FDI, and tourism with the EU and the US have shown significant dynamics. Between January and September 2012, exports from Colombia to the US grew 6.7%, and the trade balance showed a surplus of $6.64 billion. Also in this period, 20.9% of the foreign visitors that entered Colombia came from there. And regarding FDI from the US to Colombia, it reached $268 million, excluding the oil sector, in the first half of 2012. As for the EU, Colombia's exports to this bloc grew 4.1% in the first nine months of 2012, which yielded a positive trade balance of over $1.19 billion. During this period, 16.9% (199,645) of the foreign visitors that entered the country came from the EU.</p><h4>What are the prospects for FTAs with other nations, and in what areas does Colombia need to improve to make the FTA boom successful?</h4><p>We have set the goal of having a total of 18 trade agreements negotiated by 2014. On this front, we have concluded negotiations with South Korea, and we are continuing negotiations with Israel, Turkey, Costa Rica, and Panama. We have also advanced contacts for the start of negotiations with Japan, the Dominican Republic, Australia, and China, among other countries. Moreover, we aim to advance further through agreements with the Pacific Alliance, the countries of the Northern Triangle of Central America, and Uruguay so as to improve the integration of Latin America. These agreements will open up great opportunities for the producers of goods and services in an expanded market of 1.5 billion inhabitants. We are also making great efforts to improve competitiveness in all of the areas that this concerns, such as in road infrastructure and the renovation of seaports and airports, among others. To this end, the Santos administration has announced significant investment over the short and medium term. Furthermore, another major challenge is to achieve real access for our products, especially those of agribusiness. Here, we have been working on an agenda to meet the eligibility requirements for sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) standards, which has included the Agricultural Institute of Colombia and Invima. In respect to trade promotion and making the best use of our trade agreements, we have been strengthening the programs and initiatives that aim to manage and develop the best conditions of access. To this end, we have relied on the support of Proexport, which has been conducting outreach programs and facilitating export and investment activities.</p><div class="quote">“Today, Colombia has become one of the best countries in the protection of foreign investment."</div><h4>What are Colombia's advantages as a destination for foreign investment?</h4><p>Today, Colombia has become one of the best countries in the protection of foreign investment and herein is the reason for our boom in this indicator. According to reports from the Bank of the Republic, as of November 2, 2012, over $14.16 billion had entered the country. This is an increase of 12.9% when compared to the same period last year, which came in at over $11.52 billion. Other significant factors that have contributed to this good performance include the progress that we have made in our agenda of trade and investment agreements and the improvements that have been made in our business climate, as well as the excellent management that Proexport has shown in promoting the country as a destination that is well suited for the creation of companies. As for our investment goals, we seek to have 16 international agreements in force, which means 10 more than the six that this administration has already begun. These new countries include Canada, the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), India, the US, China, the UK, South Korea, Japan, Turkey, and the EU. During this administration, we aim to establish stable rules for investment with these countries.</p><h4>In what sectors are you seeing increasing activity and from which markets?</h4><p>So far over 2012 we have observed that the commerce, restaurant, and hotel sectors have been the most attractive to foreign investors. In the first half of 2012, they received $811 million in foreign investment, which is $202 million more than in the same period in 2011. Other sectors that have been gaining ground include oil, mining, and quarrying (including coal), agriculture, hunting, forestry and fishing, electricity, gas, and water, as well as financial and business services. By country of origin, during the first half of 2012, the top investors in Colombia (excluding the oil sector) were Chile ($386.9 million), Anguilla ($315.6 million), the US ($268 million), Panama ($233.9 million), Bermuda ($212.3 million), the UK ($171.9 million), Canada ($115.8 million), Brazil ($92.8 million), Peru ($83.9 million), and the Netherlands ($82.8 million).</p><h4>What measures is the government taking to further boost investors' confidence in the country?</h4><p>In terms of boosting investor confidence, we have been accepted into the Investment Committee of the OECD, adhered to the Declaration on Foreign Investment and Multinational Enterprises, and made important progress with the Trade Committee of that organization. Other advances include the signing of the Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) with Japan and the conclusion of BIT negotiations with Turkey in March 2012. We have also included an investment chapter in our negotiations for an FTA with South Korea, and we have opened negotiations for an instrument to promote and protect investments with Israel, Costa Rica, Singapore, and the countries of the Pacific Alliance. Moreover, we have seen the entry into force of four international investment agreements that have been previously negotiated with Canada, China, India, and the US, which brings the total number of international investment agreements in force to 11. And lastly, we are continuously working to improve our Doing Business indicators, in order to be among those countries with the best business climate.</p><h4>When do you believe Colombia will be joining the OECD and why is this important for the country?</h4><p>As an integration strategy into the world economy, we have been advancing a plan for Colombia to be accepted into the OECD. This will allow us to benefit from the work and experiences of leading countries in formulating public policy. It will also allow us to become part of a group of nations that seek development and progress for their peoples. Our goal is to be accepted into this organization in two years' time. Colombia's entry into the OECD will require compliance with all the social and economic commitments of the organization. We have officially formalized Colombia as a full member of the Investment Group of the OECD, and we currently participate in several committees. Additionally, various members of this group, such as the US, Italy, France, Poland, and South Korea have said that they will back Colombia's candidacy. OECD membership would help Colombia to become an even better country in which to do business, and it would help us to increase foreign investment, make a qualitative leap in our development policy, and improve the overall quality of our public policies, among other things.</p><h4>What are the priorities of the government regarding Colombia's position on the continent and relations with its neighboring countries?</h4><p>In Colombia, at the moment, we are in a process of catching up in respect to our trade agenda, and this initiative includes the countries of the region and our neighbors. We are consolidating the Pacific Alliance, a bloc that is initially comprised of Mexico, Chile, Peru, and Colombia. Through this, we aim to strengthen our relationships at all levels, such as in trade, investment, and tourism. And this goes not only for these four markets alone, but also for others that wish to join and who have their eyes on Asia. One of the recent results of this initiative, for example, was the decision to eliminate the visa that was required for Colombians to travel to Mexico. Furthermore, the Partial Scope Agreement (PSA) with our neighbor and natural partner, Venezuela, has just come into force, and we are also increasingly deepening our relations with Panama and Costa Rica, as well as evaluating our alliances with the Dominican Republic.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the performance of the Colombian economy in 2013 and beyond?</h4><p>The Colombian economy is on a solid track, and we aim to keep up this positive performance over the coming years. To this end, the Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Tourism has established clear goals, which include boosting the nation's non-mining/non-energy exports to roughly $20 billion, half of which will be from the 16 high-potential sectors that are currently enrolled in the Productive Transformation Program (PTP), as well as gaining preferential access to a market of over 1.3 billion consumers through our various trade agreements that are in place, signed, or under negotiation. And, of course, we aim to welcome over 3.6 million foreign visitors to the country.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>With such a strong economy, what further measures are needed for Mozambique to be upgraded from its current B+ sovereign rating?</h4><p>What is needed is to provide full and accurate information to the rating agencies. We must explain what we are doing and be honest. For example, if you are interviewing people from the private sector and ask their opinion on credit, they will say that interest rate levels are not promoting growth, but they will not tell you about the reasons behind the high interest rates or what they can do to improve the investment climate. The rating agencies base their current assessment on the global recession. We have implemented a number of reforms since then, and I believe these will help.</p><h4>How would you characterize foreign investor interest in Mozambican sovereign bonds?</h4><p>The way to finance our current account deficit is either by issuing treasury bonds internally or externally, or through borrowing on concessional terms. The government performs a combination of internal and external borrowing. If you look at our budget deficit as a percentage of GDP after grants, it stands at 5%, which is a reasonable level for macroeconomic stability. If you associate this with a stable exchange rate and low inflation, you can see that there is still a window for foreign investors to come and invest.</p><div class="quote">“SMEs are the key players in the creation of jobs and sustainable growth."</div><h4>Is the creation of a sovereign wealth fund necessary as a mechanism to manage Mozambique's anticipated natural resources revenue boom?</h4><p>There are rumors about exchange rate appreciation and “Dutch Disease," but we are ready to manage that situation. First of all, it is important to underline that we have a free-floating exchange regime. Second, we still have a current account deficit as well as mega projects in the process of investment, which means we are importing equipment from abroad. With the current account deficit, there is no reason for the appreciation of the local currency, but rather there is an argument for its depreciation. Dutch Disease can happen when you have a surplus and you want to appreciate your currency. In our view, an appreciation of the metical (MZN) could damage other sectors, even if the mega projects continue to export. We are following the real exchange rate and observing the level that can keep the economy competitive. In 2010, we had abnormal depreciation. We reached a situation where $1 was MZN39 or MZN40. This depreciation resulted from the delay in the reimbursement of funds by donors. We are trying to achieve a level of equilibrium and, from our calculations, the balanced exchange rate is something around MZN29 per US dollar. So, at the moment, there is no risk of appreciation, even with the large gas and coal exports.</p><h4>What will your policies be to keep the metical stable in 2018, when gas exports begin?</h4><p>We will have to process some of the locally produced raw materials. For many years, we have been exporting all our commodities without processing them locally first. If you want to process resources locally, then you need to make a huge investment and import equipment. Suppose you want to process gas; you will need to liquefy it. This means you will have to import equipment first, and if you want to use the gas for energy then you need to have the necessary equipment. This means that the exchange rate will be an important variable. The assumption of appreciation is that you will have huge exports. However, what the development policy says is that some of these products will have to be processed locally, which entails importing equipment. The exchange rate will not be fixed. For example, you cannot develop industry without energy, but you can use the energy to develop the country. A fund can be seen as taking this export revenue and putting it in a foreign bank. You can use a bank for price stabilization and you can use the stabilization fund for this purpose. I do not expect appreciation to happen because the economy is moving forward. I believe the economy will be able to absorb any appreciation because part of the fund will be used for stabilization and the other part will be used for development. The development part of the fund is the absorption of the revenue, which can offset the eventual currency appreciation.</p><h4>One of the biggest problems for SMEs is their credit access capacity. How important is it to integrate microfinance into the financial system to develop Mozambique's economy?</h4><p>We are discussing with different partners about how we can make credit available for SMEs. We do not have a problem with the financing aspect, but rather with how to organize those who are interested in developing a business. You have to train these people in how to organize a company and how to make a project worthy of investment. The first stage is organization; the second stage is accessing credit. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce is allowing us to set up a program for SME development. We have introduced seven such programs for SMEs in the past. Once the companies have been trained, we can mobilize local resources. The third stage is that we can use resources from the international market. There is still a window for us to raise cheaper money from abroad, but first we have to organize the sector to use this kind of program.</p><h4>Only 22% of adults have a bank account in Mozambique. What are your goals to improve financial literacy and increase the banking rate?</h4><p>We are doing two things. First, we started a program in 2007 that establishes incentives for commercial banks intending to open branches in rural areas. For example, if a bank imports equipment for allocation to rural areas, it pays lower taxes. This incentive package was set up in coordination with the Ministry of Finance. The second incentive was in terms of reserve requirements. For example, a bank in a rural or remote area can use the cash that it has deposited with the central bank. This means the level of reserve requirements will remain lower. In 2007, commercial bank branches only covered 28 districts, and now the number has increased to 58 districts. In addition, with new mobile technology, we can make financial inclusion even more popular. We are using mobile providers to transfer money from one place to another. Today, there is a substantial increase in the amount of people that use this method to transfer money. Secondly, we also have a program to educate our population about different financial products offered by the commercial banks.</p><h4>What is the potential for additional foreign banks to enter the market?</h4><p>Mozambique is a huge country, and despite the achievements in terms of district coverage, we have 128 districts overall and not all of them have branches. There is an opportunity for a bank to establish operations in these areas. Certain banks only want to establish themselves in the capital city to make money through export and import intermediation; however, for us, the government is the key for developing infrastructure such as electricity, communications, roads, and so on. There is a huge potential in rural areas, especially in agriculture. There are farmers who would like to increase their area of production, but cannot because they are unable to access credit. Farmers are selling their crops, but they have no bank branch in which to deposit their money. The existing commercial banks are not enough to cover the country's needs. With mega projects, some banks are accessing external financing. The idea is that local commercial banks with a good capital base could be the intermediaries for mega projects. There are logistics for mega projects that need to be financed. The existing banks do not have enough capital to intermediate the import and export needs for mega projects. There are international investors involved in mega projects that would like to establish subsidiaries in our country to better serve their existing customers. By 2014, I believe we will see more foreign banks receiving licenses in Mozambique.</p><h4>What are the main structural challenges Mozambique faces economically in the next few years, and how will you tackle them?</h4><p>Training is the first challenge. We need skilled people. We are in a new era where we have to deal with gas, coal, and other minerals. Second, in our financial sector, we have to look at the capital base of the banking sector. The banks need to leverage their capital so that they can be relevant in this new era. Third is to monitor policy challenges; how can we organize ourselves to stave off Dutch Disease? Mega projects are more capital intensive, but are not necessarily labor intensive. SMEs are the key players in the creation of jobs and sustainable growth. We must combine mega projects with SMEs. In order to avoid a situation like that in the EU or the US, we must ensure that the banks are properly managed and the risks we take are in accordance with credit regulations.</p><h4>Do you foresee regulations accommodating foreign requests to diversify products in the financial sector?</h4><p>Yes, there are already some financial institutions contracted to learn a new approach on how to raise funds for the economy. I have spoken with the IFC and it is considering buying meticais. Changing the regulations is possible provided that we are not putting the financial sector in danger. With high inflation, investors will not invest in Mozambique, interest rates will increase, and those on a low income will become even poorer. Macroeconomic fundamentals must be preserved.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the significance of Tag Heuer's presence at the 2012 Women In Leadership (WIL) conference in Dubai?</h4><p>The role of any company is to make profit. But at Tag Heuer, and more globally within our group, Louis Vuitton Moí«t Hennessy (LVMH), we try to go beyond this and give back to the community. We've been here for many years and have partnered with non-profit organizations including Save the Children. We now have Cameron Diaz and UN Women promoting equality for ladies around the world. In that respect, it is good for us to be there. We are also promoting green issues. If you go to visit our factory in Switzerland, you'll see the roof is covered in solar power cells; a large part of the energy we use is powered by these cells. We're also promoting electric cars. Several years ago we organized the first trip around the world in an electric car, in partnership with US company Tesla.</p><h4>How are women important to a company like Tag Heuer?</h4><p>For us, women are very important. Around 40% of our customers are women, meaning they are a huge part of our business. At LVMH and Tag Heuer, 60% of our top positions are held by women. At LVMH, there are a lot of female CEOs. The executive committee of TAG Heuer is composed of four people; two men and two women. It's very balanced.</p><div class="quote">“The Middle East, as a whole, is a big region and it generates close to 10% of our worldwide turnover."</div><h4>You've said that a watch designed by women for women is more powerful than for men. Can you elaborate on that?</h4><p>When a watch is made for ladies, many companies take a watch for men and just reduce the size. The new LINK Ladies watch features a redesigned strap and case, which is nothing like you'd see on a men's watch. It has been designed from scratch for ladies and it is more elegant.</p><h4>Why is Dubai a good market for Tag Heuer?</h4><p>The Middle East, as a whole, is a big region and it generates close to 10% of our worldwide turnover, so it's important. Some brands manage their operations here from Switzerland. However, in luxury, as in any market, you have to be in the field to answer what your customer needs. It's important for us to be here day-to-day with our partners so that we can feel the market.</p><h4>You have re-launched your store in BurJuman Mall and have 13 boutiques across the Middle East. Are there any plans to go further?</h4><p>In the future, if we could have one or two additional boutiques, that would be nice. Today in Dubai for example, we have one in BurJuman and one in Dubai Mall. I think we are missing one in the Mall of the Emirates, for example, but there is a very long waiting list.</p><h4>Have you found that retail in Dubai is picking up following the financial crisis?</h4><p>The entire region is fantastic. Today, within Tag Heuer, it's the fastest-growing market in the Middle East. We are growing this year by much more than 30% compared to last year. When I speak to people who have been in Dubai many years, they tell me the financial crisis was the best thing to happen because it was getting too crazy. There was no rationality, and thanks to the crisis people are now beginning to think rationally again in terms of planning. We're part of LVMH, and despite the crisis we were growing. We're growing more than 25% in France and in Germany for example. In times of crisis, people go back to the fundamentals. They want to buy something that makes them happy. The brands that suffer are not the real luxury brands. Maybe when everything is nice, people will try new upcoming brands and go for crazy things, but in times of crisis, they go back to the real, true, legitimate luxury brands. This year, globally speaking, will be our best year ever and 2013 will prove to be good as well.</p><h4>What impact does brand awareness have in a region like Dubai?</h4><p>Most of the people who buy in Dubai are expatriates or tourists, and only 5% or 10% are locals. That means that the stronger the brand is outside Dubai, the better it is for us here. In countries like Kuwait or Saudi Arabia we are doing well also, but it's mostly with the local population.</p><h4>What are your targets for 2013?</h4><p>For me I'm very confident for 2013. While presenting my budgets in Switzerland in late 2012, I assured the management of large growth. The fundamentals in the region are quite good. The countries are putting much effort into structuring their economies. Saudi Arabia is putting a lot of new laws in place, starting to authorize foreign investment, and developing accounting and financial laws. In Dubai, it's been a long time since the authorities were dependent on oil and gas income, but in Qatar they are also really starting to think of what will come after.</p><h4>What sets Tag Heuer apart from its competition?</h4><p>We've been Swiss avant garde since 1860. At Tag Heuer, we always try to do things differently. We are always making different types of innovation. Tag Heuer was the first to make watches keep time to 1/100th of a second, and to 1/1,000th of a second. Tag Heuer is the brand that is shaking the rules and trying to play outside of the box. We try to play to our own trends. We see the rule and we to try escape it!</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has lead to the success of VTB in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>The key to our success is in providing the best services in the present market conditions. The development of services, procedures, and technologies for banking are in their early stages in this country. Certainly, to attract new customers, offering lower interest rates is an effective way to increase business volume. The low economic efficiency of banks is disproportionate to the level of risks in operations and the level of expenses. This, in turn, leads to bigger problems rather than positive outcomes—even in the medium term. Currently, all progressive banks realize that and direct their efforts toward the improvement of client services and the optimization of procedures. Our bank has a unique opportunity to properly build its decisions and choose approaches based on the enormous experience of VTB Group's banks in such countries as Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Georgia. By analyzing the best practices and knowledge of the group, we know exactly what effects our decisions and approaches have on the organization of the banking business. We understand how to build an effective IT system and a reliable risk management system. Despite the fact that we are not a large bank in Azerbaijan, we have been making very ambitious plans and working hard to achieve them. For the past 10 months the bank has increased its monthly volume of credit operations by 8.5 fold, and as a result we have gone up eight places in the bank rating list. For us, 2012 is the year of increased activity in the field of auto loans and small business. At the moment, we are actively working with well-known brand names in Azerbaijan such as Kia, Chevrolet, and Hyundai. We are steadily increasing turnover by providing credit to small business, ensuring the growth of a credit portfolio in this segment at a much higher speed than the market in general. Another priority area of our activity, which we intend to launch on a mass scale at the beginning of 2013, is a type of retail cash loan, and especially POS-credit. We are planning to open five new branches and more than 30 remote points of sales in Baku by the end of 2013. The corporate business in Azerbaijan has its own specialties. Many large business groups or holdings have a bank of their own, which generally serves the interests of the company. It is clear that to enter into such a market is a little difficult. However, we consider that VTB can become a serious player in this sphere as well. The organizational and technical capacities of VTB Group and, certainly, resource capacity, allow us to attract investment under very favorable conditions, and this gives us confidence. Despite the fact that, at the moment, VTB has a small amount of cumulative capital in Azerbaijan and can't directly provide credit to the representatives of large Azerbaijani businesses, VTB Group actively carries on negotiations and credits with such clients from its parent bank, using VTB Azerbaijan as the reliable partner and the agent for these deals. This additional part of the business is also actively developing with the Moscow office of VTB as well as VTB Capital in London.</p><h4>How would you explain your current growth trend?</h4><p>We have developed our team and implemented new procedures and approaches. Such huge success can't depend on just one person, however. Many new people from the local market, from other countries, and from our Russian retail bank VTB 24 were involved. It allowed us to establish a motivated team that could roll up their sleeves to work and achieve the results demanded.</p><div class="quote">“The organizational and technical capacities of VTB Group... allow us to attract investment under very favorable conditions."</div><h4>How would you characterize the present atmosphere for banks in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>The banking sector in Azerbaijan has exited the crisis. The crisis did not hit Azerbaijan as strongly as it did other countries, but a delay in the development of the banking sector afterward was inevitable. The crisis forced everyone to look critically at approaches and rules, as well as analyze risks. Some of the banks haven't made appropriate conclusions in the field of risk management, and may step on the same rake once again. Others, after the stabilization of commodity prices, started to again pay less attention to gaps in liquidity. At the same time, the majority of banks learned to count money and to estimate the profitability of operations, having essentially intensified highly remunerative operations in the retail business. To compare with the seasons, I would characterize the current period for banks in Azerbaijan as a spring after a winter of crisis. I expect a hot summer ahead.</p><h4>What benefits does the partnership with ATA Holding bring?</h4><p>ATA Holding is the second-largest private holding in the country, meaning it is a serious and powerful partner. This partnership has helped us to be better known and have more weight in the Azerbaijani market at the initial stage of the project. First of all, if we had a question about the current market, or its changes, we could always receive qualified consultation from our partners. Secondly, we always receive the necessary support and help from our respected partner, which has huge contacts in the country's business sector. Along with this, it is necessary to emphasize that our relations were very correct, and we always felt great support from ATA Holding during the development of the strategic plans of our affiliated bank, VTB Group, according to group standards.</p><h4>What, in your opinion, are the most significant changes occurring from an investment perspective?</h4><p>The country is in an extremely stable condition. The financial system, reserves, budgets, economic development, and national currency show enviable stability in comparison with the other countries of the former Soviet Union. There are enormous natural resources in the country. The funds earned by the country through the exploitation of oil have boosted economic development. Azerbaijan has become not only an attractive country for foreign investment, but has started to invest in diversifying its portfolio. It seems to me that this tendency of investment attractiveness will continue in the coming years.</p><h4>What is your forecast for economic development in 2013?</h4><p>It will be a very stable year. The funds earned mainly from the oil sector will be further invested in infrastructure projects and production. Further growth of the state oil operator SOCAR and the launch of new projects will contribute to growth. There are also positive forecasts for stability and the stabilization of the national currency. The strategic goals of VTB Azerbaijan in the upcoming three years are to become one of the top-10 banks in the country and achieve a 15% capital return rate. We believe that our business will grow 100 times bigger than it is now. According to our plans, the aim for 2013 is to ensure the maximum growth of assets and volume of operations. We are aiming for assets of AZN205 million, 325 personnel, seven branches, and 42 points of sale.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Pacific Rubiales evolved since it was establish in 2007, and how has the energy sector changed?</h4><p>At that time, Colombia was producing 580,000 barrels per day (bbl/d), and today we are producing 970,000 bbl/d. It has increased by about 400,000 bbl/d. When we bought the Rubiales Field from Germán Efromovich, who owns Avianca and the Elliott Management hedge fund in New York, it was producing 14,000 bbl/d, and now we are producing 270,000 bbl/d five years later. Pacific Rubiales represents 250,000 bbl/d out of 400,000, or around 60% of this growth. We feel as though the planets have aligned. The new hydrocarbon policies of President Uribe and also the creation of the National Hydrocarbon Agency (ANH) have been very beneficial. When I came here, I founded Pacific Rubiales with my partners. Everything happened in July 2007, when we went to the Toronto stock market to raise capital. We created a very successful IPO and we have been growing ever since. You will not find another company that has grown like us. We produce a lot and our reserves went from 50 million bbl to close to 407 million bbl in 2011; we will have some very important additions in 2012 as well. We expect to have very important increases in reserves. Since Pacific Rubiales was founded in 2007, it has moved into other countries in the region. We are producing and exploring in Peru where we have four exploration blocks and one in production. We also have offshore fields in Brazil and Guyana, on the border with Venezuela. We are in Guatemala, and also in Papua New Guinea on the other side of the world. We went there because we received an offer we couldn't refuse. We were offered an excellent prospect, and it is probably the largest discovery I have ever seen in my life. Pacific Rubiales has grown from an IPO worth $400 million to beyond $8 billion in market capitalization. Pacific Rubiales has been very important for Colombia. Our investment is in the order of $2 billion a year, although that is not the net total of Pacific Rubiales. We have 62 blocks and nine in production. We do have some partners in these blocks; however, we are operators in all of our blocks. We expect the growth of the company to move up to 500,000 bbl/d over the next few years.</p><h4>To what do you attribute your success?</h4><p>As in any other business, it's all about location. You need to have the knowledge and understand the geology. If you do that, you will find oil. You will not find oil where there is none. In the past, Colombia had security problems and it was underexplored. We had the chance to come here at the right time. Since we understood the geology, we positioned the company in the heavy oil belt in Los Llanos, and that is why we have been so successful.</p><div class="quote">“Pacific Rubiales is now the largest independent oil company in Latin America."</div><h4>What is your overview for gas in Colombia, and what are the main challenges in this sector?</h4><p>We have 140 million standard cubic feet (scf) of production capacity; however, we can only transport about 65 million. The problem is with the regulations; in Colombia, you cannot be vertically integrated. If you are a producer you cannot be a transporter; if you are a transporter you cannot be a distributor. We cannot build a pipeline. With oil, we were transporting it all by road, about 70,000 barrels on 2,000 trucks. We had a pipeline on wheels. You can do that with oil, but not with natural gas. To get out of that bottleneck, we are building an energy plant with Exmar that will be a barge-mounted liquefaction plant. With that, we will serve the Caribbean region. It is not a large market, but there are very good margins because all these islands are using either diesel or fuel oil for power production. If you substitute that, the cost is about $20 per million British thermal units (btu). If you can sell that in Colombia for $5, you have a lot of room to improve by going from $5 to $20. Around 50% of our production would be exported to the Caribbean.</p><h4>What does Colombia need to do to maximize its oil and gas potential?</h4><p>In the past, the problem in Colombia was infrastructure. However, now the main problem in Colombia is that we have 2.3 billion bbl of oil in reserve and it is producing close to 1 million bbl/d. We have six to seven years at the existing production rate left. There is a lot of exploration, but it is difficult to find another oil giant here in Colombia. We will continue discovering oil, but not in the magnitudes of the past. The new frontiers will be in the south Putumayo region near Ecuador; however, there are some security concerns. Also, offshore Colombia has not been explored, as there are a lot of opportunities in the Caribbean and here in the Pacific. Most important is that there is no secondary recovery minimum. The secondary recovery for heavy oil is 15%, but if we use the proper technology, we can increase that to 50%. You can duplicate all of Colombia's reserves by applying secondary recovery technologies in just one field. We place a lot of importance in investing in technology, and that is what we are doing. We are paving the way for heavy oil.</p><h4>In 2011, you acquired 19% of CGX. What was the strategy behind this?</h4><p>Right now we have a 35% share of the company, and have increased our position. We knew there were two ways to get into Guyana. There are excellent offshore blocks there; the US Geological Survey says that there are over 6 billion bbl of oil reserves. We know that area well from when we were exploring Venezuelan waters and we hit five successful wells. We understand the area and we will use CGX rather than Pacific Rubiales because it has a long history there. CGX has been there from the very beginning, and has excellent relations with the government. Instead of going directly with Pacific Rubiales, we are investing through CGX, which is a Canadian company, and although we don't control it, we have a very important position.</p><h4>How would you assess security issues in the oil and gas sector?</h4><p>The security here in Colombia is great when you are away from the borders of Venezuela and Ecuador. We have never had an issue before, even when we were using our 2,000 trucks. The areas around the Venezuelan and Ecuadorean borders are complicated. If the government can reach an agreement with the FARC, things will change here. It is the last thing that Colombia needs to change for it to be a perfect country to invest in. I am optimistic. The country has been at war for decades, and the Colombian people just want peace and progress. There will be discussions and it will be a long, hard process, but they will get there.</p><h4>As Latin America's fourth largest oil producer, how do you see the energy sector evolving in the medium to long term, and where do you envision Pacific Rubiales in the future?</h4><p>Pacific Rubiales is now the largest independent oil company in Latin America. We see it taking a very important position here in Colombia. We are producing 270,000 bbl/d, which is very close to what Ecopetrol is producing. In Peru, we only produce 5,000 bbl/d at the moment. We have excellent prospects in Brazil and we feel optimistic about Guyana and Guatemala.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does Colombia play in Endesa's global strategy?</h4><p>At the moment, Colombia represents one of the key operations of our company in Latin America. Colombia accounts for 35% of Endesa's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) in Latin America; we will close 2012 with $2.5 billion, and we expect to reach $3.5 billion by 2016. Currently, we have around 1,600 employees.</p><h4>Endesa holds 48.48% controlling stakes in Codensa and Emgesa. How have Endesa's operations evolved in Colombia since it was established in 1997?</h4><p>Endesa's operations in Colombia are very stable and well balanced in the power generation segment with Emgesa, and in the distribution segment with Codensa. In 2012, we celebrated our 15th anniversary in the country, and over this period we have consolidated our operations in Colombia. We carried out economic and management restructuring strategies at both Emgesa and Codensa. We have grown in terms of power generation assets with, for example, the acquisition of the Cartagena plant and the merger with Betania, among others. We have ongoing plans to expand our power generation portfolio with projects such as the expansion of Salaco to 144 MW. We expect that over the next two years we will reach 3,500 MW of installed capacity. In the distribution field, we have a similar story; we could increase our customer portfolio to more than 700,000 people, and today we have around 2.7 million customers in Colombia. Additionally, we have improved our rate of energy loss from 23% to 7.4%, and that has contributed to providing operational stability. Furthermore, we acquired a minority stake in Empresa de Energí­a de Cundinamarca (EEC), which supplies more than 255,000 customers in the Cundinamarca region. In regards to this, Endesa is keen on acquiring more distribution companies in Colombia, and we would analyze any potential operation, because from the legal and regulatory points of view—this is a regulated business—we have room to grow from the current 21% to a maximum of 25%.</p><div class="quote">“Colombia's location and its energy production capacity are key elements for the country to increase energy production levels."</div><h4>What are your prospects for the “El Quimbo" project, and how will it impact the Colombian energy sector?</h4><p>The project was born after a tender process initiated by the Colombian government, which in 2008 carried out the first energy tender in order to boost the construction of new infrastructure to cover energy demands until 2018. We presented this project and were awarded with 1,650 GWh per year of energy. In November 2010, we started construction of the Quimbo project. We expect to launch operations in December 2014. The investment for this project is around $837 million, of which $143 million is strictly allocated for the social and environmental aspect of it. At the moment, we have completed over 30% of the project with an investment of more than $267 million. We have also successfully carried out resettlement works with local communities and conducted research that will enable us to relocate the area's wildlife with the lowest impact.</p><h4>What are the plans to export energy to Ecuador once the project is finished?</h4><p>As a company, we don't export; however, some countries have signed bilateral energy agreements, like in the particular case of Colombia and Ecuador, and we are looking forward to boosting energy interconnections between Colombia and Panama. Generation companies only take part in the offering of energy, and governments alone decide whether they import or export it. In the last few years, and thanks to its strong and reliable hydroelectric energy matrix, Colombia has exported this energy to other countries, and we get our proportional take according to our levels of generation. I would also like to add that energy interconnections between countries pose an excellent opportunity to increase energy production in the country, and we believe that the Galapagos Agreement, which aims to export energy from Colombia to Chile through the Andean region, offers great opportunities for the local energy industry. Colombia's geostrategic location and its energy production capacity are key elements for the country to increase energy production levels, as well as to become a key player in the regional energy arena.</p><h4>What have been the main challenges in developing the Quimbo project?</h4><p>It is a large project in which social and environmental issues pose the greatest challenges. Therefore, we have always worked extremely closely with local communities and authorities, as well as regional and national governing bodies. However, there is a large opposition group that kept a strong position against this and other energy projects in the country. We believe it has misled the public with inaccurate information, because we have complied with all the compromises stipulated in the contract, always putting our greatest efforts into the environmental and social spheres of the project.</p><h4>What are Endesa's main investment plans for the near future?</h4><p>For the short term, we have an investment plan of about $180 million annually. In terms of projects, we are prioritizing the increase of electricity generation on the Bogotá River by 144 MW, which will cost over $43 million. We will also construct two sub-stations, Nueva Esperanza and Norte, at an estimated cost of $100 million. They will contribute to the consolidation of Bogotá's energy supply.</p><h4>What is your vision for the future of the energy sector in Colombia, and for Endesa's operations?</h4><p>The rules of the game have been pretty clear for the last 15 years; there are two fundamental laws, 142 and 143, which were passed in 1995 and 1996. They have been the key strategic plan for the development of the industry by establishing, among other things, tariff periods of five years. That stability in the sector allows companies to plan long-term investment projects. We believe that the sector will continue developing in the same way, and we have ongoing projects that will further consolidate our operations in Colombia. It is a very attractive country for investing in energy.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>
