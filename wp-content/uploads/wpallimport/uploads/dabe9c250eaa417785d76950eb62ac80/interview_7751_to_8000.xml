		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What factors have contributed to your growth over the years?</h4><p>Our company has been in the construction business for over 35 years, manufacturing asphalt membranes for water proofing systems. We started as a small business and are now one of the most prominent enterprises in modifying asphalt throughout Latin America. Our products are exported to markets beyond Ecuador, which has been one of the main factors behind our growth and involvement in international markets.</p><h4>What has been Imptek's strategy to sustain dominance of the Ecuadorian market?</h4><p>The foundation of this industry is quality. Our standards for quality are the reason the market prefers our products. This industry—specifically in Latin America—is a price-driven market, and it is difficult to sell on quality, despite our best efforts to orient the market toward a better quality proposition. That said, our prices and quality are both appreciated, which is a strategic benefit when selling our products to international markets.</p><div class="quote">“At the moment, the chief investment has concerned our new plant."</div><h4>How are you diversifying your product portfolio?</h4><p>We have implemented two major changes. As I mentioned, our initial product line was modified asphalt for waterproofing purposes, but a few years ago we began using the product for pavements, road construction and maintenance. All roads in Ecuador are now being improved, which has led to a new market, separate from the segment we initially entered. We are now also diversifying into heat and noise insulation.</p><h4>Has the government's investment in roads and highways affected your growth?</h4><p>At first, we were not dependent on state infrastructure projects, and in fact I would argue that it was our growth that influenced the development of infrastructure. The government began to use the asphalt we were promoting, instead of local unmodified product. Our asphalt also has a component that ensures elasticity, making it more resistant to damage. Highways sustain a considerable impact from vehicles and require asphalt with shape memory, which is why the government today is using our asphalt for all infrastructure, buildings and highways.</p><h4>In what other areas are you investing your resources?</h4><p>At the moment, the chief investment has concerned our new plant. We have relocated our infrastructure from a plant of 10,000 sqm to one of almost 50,000 sqm. Furthermore, we are planning to open the first Imptek beyond Ecuador in Colombia in mid-March if everything goes to plan. We have been exporting for 15 years, but this will mark the first time we establish ourselves as a known brand in another country.</p><h4>What is Imptek's export profile?</h4><p>We have been exporting our products from Mexico to Chile and the Pacific Coast. The international market represents 30% of our current total sales and we expect it to account for 50% within the next five years. Last year we saw a marked decrease in our sales to Colombia as the Colombian peso was devaluated to Ps2,400/dollar, as a result of which Colombia lacked the financial muscle to import products from Ecuador, or in fact anywhere but Europe. We faced aggressive competition from European products. Despite Ecuador's strategic geographic advantage concerning exports to Latin America, we still face high costs in transportation, especially over land, to Colombia and Peru. We are a solid provider, but have found ourselves encumbered by the macroeconomic environment nonetheless. Colombia is a much larger market than Ecuador, and should be our natural export destination. Our installed infrastructure demands that we look to bigger markets. We are currently at only 50% capacity at the new plant. We have a strategic plan to identify markets in the US, Mexico, and Brazil. We are always looking in America and hopefully one day also enter Asia. We made an effort to introduce our products in Spain, but there are many competitors of our pedigree already present in that market. If the euro rises up, we could potentially do business, however.</p><h4>What are Imptek's CSR initiatives?</h4><p>The cornerstone of our strategic model and for our business is our well-defined corporate culture, which stresses that every action we take has a reaction. We strongly believe that our growth has to be equal to that of the community.</p><h4>What is Imptek's goal for 2015?</h4><p>For 2015, our main goal is to produce at a minimum capacity utilization rate of 70% at our new plant. We have started out at 50%, and adding that 20% would enable a rise in sales of over 50%.</p><h4>What is the outlook for the industry over the next few years?</h4><p>That depends heavily on the political environment, although 2015 stands to be a quiet period. The government is not set to invest more in new construction, or extend credit to banks or individuals for real estate purchases. Next year is set to be one of election campaigning for 2017, which will doubtless see economic growth on government spending. External factors, however, such as the trajectory of oil prices will remain a question mark over economic performance.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the milestones of GE Capital Mexico since its establishment in 1993?</h4><p>In 1993 we entered the market through a joint venture. The first couple of years were spent learning how to do business in Mexico, and acclimatizing to the business environment. We established our own legal entity in 1995, and from then on brought GE Capital products directly to the market. Our first customers were in the Monterrey area, because we specialized in products that were rather new to the market, such as our financial or operating leases, and Monterrey is the most financially advanced city, and hence a logical point of departure. In 1997-98 we started introducing other GE Capital products, such as the fleet business, and in 1999 we brought our Corporate Air product. It was also around that time that GE Capital purchased Heller Capital; a factor also integrated into our local business in Mexico. It was from then on that we really started growing in Mexico. In 2007 we introduced our latest service, in the form of technology finance products. The year 2013 was our greatest milestone, registering revenues of $1 billion in Mexico.</p><h4>Which key drivers that led to this success?</h4><p>We are not bankers, but builders who partner with companies by understanding their challenges, offering products that add a unique value. For example, in our fleet services, while we offer the lease component, our customers can also take on the maintenance option. When a client wants to acquire a vehicle, we can offer them a comparison with other models and give them a tool called Total Cost of Ownership, whereby they get a complete view of how much owning a vehicle will cost them through the entire lifecycle of that product, including insurance, preventive maintenance, corrective maintenance, and so forth. We offer them a product that is tailor made to their needs.</p><div class="quote">“We are not bankers, but builders who partner with companies by understanding their challenges."</div><h4>You have a $3 billion portfolio of financial assets; how is it broken down?</h4><p>Around 50% of our portfolio is comprised of leases and loans. The rest is split between our products, fleet, technology finance, and working capital, etc. Of those products, the most profitable are those that have value added, such as our fleet services of strong operational intensity. Maintaining a fleet business where you take care of both financing and maintenance is labor intensive, but our customers are aware of its value and are willing to pay for it. Our Corporate Air services are also highly profitable, and we have customers like Aero Mexico, Interjet, and Volaris, and see marked growth potential in the segment. The commercial aviation services are taken care of from our site in Queretaro, which also oversees the energy and oil and gas business lines, with those products being supported globally.</p><h4>What are your views on Mexico's aerospace industry?</h4><p>In 2013, we immersed ourselves in that industry, which remains in its infancy. Companies like Bombardier and Rolls Royce already have assembly plants here, but the sector mostly deals with assembly, although there are some suppliers producing their own goods in Mexico. In this industry, there is little tolerance for variations in quality and manufacturing specifications. It takes time to develop suppliers capable of participating in this industry, and to attract suppliers to Mexico to construct their components here, rather than bringing those components here to be assembled. Yet we developed our automotive industry, and can repeat the performance with the aerospace business.</p><h4>SMEs are an exciting growth segment in Mexico. Which of your services most target SMEs?</h4><p>A number of services are of benefit, such as power generation equipment. We give them the opportunity to better finance this equipment and make rationalize the cost of electricity for companies, thereby helping them become more competitive on both a local and global scale. To give another example, our oil and gas business provides and finances equipment for drilling sensors; a service not financed by any bank. Many SMEs may not be able to access financial markets for such equipment, but we enable this. A third example is that we enable our customers to assign value to, and monetize, equipment, with which they can use the funds to expand or make new acquisitions. Therefore, we provide flexibility in terms of what the customer can monetize. As a result, we have been growing annually in the SME segment, from which about 50% of our revenues derived in 2013. Moreover, Mexico's new reforms will also spur competition, which will further expand the SME segment.</p><h4>What challenges have you found in financing SMEs in Mexico?</h4><p>Some companies have grown rapidly in that segment in the last few years, but they may still have a small company structure and managerial outlook, which can be a hindrance to commercial performance. Some companies can reach sales figures of $100 million, and remain managed by a single person. They need to adapt their managerial structures to growth, which would render them more conducive to doing business.</p><h4>Where do you see the company in Mexico in the next 10 years?</h4><p>We plan to continue expanding at slightly over the growth rate of the Mexican economy. We want to expand into construction equipment, and oil and gas services, and to sustain overall growth to propel ourselves to the next level in Mexico.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>To be sure, both global and domestic motives mark the sporting scene in the UAE. The global motive is a natural component of our global society. The UAE is a cosmopolitan destination and a global crossroads. People living and working in the UAE become global citizens—people whose scope of vision, understanding, and interest traverses national borders; people whose guiding values are more universal than provincial. And they all bring to our country the sports of their countries. The sports of the UAE are much more than just falconry and camel racing and skiing in the Dubai Mall.</p><p>Early in 2014, the government of India ruled that during the extended period for national elections, it could not provide security for the first 20 matches scheduled for the Indian Premier League (IPL). Thus, the IPL relocated the matches to our magnificent stadia in Abu Dhabi, Dubai, and Sharjah. Fans completely filled the stadiums for those 20 matches during the last 15 days of April. The sport, by the way, was cricket. We cherish the bridges that cricket has built between the international communities within the UAE. These bridges are a vital part of a complex crossing system that also features rugby, football, and basketball, and these sports bridge the gap for races of all kinds. They are representative of an extensive inventory of sporting bridges in the UAE, bridges crossed daily by our global population.</p><div class="quote">“To embrace sports is to embrace life."</div><p>Sports demand dedication, practice, coordination, balance, alertness, concentration, technique, judgment, discipline, patience, daring, civility, and teamwork. Those are also the attributes that strengthen individuals and increase their ability to make a positive difference in their communities. Our UAE leadership values those attributes. His Highness the President, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al-Nahayan, has said that our country “has relied, and will continue to rely, on the rich and diverse contributions of its true wealth, its people, to guarantee its prosperity." Our true wealth lies in people with the attributes that are also valued by the sports that appeal to our global population. Here in Abu Dhabi, His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al-Nahayan, the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, believes strongly in the value of sports to a well-developed society. His strong support of the variety of sports played in the UAE helps everyone in our country to enjoy the benefits of athletic competition in improving the quality of our lives and in advancing the values of peace and understanding, both domestically and globally.</p><p>In the UAE, you will notice that global motives intertwine with domestic motives in regard to our support of major international sporting events. We embrace sports because we hope to see UAE citizens as well as all of our residents from around the world participate in sports and reap the benefits for mind and body so generously offered by sports. Our children and our young men and women are our primary concern. If the Roman poet Ovid is right that “nothing is stronger than habit," then we must encourage our young people to develop in a safe way with the healthiest habits. The danger for them, and for our country's future, lies in their not developing those habits.</p><p>To embrace sports is to embrace life. I highly recommend it and wish for you all a wholly productive conference. Women as well as men can excel in the competition and achieve success. And that in appreciating achievement in the sports world, we honor the human spirit, the hard work, the endurance, and the focus that success requires.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>LAU has always invested heavily in innovation and technology. What major advances have been implemented in the past year?</h4><p>Universities are just as heavily affected by globalization and technological developments as any industry. As institutions of higher learning, we have had to adopt new technologies in order to provide our students with an education that is second to none. Bringing the fields of technology and education together is a challenge, but we have taken the lead by connecting all of our campuses, departments, and offices through dramatic innovation. We now have four campuses in Beirut, Byblos, the University Medical Center in east Beirut, and an academic center in New York. They are all connected through state-of-the-art technology. Our classrooms are all smart, interactive, and always connected to the internet. In addition to utilizing technology, our research in IT is ongoing. We are constantly innovating, especially when it comes to databases, data storage, and data availability and accessibility.</p><h4>What is the role of R&amp;D at LAU, and what are the most significant ongoing research projects?</h4><p>We take R&amp;D very seriously. In order to be a faculty member at LAU, you have to be involved not only in teaching, but also in research. The quality of our faculty and their research was made evident when LAU was ranked second in the region for research impact by Times Higher Education. Our priority is the learning process rather than the teaching process, whereby professors and students come together—facilitated by technology—to study, learn, and conduct research. For example, faculty and students in our School of Engineering are working on the development of a unique, unprecedented exoskeleton suit that will enable paralyzed people to maintain their balance and regain mobility. As a testament to our sense of family and community at LAU, a team of students and staff recently climbed Mount Kilimanjaro in order to raise funds for this innovative project. Further collaboration can be seen in the Schools of Medicine, Nursing, and Pharmacy, which are all working together with the doctors at our University Medical Center-Rizk Hospital, conducting research on coronary diseases with top notch cardiologists who are interested not only in theoretical research but in applying it to practice. The Hospital is a hub for the application of theories to practice and vice versa, enabling them to feed each other and strengthen the process of research. Research, technology, and innovation are an integral part of all our departments, and are accessible to our entire student body. A fundamental part of our methodology is the involvement of students in research so that they are immersed in technologies they can then use with ease when they become faculty members themselves.</p><div class="quote">“We take R&amp;D very seriously."</div><h4>How would you describe LAU's relation with the Lebanese business community?</h4><p>We have a multitude of examples showcasing the University's strong cooperation and collaboration with the business community. We have partnered with an industry leader to manufacture the exoskeletons, and we bring business practices into the classroom to ensure that our research is valuable and meets specific industry goals and needs. Many of our programs include internships at companies and organizations in Lebanon. Once our students graduate, we maintain contact with alumni and their employers to ensure that our programs are responding to societal needs, be it at an undergraduate or graduate level. We also bring business practices into the classroom in such a way that you have research that remains applied research, and research that meets specific and important goals and needs. One of the major areas of research at our School of Business currently focuses on family businesses, especially with regards to the problems those businesses are running into in terms of succession. Most businesses in Lebanon are family businesses, which don't as a rule consider succession, or don't want an independent and elected board. So we are doing a lot of research and holding many conferences in this area in order to respond to the needs of the Lebanese business community. We have also launched an LL.M. in business law that is unique to Lebanon and has attracted many business professionals seeking to expand their knowledge and acumen. Moving on to architecture and design, we connected with Elie Saab, one of the world's leading lights in fashion design. Our fashion degree program is unique, bringing us together with the London College of Fashion and an internationally acclaimed couturier. We are also proud of our impressive faculty of economic experts, who regularly appear on TV to discuss issues affecting the world, such as the effects of globalization in such areas as the movement of capital, employment, entrepreneurial funding, national interests in economic planning, and so on. Our School of Medicine has recently moved into a new state-of-the-art building on our campus at Byblos, and our faculty members and doctors are connecting with practitioners at the University Center Rizk-Hospital to see how they can research issues of use to the healthcare delivery system of Lebanon. In short, we can say that LAU is not an ivory tower; it is where the action is. We meet the needs of society, helping that society in turn meet the challenges of globalization.</p><h4>What importance does LAU give to international exchange programs?</h4><p>We have sent our students on exchange programs all over the world, and students from all over the globe are coming to our university in Lebanon and New York. Exchange programs are very important for us. We also have numerous joint research programs with other universities around the Mediterranean, many of which are funded by the European Community. Our School of Medicine has an agreement with Harvard Partners Medical International, and also with the University of Iowa, the University of Chicago, and the University of Illinois Medical School at Chicago, and we are seeking linkages with St. Jude's Hospital, which was established by Danny Thomas, a famous American of Lebanese origin. We are also exploring the possibility of association with the Miami Project, which is focused on the brain and seeking to cure paralysis. We have a strong network globally and a plethora of exchange programs and opportunities for students, faculty, and researchers.</p><h4>Lebanon's status as the educational capital of the Middle East is being challenged by ambitious projects in the Gulf region. What steps should be taken for Lebanon to retain this well-earned title?</h4><p>A lot is being done in this regard. Lebanon is prominent in terms of the quality of education it provides. There's a lot of competition here in terms of quality educational institutions, and that keeps us creative and innovative. As an American institution, we thrive on competition. At the same time, we have deep roots here, considering that we were established in 1835 as a school for the education of women during the Ottoman Empire, a time when Europe and the US were ignorant about the role and the rights of women in society. We are deeply rooted here, but with an American mindset, which makes us a formidable institution. The 21st century belongs to innovators. To stay ahead of the curve, it is not enough to simply provide students with an education; we have to be creative and innovative and demonstrate new ways of thinking and doing things. We are sure that competition will increase, and as a result so too will the level of education here. We are accredited by a leading agency, the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC), and our accreditation is on a par with institutions like Harvard, Yale, and all the Ivy League schools.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the strategic importance of the Saudi market in relation to Deutsche Bank Group's overall MENA strategy?</h4><p>Emerging markets in the overall context of Deutsche Bank's global business strategy are extremely important. Emerging markets obviously encompass many countries and regions, including Latin America, Asia, and the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). Within MENA, the GCC is a critical part. Saudi Arabia, being the largest economy in the GCC and one of the largest among emerging economies, has a special place within the overall strategy of the bank. With a GDP of nearly $950 billion, a youthful population of 28 million, a solid fiscal position with significant buffers (notwithstanding the recent slide in crude oil prices), a stable and well-managed monetary and banking system, and a vibrant private sector, Saudi Arabia is one of the most attractive markets among its emerging market peers as far as the Bank is concerned. This has been our view since establishing our presence in the Kingdom in 2006. And this is why we continue to invest in our Saudi platform. In addition to our well-established investment banking and corporate finance operation we invested heavily in a well-rounded corporate banking and transaction banking presence as well as in corporate treasury services. We are also growing our wealth management, custody, and brokerage business onshore.</p><h4>How does DSSA leverage Deutsche Bank's global reach to better serve its clients in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>DSSA, though operating as a segregated legal entity in compliance with Capital Market Authority (CMA) regulations, is owned 100% by Deutsche Bank. Through robust service level agreements and other arrangements with all relevant entities of Deutsche Bank Group around the globe, we are seamlessly integrated into its fabric. Therefore, our clients launching an IPO or a bond issue, for example, get the benefit of the best that Deutsche Bank has to offer globally from our product, structuring, industry and risk distribution, and management teams and systems. This is the bedrock of our business approach to Saudi clients; delivering the best advice, service, and products that the Bank can deliver anywhere in the world with no compromises. The Saudi-based team manages client interfaces and helps clients with local products and services; however, in the end, we rely on the infrastructure and the various divisions of the Bank's centers of excellence all over the world to deliver value to our Saudi-based clients.</p><div class="quote">“I believe our aspiration is well beyond accolades."</div><h4>How will the Saudi Stock Exchange's (Tadawul) further opening up to foreign investors affect DSSA?</h4><p>It is an important initiative for the Kingdom's securities market and for the CMA and Tadawul. DSSA has been a key player in this market since its inception in 2008 and we continue to have a prominent position. In terms of business, the opening of the market will generate a much larger amount of flows for our brokerage business and will grow the local custody business significantly. The amount of interest among our global clients is high. There are some concerns, however, and some questions and clarifications that I hope will be resolved and addressed in a proper way in time for that launch.</p><h4>How is DSSA developing local human capital in the finance sector?</h4><p>It is a well-established global policy for the Bank to do two things in every country we go into. The first is to develop the markets and help the regulators, exchanges, and key market players to actually make it broader, deeper, more efficient, and liquid. The second, which is just as important, if not more so, is to ensure that we hire, train, and develop local talent and human capital. That is critical for Deutsche Bank, and it is one of the reasons why we were successful, not just in the Kingdom but also in many other countries. If you look at our platform, we are about 60% Saudis, and our senior management are all Saudi. Developing technical expertise and ensuring that the right candidates float to the very top is an extremely important consideration for Deutsche Bank.</p><h4>What are your goals for the medium term?</h4><p>Obviously, we have our own business objectives, which are numbers based. Maybe what is more relevant is what we aspire to be in Saudi Arabia? We have always wanted to be the leading corporate, investment, and wealth management bank in Saudi Arabia, serving our public sector, corporate, and private wealth clients with the best advice, service, and products achievable anywhere in the world. We have won accolades and awards over the years; however, I believe our aspiration is well beyond accolades.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess 2014 for the BSE?</h4><p>Overall, 2014, especially its second half, was a very complicated period of time in the global and regional arena. Geopolitical and energy market volatility affected many regional economies and national currencies. The Azerbaijan capital market and the economy overall continue to demonstrate stability and resistance to negative external factors. For the Baku Stock Exchange, for instance, it was an outstanding year. Total trading volumes exceeded AZN13 billion, which is a record figure since BSE's inception in 2000. Another highlight was the launch of new private market initiated product lines. It is worth remembering here that, initially, BSE emerged during the privatization processes in the 1990s. A few joint-stock companies along with a brand new investor category sprang up in Azerbaijan as a result of two privatization programs adopted by the government at the time. Over the decade, the number of individual and corporate investors reached almost 100,000 and joint stock companies reached over 2,000. This eventually led to the inception of the BSE. At the initial stage of its development—until about 2008—the BSE was operating under the post-privatization framework. Government securities were responsible for almost 90% of all trading volumes. This period is now over. In 2014, the launch of new financial and capital market tools, such as classic securities, really stood out and marked the year. We also launched market makers supported corporate bonds trading and repo transactions with them, as well as started selling margin-based derivatives—currency and commodities derivatives—and we are currently working on launching foreign securities. This resulted in record figures and the BSE exceeded all the previous years' indicators. Despite the signs of a crisis in the global economy, we expect the BSE to thrive in 2015.</p><h4>To what extent is an increase in the BSE's turnover because of new products?</h4><p>New products contributed about 30% to total turnover. Additionally, it is necessary to acknowledge another figure. Traditionally, major government issuances of the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of Azerbaijan (CBA) government liabilities accounted for a significant share of the pre-final transactions segment of the BSE. In 2014, its amounts remained comparable to previous years but its share reduced significantly and dropped to less than 50%. It is a positive sign as the private sector is playing a more active role at the BSE.</p><div class="quote">“There is one special initiative that has just started, which is a listing advisory project."</div><h4>Corporate securities have increased significantly. What are the reasons behind that?</h4><p>Compared to the state liabilities, it is still moderate in terms of turnover; however, the growth dynamics are impressive. Over the past 18 months, the amount of corporate bonds in the local market has tripled. On the institutional side, the segment has become more complex as well. The legal and operational framework for both corporate repo and market makers' service was elaborated. Around 12 types of liabilities led to the development of the market makers' services, which, in turn, led to the liquidity of these tools and increased trade on the corporate securities side. The total volume of this trade has still not reached the level of government bonds; however, it is almost comparable now. Currently, Azerbaijani companies are mainly funded by their profits, the capital injections of their shareholders, and traditional bank loans tools. Still, capital markets are becoming more appealing to them. Awareness of new market instruments is rising, which is welcome news for us.</p><h4>How has the project to create derivatives with National Depository Centre (NDC) and InvestAz developed so far?</h4><p>By the middle of 2014, we had started trading currency-based derivatives, and commodities-based derivatives were launched in 3Q2014. We are now considering foreign securities-based derivatives. The market has been developing actively; the share of derivatives reached about 25% of the total trading volume of the BSE quickly. NDC is carrying out a post-trading clearing settlement on these transactions. InvestAz is acting as the primary liquidity provider. We aim to develop this market. At the moment, the State Committee for Securities of Azerbaijan (SCS) is developing the legal framework for both mediatory services and margin-based derivatives trading market regulations. This comes down to the drafts of the law for the securities market that is now being finalized and will be submitted for the Parliament's approval later in 2015. We believe that this will boost the development of this particular segment. It is a successful on-going project, and we hope to attract different liquidity providers. The depth and liquidity of this market will increase. The aim of BSE, SCS, and NDC is to provide maximum protection of the participants' interests from systemic and particular risks in this segment.</p><h4>What is the process required for foreign investors to work with the BSE?</h4><p>There are no limits for foreign investors to participate in transactions at the BSE securities market in terms of taxes and regulations regarding non-residents' capitals registration and profits repatriation. The NDC is carrying out all of the associated duties regarding non-resident registration. In this sense, the process is as easy for a foreigner as it is for domestic investors. It is enough to choose a broker and a bank to join the market. The preparation will take about five days for non-residents. After opening the relevant accounts at the depositary center, choosing a broker and signing the contracts, a foreign investor can start trading at the securities market. The participation of foreign investors at the capital market is quite liberalized.</p><h4>The state program for the development of capital markets that was started in 2011 is going on to 2020. How successful has it been so far in streamlining capital markets?</h4><p>This program is quite elaborate, and comprises legal, administrative, and technological advancement of all the securities market institutions, and embraces an entire decade. To support the program, Azerbaijan signed a credit agreement for the capital market's modernization project with the World Bank. The agreement covers five out of 10 ten years allocated for this state program and comprises such significant sub-projects as the legal framework consolidation and creating a capital market law to place the legislation in line with that of Europe. It also implies revitalization of the operational base of BSE and the NDC. We have just completed one of the tenders within the state program—a contract for purchase and installation of the unified electronic trading and post-trading securities market platform—and all the documents have already been signed. This ambitious project will be realized over 2015 with the Korean Stock Exchange. It will allow us to streamline and optimize transactions and will broaden the horizons for our brokers.</p><h4>Are there any new initiatives or projects that are being developed at the moment?</h4><p>There is one special initiative that has just started, which is a listing advisory project. BSE targets local issuers and investors. It is a project to promote and support the development of local market leaders and investors to raise their awareness on IPO listings. We managed to put together the leading audit, brokerage, and legal companies operating in Azerbaijan within the project's framework. They agreed to provide advisory services to local companies over the transition period to become a joint-stock company and to participate at the IPO later on free of charge. Any company that signs an MoU with the BSE can expect complimentary support to be provided, such as brokers, auditors, and legal advisors. In a different country and under different circumstances, such support would require allocating massive funds. We are grateful to our partners and are planning to provide assistance to 20 companies initially. If the project proves to be effective, it will be extended in 2016.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Where is Global Building Contract (GBC) positioned in the Kazakhstani market?</h4><p>The Kazakh market is highly competitive and segmented. GBC operates in the residential segment of the local Almaty market, where we have around a 40% share of the primary market. The percentage of primary deals is about 15-20%. GBC positions itself as a developer. We estimate projects mainly in terms of investment attractiveness. As for the real estate market, GBC positions itself as a company that develops all the residential market segments, including comfort class, business, and high-end. We have all sorts of properties in our portfolio.</p><h4>The company was recently awarded for its remarkable performance and its high-quality buildings. How could it turn into a major player in Kazakhstan's real estate segment?</h4><p>We didn't expect to receive these awards because we are quite a new company and we are not actively promoting ourselves. The awards were the result of a survey where the majority of the respondents mentioned GBC as a fast-growing company. The company restarted some of the projects that were stopped, and there were some social projects among them. At the time, it was important to complete them because there were a lot of people waiting for their apartments. We have been active in developing all segments of the real estate business, from comfort to high-end projects. In four to five years, the company has established a solid reputation and managed to put up a great deal of real estate in the city. I believe there is one crucial thing that has greatly contributed to the company's success. Since the very first day, we were crystal clear about GBC's positioning in the market. We positioned ourselves as a developer not a construction company. This has allowed us to mobilize the talent and succeed as a team. We create and supply, rather than build and construct. This is the cornerstone of our business philosophy.</p><div class="quote">“We apply our financial background in several ways."</div><h4>How is your network of financial partners supporting GBC in its operations?</h4><p>We apply our financial background in several ways. We work in the real estate market and that requires having not only financial, but also a real economy background. We have quite a few advantages. First, we have managed to streamline the decision-making process. I see many companies using GBC as a model. We had the chance to work with leading financing institutions such as banks, Kazkommertsbank (KKB) in particular. Secondly, we have managed to avoid over-complicated business processing. And thirdly, we have managed to mobilize talent: our team combines professionals working in GBC, as well as architects and designers. In terms of architecture, we have taken a market-oriented approach. We could see that the market could not consume the products available before the downturn. We've put marketing and sales first. We focused on creating a result-oriented sales team and managed to get some of the most experienced professionals and put them to work with very enthusiastic newcomers to the profession. We don't use aggressive marketing to make people purchase what they don't really need. Instead, we analyze the market and meet the existing demand. That is what distinguishes us from our competitors. The relocation of the capital city from Almaty to Astana is one of the major forces driving the real estate segment.</p><h4>How is the company taking advantage of the booming construction sector in the capital?</h4><p>Astana is a fast-growing city and is one of our target markets—it is in our strategic development plan. We have a very good understanding of how the local Almaty market works. We keep an eye on the contractors and major players and we know how to develop business relationships and business processes here. Expansion for the sake of it is not what we're looking for. It is essential to know the market properly to come up with a good product or service. Obviously, premature expansion makes doing business more complicated. I can't tell you the exact date when we will enter Astana's market, but we are definitely going to operate there at some point. Another factor that requires consideration is the market segment we will operate in for Astana. As for Almaty, the market volume is as great as in Astana. However, given that there are 1.5 million people living in Almaty, and 800,000 to 850,000 people living in Astana, the demand is not the same in terms of quantity. Nevertheless, Almaty's market is very saturated, whereas the demand for housing and so the prices have been growing much faster in Astana. To date, the prices in Almaty and Astana are more or less the same. It is possible that the prices have actually reached their upper limit, meaning further development in Astana is going to be more complicated. It is essential to have a very solid offer to enter Astana's market and hence we are not rushing in. It is a question of timing. The new capital keeps growing and there is a great deal happening in Astana's residential and commercial segments because of Expo 2017. We work closely with our peers in Astana despite the fact that we are actually competitors. President Nazarbayev recently participated in the 10th World Islamic Economic Forum (WIEF) in Dubai, and Almaty, as well as Kazakhstan in general, received a lot of publicity in the newspapers. We do believe that Almaty will become a financial hub for several reasons. Firstly, this is what the President wants to make out of it. Secondly, the development of ecotourism is big in Kazakhstan, and Almaty is quite popular with tourists. And thirdly, Almaty is an educational hub already.</p><h4>The Green Building Council (KazGBC) plans to focus on the development of sustainable buildings in Kazakhstan. How is GBC aligned with this approach?</h4><p>One of KazGBC's key objectives is to define the exact areas for the development of green technologies. Obviously, construction and development is a vital part of this program. At the moment, there is no accurate benchmark or clear criteria in terms of residential construction. We are now at the discussion stage to define what green construction and architecture is, how it will affect costs, and what products and services are already in the market to pay for it. Profitability is certainly a crucial point for green construction. There is a certain philosophy behind green technologies. In my opinion, environmental issues in Kazakhstan are not quite at the significant level at the moment, as we are not fully integrated into the global economy. Considering the natural resources available in the country, its vast territory, and relatively small population, Kazakhstan is not facing any acute environmental problems. The country is a member of the Kyoto Protocol. Since the country is trying to attract more foreign investment, we have to play by the rules. The rules regarding green technologies are rather concise; traditionally, the standards used are the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) guidelines. Here we are looking for useful and practical decisions in terms of green technologies. We're seeking to make the international standards more applicable to the country. There are several projects in Astana, including those of Expo 2017, which are certified according to LEED guidelines. However, this does not imply a tradition or a trend in the market.</p><h4>What is GBC's business outlook for the short term and its mid-range goals?</h4><p>We're part of a huge construction sector that employs over 800,000 people here in Kazakhstan. At this stage, it needs a breath of fresh air in terms of human resources and training for people who work in project and facility management. Funding investment is, obviously, the biggest issue. There are questions about which directions should be developed and how they should be developed. I believe that we, as a country and as a sector, will have plenty of opportunities to develop. My goal is to be in the residential real estate market for as long as possible. However, the commercial and industrial segments of the real estate market are our mid- and long-term objectives. The real estate and construction sector is directly and substantially supported by President Nazarbayev. Nevertheless, the sector needs to become more investment attractive, and those investors will need strong local partners. There are two ways for GBC to be a strong partner: first, we can offer good, solid projects that demonstrate our knowledge of the market, offer a full package, and show our expertise; second, we can continue to be a local investor. In that role, it is essential to achieve financial transparency and to be a reliable partner.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

The UAE is also vital for our energy security as it has been our number-one import source of crude oil for many years now. Beyond the macro-level, I think that the people-to-people relations between both countries are actually very close. Many Emiratis have visited Thailand as tourists, many among them medical tourists, and they have a good impression of my country and its people. On the other hand, there are currently about 10,000 Thai nationals residing in the UAE and working in various sectors, ranging from heavy industry and infrastructure to the hospitality sector and the airline business; Thai people are contributing to the growth and prosperity of the UAE as well.</p><h4>The UAE is Thailand's primary trade partner in the region. How has the volume of bilateral trade developed over the years and in what ways is the UAE a hub for Thai trade to the Middle East?</h4><p>The UAE is not only our primary trade partner in the Middle East, but was our fifth largest trading partner worldwide in 2013, with a trade volume exceeding $20 billion for the first time in history. Both our exports to and imports from the UAE have risen continuously over many years, although for 2014 Thai imports from the UAE may decline for the first time. However, there is no cause for concern as this drop is mainly due to the falling average price of crude oil, which dominates our imports from the UAE. The UAE is a perfect hub for Thai trade to the Middle East because of its highly developed infrastructure, both physical and digital, its excellent connectivity to other parts of the world, and also its enabling trade and economic policy. This is best illustrated by the fact that the only Thai Trade Centre, which is the government export promotion agency, in the Middle East is based in Dubai. A number of large Thai companies such as PTT, Siam Cement Group (SCG), and Charoen Pokphand Foods (CPF) also have a representative office in Dubai, which cover not only the Middle East region, but also Africa in some cases. With the opening of Khalifa Port, the construction of the Midfield Terminal at the Abu Dhabi International Airport, as well as many other big, exciting projects, Abu Dhabi will certainly gain significance as another trade hub in the Middle East in the medium-term too.</p><div class="quote">“The UAE is not only our primary trade partner in the Middle East, but was our fifth largest trading partner worldwide in 2013."</div><h4>What opportunities exist for the UAE's private-sector investment in Thailand?</h4><p>Foreign investment opportunities exist across all sectors in Thailand. We have an investment-friendly economic policy, a highly skilled workforce, reasonably well-developed infrastructure, and a favorable geographical location. These factors will be boosted even further by the establishment of the ASEAN Economic Community in 2015 when the 10 Southeast Asian nations become a single market and production base with free flow of goods, labor, and capital—and Thailand is right in the heart of it. In the coming years, there will be numerous investment opportunities in the logistics industry and related sectors, especially in the transportation infrastructure area, following the recent approval of the infrastructure development plan for 2015-22, which targets the improvement and expansion of the provincial rail network, highways, a sea port, and public transport in Bangkok. For the very short term, UAE oil firms might be interested in the coming petroleum concession bidding round, which is the first petroleum concession in Thailand since 2007. The Thai Board of Investment (BOI) also just approved the Seven-Year Investment Strategy for 2015-21, with a view to promote investments that create value for Thailand and those that have positive impact on the society and environment. Special incentives will be given to investments in, for example, high-tech and creative industries, the digital economy, projects located in 20 lower-income provinces, as well as the five special economic development zones in the border areas. In this regard, I would encourage potential investors to study this strategy in order to optimize their investment decisions. Moreover, the new investment promotion package also encourages the establishment of the International Headquarters (IHQ) and International Trade Center (ITC) in Thailand. IHQs and ITCs will enjoy various benefits including tax privileges; for instance, tax-free income from dividends and capital gains from overseas investment, tax-free income received from providing services to subsidiaries, and tax-free profit from trading products purchased from foreign sources and sold to foreign destinations. Additionally, the personal income tax on expatriate staff of IHQs and ITCs is reduced to 15%, which is half of the normal rate. Foreign companies that have production units in Thailand as well as in neighboring countries can establish their regional headquarters in Thailand and enjoy such benefits under the IHQ scheme. Foreign trading companies without production units can also apply for ITC privileges and carry out their out-out trading activities from trading bases in Thailand without any tax burden. These special privileges for IHQs and ITCs will soon turn Thailand into a global trading hub in the very near future contributing to even higher growth in the service sector, intra-ASEAN trade, as well as trade between ASEAN and countries outside the region.</p><h4>How do you see the two countries further strengthening ties in the near future?</h4><p>Naturally I would like to see bilateral ties strengthened in all areas because this is what my colleagues in Bangkok and in the UAE are working hard to achieve. I have no doubt that our economic relations will grow further as both our countries are open economies with complementary characteristics but tremendous potential, especially the UAE with the prospect of hosting the World Expo 2020. Thailand and the UAE have agreed to establish a Joint Commission (JC) as the forum to drive forward our collaboration in all dimensions, and I sincerely hope that we can organize the first JC meeting some time in 2015. This would be very timely, as it will coincide with the 40th anniversary of Thai-UAE diplomatic relations. Lastly, I hope that the people-to-people ties will remain as strong as they are, if not become even stronger.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you talk about your main policies since assuming office three years ago?</h4><p>We have had an economic model in place since this administration took office under the mandate of Governor Jose Calzada Rovirosa, the main focus of which is the welfare of the people of Querétaro. To achieve this aim we have a strategy based on three pillars. The first is the attraction of investment, both local and foreign. The second is support for local SMEs and companies in general. And the third, which is a challenge that must be addressed in Mexico, is the development of poorer regions in the State and the provision of opportunities for all citizens within it. Just as Mexico overall has a range of economic levels, so too does Querétaro, and there is a need to bring economic opportunities and employment to the poorer people of those regions.</p><h4>What strategies have you taken to attract FDI into Queretaro?</h4><p>In general, in terms of FDI in recent years, Querétaro has been considered an important destination, especially during the past six years in terms of security among the various regions of Mexico. FDI started to move from the north of the country to the center, and in that sense Querétaro is a leader in FDI in Central Mexico. We are focused on the four main areas of aerospace, automotive, IT, and biotechnology. This marks the second step of what we began with the food and beverage industry 60 years ago, and companies are moving toward biotechnology, instead of merely the agricultural industry. FDI in Querétaro rose from $200 million a year in 2009 to almost $900 million in 2013, and in 2015 will have risen to around $2 billion. To a certain extent Querétaro has become a focus for FDI partly because of Mexico's wider reality, in terms of security. Furthermore, we have worked on increasing the number of highly skilled workers in the state. We have become a hub for certain industries such as aerospace, biotechnology, and automotive. Additionally, we have pursued programs to support companies in hiring talented people, by training people at our schools, especially our public schools, at different levels, from basic to highly skilled technicians and engineers, with success in many sectors.</p><div class="quote">“The train will bring us closer to Mexico City as people will be able to work here and live in the capital."</div><h4>Querétaro has been largely praised as a solid address for FDI because of its central location. What will be the importance of the high-speed train between Mexico City and Querétaro for the development of the state?</h4><p>The train will bring us closer to Mexico City as people will be able to work here and live in the capital. Furthermore, many corporates could establish their headquarters in Querétaro and travel back and forth to the capital when required. The state of Querétaro is moving from a labor-intensive economy to a capital intensive one, which means that we have more companies generating more investment, and in turn reducing unemployment. In that regard the train represents an excellent opportunity to expedite the process.</p><h4>Can you talk about your programs and initiatives for developing SMEs in the state?</h4><p>We have two or three strategies. First is the system to link SMEs with large companies, which is a development program for suppliers that we discuss with industry. Secondly, we have established a fund in Querétaro to support SMEs with credit and provide companies that are unable take out loans from commercial banks, whereby we assume the risk. So far we have provided around $340 million in financial support over the past five years, and have supported close to 3,000 companies. We provide them with loans at highly competitive rates of 6% per annum, in stark contrast to the commercial rate of around 14%. Meanwhile, we have established several business incubators to motivate the young population to become entrepreneurs and provide jobs for the state. In fact Querétaro is the only Mexican state to have a Ministry of Youth. This institution is orientated to support young Queretarans starting new companies. The Ministry of Youth has a budget of around Ps700 million to support such programs. We create around 6,000 new companies annually in Querétaro, large, small, medium, and micro, and plan to create around 32,000 jobs per year.</p><h4>What is your economic outlook for Querétaro for the next five years?</h4><p>I expect Querétaro to sustain its growth level. While a small state, we have developed a local model for annual growth and have a good business-minded community, focused on doing business and not politics, and I think that Querétaro has done a tremendous job over the past 20 years. Many people are migrating to the state, which is putting considerable pressure on regional growth in terms of the city, public services, and also in terms of job generation. Yet it will continue to grow and set an example for Mexico as a destination for profitable investment.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you talk about the strategy of concessions in Paita and how you meet related challenges?</h4><p>Paita was one of the concessions that we developed six years ago, having been successful at the tender for the 30-year concession, and we already have five years of experience in managing it. We expect the port to experience growth in the future, and will work to facilitate this under the terms of concession granted to us. Northern Peru has considerable potential, and is of great interest to us.</p><h4>What is your growth strategy for 2015, especially in terms of infrastructure?</h4><p>Concessions are a part of our development strategy, but we are not focused on the concession alone, but on the entire project by following a construction scheme. Concessions are a source of secure jobs, but we also work with private initiatives, because government schemes provide the advantage of participation in a co-financing project.</p><div class="quote">“Concessions are a part of our development strategy."</div><h4>Is co-financing an important part of your strategy?</h4><p>Definitely, and we are exploring the market potential of projects available for us to participate in. We have participated in the construction of the Airport of Chincheros in Cusco, but unfortunately we ended up in second place, as another company made a more aggressive offer that was difficult to compete with.</p><h4>In 2014 the state was working to promote foreign investment. It is true to say that in 2015 there will be more state-led infrastructure investment?</h4><p>Yes, there are highly ambitious projects at present; a key announcement was recently made regarding the construction of new roads. There is considerable interest in water, and waste disposal works, in which we are not currently participating. In terms of roads and infrastructure, Lima and other large cities require considerable improvement to keep traffic flowing and avoid resource mismanagement, which the government is set to address. Meanwhile, we will be constructing a hospital in Puno that will be financed from state coffers.</p><h4>Do you expect the economy to improve in 2015?</h4><p>We are all expecting the country to experience sustainable improvement. 2014 was a complicated year with a number of difficulties, and yet 2015 needs to be one of development, where growth should not register short of 5%.</p><h4>We have observed mining companies investing again in 2015 and note that you too are working on mining projects. What do you foresee for this sector in 2015?</h4><p>There are many important projects likely to commence in 2015 that could help the country develop and grow over the coming years. Yet these will depend on the degree of investor confidence in the state. I would also hope to see a continuation of such ongoing project investments as Torromocho with Chinalco, Lagunas Norte with Barrick, and an expansion project with Antamina. We are also working on Las Bambas, which will start production early in 2016.</p><h4>What is your goal for 2015 in terms of growth and revenue?</h4><p>Mota-Engil Peru has seen considerable growth over the past five years. Our position for 2015 is to see margins that enable us to sustain our position, without prioritizing sales. We will focus on mining, infrastructure, and certain energy projects, and will develop hydroelectric projects, one of which is due to commence this year, namely our Marañon hydroelectric project, which we will construct.</p><h4>How would you describe your relationship with the government of Peru in terms of investment and bureaucracy when compared with other countries in the region?</h4><p>We are not particularly dependent on public projects; the paperwork can be complicated, although we have not actually experienced much difficulty to date. The public sector in Peru is active and does provide scope for development, and yet this is even more so the case for the private sector, which we rely on to a greater extent.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of Dubai Customs' recent achievements?</h4><p>Dubai Customs has sought to continually improve its business performance across all areas of customs work to serve the country's economy through further trade facilitation. To that end, we have improved our personnel capacities and put in place the latest technologies and systems that expedite processes while securing the community against the entry of prohibited substances. The UAE was ranked third worldwide and first in the MENA region in the Efficiency of Customs Procedures Index from the latest Global Competitiveness Report 2014-2015 issued by the World Economic Forum. This is an important recognition for us which adds to many other local, national and international excellence accolades to our name. In 2014, DC achieved high satisfaction scores among our customers (91.2%), employees (86%), suppliers (84%), partners (86%), and above all the community (90%). These encouraging satisfaction figures are the result of our longstanding commitment to spreading happiness among all our stakeholders, in line with the vision and “Happiness Meter" initiative of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai.</p><h4>What role has Dubai Customs played as a trade facilitator?<br></h4><p>The efficient customs facilitation provided by Dubai Customs has supported the growth of Dubai's foreign trade with all parts of the world. Dubai has become a hotspot of international trade due to the efficiency of customs services and advanced logistics infrastructure, which brings traders and investors who choose Dubai as their favorite destination real added value and increasing business returns. Subsequently, over the last decade, Dubai's foreign trade has experienced a five-time growth from AED252 billion in 2003 to 1.331 trillion in 2014.<br></p><h4>How is the integration of Dubai Customs into the 2015 GCC Customs Union progressing?</h4><p>Dubai Customs has kept pace with the ongoing advancement on the path to full implementation of the GCC Customs Union by 2015, by rigorously applying all relevant resolutions and legislation and reinforcing its relationships with Customs authorities in Gulf countries toward the removal of all barriers to a prosperous inter-regional trade.</p><h4>How does Dubai Customs utilize technology to continue to be a worldwide leader in its field?<br></h4><p>Dubai Customs has never ceased investing in technology development and innovation, as we believe it is the only way we can continue carrying out our mission efficiently as a cross-border trade facilitator and protector of society. Some of the major innovations made by DC in the past few years include the "Mirsal 2" system, which stands as a quantum leap in customs work today because of the huge potential and new technologies it utilizes, as well as its unique integration of various customs procedures in one single electronic platform, in addition to the “Risk Engine" tool, and the advanced x-ray container scanning system and device. This strong base of technology earned our customs practices and business processes world-class recognition, including an international commendation by the 2013 WCO Columbus Diagnostic Mission Report, which praised our experience as a leading model for other Customs Administrations worldwide.<br></p><h4>What challenges does Dubai Customs face going into the future?</h4><p>We face mega challenges; however, we tend to turn them into opportunities. Striking the right balance between effective control measures and customs compliance on the one hand, and trade facilitation on the other hand, is the foremost challenge we face, as it is linked to Dubai Customs' fundamental mission of sustaining economic development through compliance, facilitation, and security enforcement.</p><h4>What initiatives are being put in place for World Expo 2020?</h4><p>We are committed to deliver a perfect and extraordinary exhibition experience to the world, by putting in place superior customs services and facilitations for the mega exposition, including the launch of a smart channel dedicated especially for potential exhibitors to streamline and expedite cargo clearance through a 24/7 automated customs clearance system. In addition, exhibitors can benefit from the pre-clearance feature prior to the actual arrival of goods. Dubai Customs will offer further facilitations to Expo 2020, including temporary admission of goods using ATA Carnet System, Authorised Economic Operator (AEO) program, the B2G integrated electronic channel for clearing several consignments in a single transaction, e-Freight for an automated exchange of air fright documents, alongside other facilitation systems, such as e-Inspection, Cargo Reconciliation, and Claim and Refund e-Services.</p><h4>What does the future hold for Dubai Customs in 2015 and beyond?</h4><p>Dubai Customs' future goals are determined based on UAE Vision 2021 and Dubai Plan 2021. Our strategic plan is in line with the directives of His Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, UAE President, to mark the year 2015 as the “Year of Innovation" in the country in order to stimulate creativity and mobilize resources across all sectors, further placing the UAE among the leading nations worldwide in terms of innovation. Dubai Customs views this nationwide move with utmost attention in pursuance of its strategic vision—to be the leading customs administration in the world supporting legitimate trade. Studied plans are put in place to unleash the spirit of innovation and creativity amongst DC employees. This helps reinforce customs processes with new innovations to boost DC's performance and therefore the UAE's economic growth. Dubai Customs recognizes that the future perspective focuses on four main themes: development of human capital, technology, knowledge, and security. If we can continue being a global leader in these four categories, Dubai Customs will do the same.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What factors lie behind BLOM's success and what have been the major milestones for the bank over 2014?</h4><p>Between 2007 and 2014, assets grew at a CAGR of 7.8% to reach $27.98 billion, and lending grew at 14.6% to reach $6.91 billion. We have also been remarkably profitable—profits grew during the same period at 8.4% to settle at $365.38 million; in addition, we have maintained a high ROAE, which stood at 15.8% at the end of 2014. It is noteworthy that this was all accomplished during the global financial crisis, the Arab Spring, and the ongoing instability in Lebanon. One of the main accomplishments in 2014 was our investment in the three “knowledge economy" funds—Impact, Leap Investment I, and Berytech II—as part of Banque du Liban's (BdL) directive 331. We also established a joint credit card with Beirut Traders' Association (BTA) for small- and medium-sized traders, reaching more than 700 members so far in the prime shopping malls and zones of the country. Lastly, entry into the promising Iraqi market by opening a branch each in Baghdad and Erbil was a big achievement for us last year.</p><h4>What steps is BLOM Bank taking to maintain its market share, and how does this strategy differ between markets?</h4><p>We are constantly working on not just maintaining our market share but increasing it. We are the leading bank in Lebanon for retail lending—our retail lending increased between 2007 and 2014 at a CAGR of 24.9% to reach $2.7 billion—and we are at the forefront of introducing new products and services. In Jordan, we run a very successful retail operation, enjoying the highest growth rate in the banking sector there. In Egypt, we have solid business in retail, corporate, trade financing, and asset management; and we have just established a company to run our expanding Egyptian asset management services. In Saudi, our investment banking operation is very dynamic, and we have currently the fastest growing business in real estate funds. In the UAE, our trade finance and corporate activities are doing well and expanding, and in Qatar and Europe, we are working diligently to enhance our corporate and private banking operations.</p><div class="quote">“We are constantly working on not just maintaining our market share but increasing it."</div><h4>What role does technology play at BLOM Bank and what innovative solutions have been recently implemented?</h4><p>Technology gives banks a competitive edge in delivering accessible and up-to-date products. We have the unique e-Cash service that allows our customers to send money from anywhere in the world to individuals who can cash it at our ATM machines and do not have to be our clients. Our POS machines are also able to converting payments into the currency of their choice. All our tech-based services are highly secured and come with the utmost protection.</p><h4>What are BLOM Bank's future investment plans?</h4><p>BLOM's short- and long-term investment plans are always designed to maintain the strength of our balance sheet and the sustainability of our profits. Our major investments are: Cash and Central Bank 36.9%; Loans 25.3%; Securities 25.1%; and interbank 10.1%. And as I mentioned earlier, BLOM participated in BdL's directive 331 initiative, investing $30 million in start-up funds to help shore up the “knowledge economy" sector in the country.</p><h4>How has Islamic banking evolved in Lebanon over the past years and what was BLOM Development Bank's role in its development?</h4><p>Islamic banking remains a niche market in Lebanon mainly due to the predominance of conventional banking and the cultural and religious diversity of the country. BLOM Development Bank (BDB) has done fairly well in this limited market, experiencing double-digit growth rates in the past few years. BDB was the first Islamic bank in Lebanon to undertake Sharia-compliant short- and long-term placements with BdL. It has launched debit cards and e-banking services, and was selected by The Banker as the “Best Islamic Bank in Lebanon for 2013."</p><h4>What is your assessment of Beirut's potential to regain the role of a major banking center in the region?</h4><p>Lebanon successfully played that role until the 1975 civil war, and the frequent skirmishes that followed since its culmination in 1990 have further weakened the position, especially considering the emergence of markets in Dubai and Bahrain. Lebanon could now develop as a center for the Arab Eastern Mediterranean region and Lebanese banks would play an increasingly influential role in the region as a whole.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What benefits will the first European Games provide for Azerbaijan in both economic and social terms?</h4><p>The First European Games will bring new experiences, advanced technologies, know-how, and innovative ideas, as well as improved benchmarks for future development. The standards achieved will have to supersede previous ones to meet more sophisticated requirements in the future, and, to maintain sustainability, new investments will have to be allocated in partnership with the private sector. These projects will also give birth to new spin-offs in other sectors and create numerous jobs. The country will offer world-class venues and services to host international events. According to a recent study by a UK-based construction consultancy firm, projects with clearly defined objectives and performance requirements contribute to universal economic and social benefits.</p><h4>What have been some of the most important achievements for AIC in 2014?</h4><p>With the overall value of our projects currently standing at over $1.1 billion, the integration of new technologies, modernization, innovation, and competitiveness, as well as the development of the capital markets, are among AIC's priority objectives. Overall, 2014 has been particularly good for AIC. Baku Shipyard, a half billion-dollar project, jointly owned by SOCAR, AIC, and Keppel Offshore and Marine, has evolved into the largest and most advanced facility of its kind in the Caspian Sea basin, with three multi-million-dollar contracts secured since its inauguration in 2013. Under these contracts, with a total value circa $450 million, the shipyard is undertaking the construction of two floating pontoons, a subsea construction vessel, and three 80-seat crew vessels. Another project is with Holcim (Azerbaijan), which produces high quality clinker and cement that is widely used in large-scale construction works and the implementation of energy projects. A standout investment outside of the non-oil industry we have made is with Saba Group. It is involved in all stages of food manufacturing and processing, from production of raw ingredients to the delivery of finished products. It is one of the major poultry products suppliers currently producing over 13,000 tons of poultry per year and 150 tons of dairy products on a daily basis. Well over 1,000 people work for Saba Group companies across the country. AIC's investment of approximately $15 million has helped the company to diversify its production, and expand into a new area of operations. Saba Group recently acquired 4,800 hectares of land, and launched Garabagh Wheat Ltd, the first privately owned pilot cereal crops company in the country. By using the most advanced PIVOT-irrigation system, it has reduced its water consumption and achieved successful harvesting of wheat and corn with average yields of 5.3-5.5 tons per hectare and over 10 tons per hectare, respectively.</p><h4>The majority of FDI is still focused on Azerbaijan's energy sector. Which areas of Azerbaijan's non-oil sector have the most investment potential in 2015?</h4><p>The project Azerbaijan 2020: Vision into the Future sets out some strategic targets including to double GDP per capita to $13,000 (in 2013 it was $7,912), and increase non-oil exports to $1,000 per capita (in 2013 the figure was $200) by 2020. The project also aims to achieve higher standards of living and lower poverty levels through government investment in education, healthcare and cultural, and social institutions. It may be surprising for some to learn that the non-oil sector has become the driving force for economic development and sustainable growth. The growth rate of the non-oil sector was 7% in 2014 and made up 61% of GDP. It is also quickly gathering momentum in terms of attracting investment. We welcome international businesses and have established a liberal investment climate with few restrictions. Azerbaijan is a party to major international investment agreements and has signed 47 bilateral investment treaties and 44 double taxation treaties. Over $172 billion has been invested in Azerbaijan in the last 10 years, nearly $84 billion of which constitute FDI. The FDI share in the non-oil sector has exceeded $35 billion, with the bulk of overall FDI placed within the industry sector making up 56.2% ($4.133 billion), followed by construction and production of construction materials on 15.7% ($1.15 billion), services on 13.1% ($963 million), and transport on 9.7% ($716 million). AIC has prioritized areas that coincide with sectors targeted by the government. Non-oil industry, agriculture, tourism, logistics, and ICT are among the most promising sectors of the economy.</p><div class="quote">“The project Azerbaijan 2020: Vision into the Future sets out some strategic targets."</div><h4>The first Business Forum Brussels-Azerbaijan took place in September 2014. What role did AIC play in this event and what opportunities in Azerbaijan did it highlight?</h4><p>The importance of such forums cannot be underestimated. Many of Azerbaijan's outstanding achievements speak for themselves, and our role at such events is to present these achievements to a wider audience, as well as invite potential investors to join in the success of the country. In recent years, our economy has been growing at one of the highest rates in the world, and today it is the largest in the South Caucasus region making up 75% of overall GDP. Azerbaijan has introduced one of the simplest business registration procedures in the world. Our fully digitalized taxation system is quite competitive. Moreover, most public authorities offer over 450 informative electronic services to the populace and business community. It is no wonder that the Doing Business Report by the World Bank graded Azerbaijan the top reformer of business regulations worldwide in 2009. Azerbaijan is one of the global frontrunners in terms of ease of business regulations since 2005.</p><h4>In what ways has AIC contributed to the Year of Industry in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Since October 2014, AIC has organized and managed the operations of industrial estates, and designated industrial compounds where SMEs are provided with the necessary opportunities and infrastructure to produce goods and services. On December 15, AIC signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the US-based SouthWest NanoTechnologies, Inc. (SWeNT), to start a long-term cooperation in the mass production of Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) in Azerbaijan. The project will be located at Sumgait Chemical Industrial Park and initial production scale is expected to be 1,000 tons per year of CNTs, starting in 2016. CNTs are advanced, stable, nanomaterials that can enable groundbreaking new applications in a range of materials and devices. We are also in talks over a pharmaceuticals production project, which will be a completely new industry for Azerbaijan.</p><h4>With the 2015-2020 State Program on Industrial Development of the Azerbaijan Republic having now been endorsed by the President, what new opportunities are emerging?</h4><p>The State Program identifies development perspectives and sets responsibilities for achieving targets. One of the priorities set in the State Program is the expansion of a competitive heavy industry utilizing domestic raw materials. In recent years, sufficient cement output has been achieved to cover domestic consumption using locally sourced raw materials. It is also necessary to allocate advanced-technology driven production, especially in the development of base materials in the metallurgy and petrochemical industries. Moreover, the development of metallurgy will improve the raw material supply to the newly established shipbuilding industry, improve competitiveness, and create a suitable environment for the development of the engineering industry. New production facilities in the chemical industry, metallurgy, machinery and equipment manufacturing, and alternative and renewable energy paraphernalia are now gaining momentum. The establishment of new high-tech facilities has also been prioritized with new opportunities for the expansion of electronic equipment manufacturing being carefully considered. High-tech industries require an extensive R&amp;D platform, and we are concentrating on a limited number of businesses specializing in this. The development of industrial demand is in a transition period from the import-substitution industrialization strategy to export promotion. The production supplying local demand is lacking the capacity to reduce the cost, and there is an unattainability of long-term high growth rates in the domestic demand. Industrial diversification requires the establishment of new alternative production capacities, alongside some conventional industries. Opportunities in the industrialization of agriculture are undeniable in Azerbaijan. The state is offering comprehensive support to businesses and eco-friendly farming is increasingly gaining momentum. The development of the necessary infrastructure facilities for supply and storage of agricultural products is seen as a potentially beneficial area for investments. Additionally, an increasing number of areas in the services sector are promising in terms of the availability of resources and infrastructure. Construction of a new international sea trade port is to become the largest seaport facility in the Caspian basin, and sets a potent showcase for further investments. In the words of Thomas Edison: “Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work." Azerbaijan has held a leading position in the region in terms of macroeconomic stability. We at AIC are here for those who are looking for a reliable partner to explore these opportunities.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[critical-considerations]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have CTA's key achievements been over the past 18 years?</h4><p>The main achievement of those 18 years has been the institutionalization of a private-public dialogue and consolidation of a partnership with the government. This has helped in the pursuit of reform initiatives. CTA has grown as an organization, putting us in a position to meet the demand for reforms in Mozambique.</p><h4>How would you describe the significance of the association for the community?</h4><p>I have noticed a distinct improvement in civil society organizations (CSOs) in Mozambique; conscious of their weaknesses, CSOs have sought to consolidate their achievements and evolve their practices. Mozambique is on track with a global movement towards sustainable democratic rule and rule of law. However, good governance remains a challenge within CSOs.</p><div class="quote">“By the end of 1H2015, the Business Centre will be in operation."</div><h4>What are the key sectors that SME operate in in Mozambique, and what challenges do they face?</h4><p>The lack of a reliable national database of companies makes it difficult for analysts and policymakers to get a clear perspective of businesses operating in different sectors and provinces. However, several studies reveal that access to credit, technology, and land remain major challenges for SMEs. Operating in Tete and Moatize, there are nine coal mining companies including Vale Mozambique, Rito Tinto Mines of Benga, Mine of Moatize, JSPL, Mines of Revubué, Mid West 1151, Rio Tinto Coal Zambezi, and Nkondeze; this group of companies invested $8.5 billion in 2012, which represented approximately 60.70% of GDP. In Nampula the main mining operations are the heavy sands Moma, Kenmare, and more recently the heavy sands of Sangage in the Angoche district, operated by Chinese company Haiyu Mozambique Mining Company. Heavy investment in mining has stimulated growth in the turnover of certain national companies. Rio Tinto spent $776 million between 2011 and 2013 on local acquisitions and created a business center that had trained and certified 90 local companies by the end of 2013. Also by the end of 2013, Vale Mozambique had spent $2.8 billion with local suppliers, involving more than 1,800 companies</p><h4>What will be the role of CTA's Business Centre?</h4><p>By the end of 1H2015, the Business Centre will be in operation. It will be a space for businesses to network, receive the CTA's advice and assistance, and will ensure access to legal requirements for consultation. We are preparing simplified manuals relevant to Mozambican business legislation to make it easier for entrepreneurs to comprehend legal provisions.</p><h4>What are the main CTA initiatives in terms of education and training?</h4><p>The CTA, in partnership with the Fund for the Environment of Business (FAN), approved a project to train policy makers and entrepreneurs on how to approach the subject of local content, for greater involvement as the government addresses the issue.</p><h4>You recently organized a conference on the impact of natural resources on tourism. How do you foresee the tourism sector developing over the next five years?</h4><p>Tourism will continue to grow if certain measures are taken by the government to prevent the exploitation of natural resources. Currently, business tourism is on the rise, while leisure tourism is declining. This may be the result of new businesses being encouraged by the influx of FDI, or it could mean the country is not doing enough to attract tourists for leisure. Over the next five years, this trend is likely to continue given that the constraints that leisure tourism faces are structural in nature.</p><h4>What are your objectives for the upcoming few years?</h4><p>In terms of the CTA's role as the leader of public-private dialogue to improve the business environment, the priority is to reform the current DPP model, and the CTA is already working on a blueprint to this end. Another critical consideration is Mozambique's need for a policy on local content and an aligned industrial policy to ensure that the benefits of natural resource exploitation are also extended to Mozambicans, and to set up bases for industrial development and structural transformation.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have recent macroeconomic trends affected the Peruvian capital markets? What will be the regulatory response?</h4><p>Throughout the past decade, the GDP of Peru has experienced 6.7% annual growth. Moreover, investment has risen from 18% to 28% of Peru's GDP, amounting to more than $57 billion, while external public debt represents just 8.6% of GDP. These indicators in 2014 saw Peru rank among the top 20 countries in the world in terms of internal macroeconomic condition according to the World Economic Forum's World Ranking of Macroeconomic Environment Global Competitiveness Report. The macroeconomic prudence of the country and its favorable legal, economic, and regulatory framework for foreign and local investors have led to successive improvements in the rating of sovereign foreign currency debt by major rating agencies, taking the nation to investment grade. Indeed, Moody's increased its rating for Peru to A3 from BAA2 last July, while Standard &amp; Poor's, as well as Fitch, have raised our credit score to BBB+. When it comes to Peru's securities market, IPOs in 2014 have risen to $1.17 billion, albeit around 33% less than in 2013. In terms of market capitalization, the Lima Stock Exchange exceeded $120 billion in 2014, but without regaining the heights scaled in 2012. The securities market has suffered from external factors such as reduced growth in Asia and lower commodity prices. For mutual funds, however, 2014 was an excellent year. The net asset value exceeded $6.2 billion with positive growth of 6.5% with respect to 2013, while the number of mutual fund participants has increased to a historical high of 352,000. Those are the fundamentals of the Peruvian market today, and have resulted from a consistent and firmly rooted regulatory regime.</p><h4>Transaction costs have recently been cut in an effort to build trade volumes on the Lima Stock Exchange. What other efforts are being made to encourage liquidity?</h4><p>When one talks of the drop in transaction costs, which is not just seen on the Lima Stock Exchange's fee, but also in the transactions fees we charge, it does appear large. Yet when you consider the forces that have combined to deepen and improve the financial markets in Peru, you cannot just think of lower transactions costs, but should also consider the valuable regulatory measures and other factors we have introduced to the country. Thus, the SMV through its three fundamental roles of regulation, supervision, and promotion has pursued actions to facilitate the incorporation of new issuers through the more intensive use of capital markets as a source of financing, promoting access to new investors, and strengthening investor security. The SMV has been making continuous efforts toward compliance with these objectives, educating Peruvian business owners in the benefits of the capital markets and also working to bring foreign capital into the country. In order to increase the number of issuers in the Peruvian capital markets, we have clarified and relaxed the rules and regulations of public offering, reducing the number of prerequisites to foster wider financial market participation. Also, we have designed mechanisms for incorporating new investors, but in turn ensured that these have the information and knowledge of the risks associated with their investment decisions. A third, but important part of our mission, has been to visit universities and trade-related entities to encourage participation in the capital markets, which has far-reaching consequences of greater transparency and better corporate governance.</p><div class="quote">“Five companies have secured financing on the alternative market to date."</div><h4>How are you working to make MILA a genuine partnership?</h4><p>The Integrated Latin American Market (MILA) between the Pacific Alliance countries, which includes Peru, is important for us. With the entry of Mexico late in 2014, we as regulators must work to coordinate new rules or regulations in order to ease their entry and presence on the MILA market. Ultimately, the MILA strengthens the Pacific Alliance and the economic relationship among the four member countries. The major barriers we face are unstandardized regulations and currency restrictions on the securities markets of certain member countries, leading to regulators, stock exchanges, and custodians of the member countries fostering common ground for coordination.</p><h4>What is the future of the alternative market project?</h4><p>It took a while to get established, but has now taken off. Five companies have secured financing on the alternative market to date, and there are various others in the pipeline. The interesting consideration about this project is that it has the potential to bring smaller companies that have less than PEN200 million (about $66 million) or so in annual revenue to the capital markets. We have also relaxed certain requirements, whereby, for example, instead of two risk ratings, companies now require just one. This makes it easier for non-corporate companies to access financing. Those companies to have done so not only secured a reasonable rate, but also were also pleased to help us to promote the benefits of the market to others. Another arena that we regulate and that saw success in 2014 is the institutional investor market. This is a market of hybrid offerings directed exclusively at institutional investors. It involves part public and part private offers, with the private component directed at institutional investors. Recently, the first program in this institutional investor market was registered; it was an issuance by the IFC and the first multinational issuance in Peru.</p><h4>What changes do you envision in the regulatory regime of Peru over the coming years?</h4><p>For 2015, we plan to normalize numerous regulations and introduce a raft of new ones. Back in 2011, a reform of ours encouraged IPOs, and proved successful enough to prompt surrounding countries such as Ecuador, among others, to work on implementing similar legislation. For 2015 we have planned structural reforms that will facilitate the process of holding IPOs and also help to create new mutual funds. These structural reforms will make those funds more agile and cheaper, as well as allow better access for citizens. We are also working on programs that will ensure that the entities regulated by are fully conversant with the regulations that govern their activities, especially regarding privileged information. In 2015 we are also working on a register of social responsibility programs that have been committed to by listed companies. It is important that we both record and encourage corporate acts of sustainable development. We also plan to modernize the regulations regarding risk; we will standardize these measures with the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO guidelines). Since 2013, we have had risk supervision programs in place, and are working to improve and deepen them in order to foster a regulatory regime based on risk. Another regulation we are working to amend concerns indirect property and economic groups. We will amend the regulations to international standards and ensure that various domestic agencies are subject to matching regulations that are not duplicated. Also of note, in 2016, Peru is set to host the annual meeting of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO).</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance of Kazakhstan for the company?</h4><p>For the region, Kazakhstan is a sizeable tobacco market, but from a global perspective, it not the biggest. Imperial Tobacco is represented in about 160 different countries. Kazakhstan is a growing market for us. We recently reached a record market share of 9.3%, and have been growing for the last three years.</p><h4>What are the main trends, and habits, of smokers in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>Tobacco consumers are very similar no matter where you go in the world. A consumer buys a pack of cigarettes, smokes it, and then goes back to the store and buys another one. But there are differences as well. In Kazakhstan, around 86% of smokers consume reduced-strength products. In Western Europe and other places, a lot of people smoke full-flavor products. Also, the Kazakhstani culture is different; people like to dress well, especially women. There is a bit of a showoff culture and people like to show what they're doing. This tendency relates to every FMCG company because consumption is a statement here. People put their car keys on the table next to their bags, and so on. These things are noticed, and they send a message. I try to build my organization around understanding why adult consumers choose and how they make their choices. We don't do anything to encourage non-smokers to start smoking or to prevent smokers from quitting. As a business we compete to ensure that adult smokers choose our brands over those of the competition.</p><div class="quote">“We don't do anything to encourage non-smokers to start smoking or to prevent smokers from quitting."</div><h4>What brands are driving your growth in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>We have a very focused portfolio. It's basically Davidoff, West, and Imperial Classic. The larger the portfolio, the more complicated the strategy. It is much easier to run a focused portfolio. We separate our bands into strike SKUs and secondary. The strike SKUs are the ones that are everywhere. These are products that mass market and the secondary ones are more niche.</p><h4>What challenges does your business face here in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>The challenges that we face are no different from those in any other country. I have worked in Spain, Russia, Belarus, Macedonia, Kosovo, Albania, the UK, and more. FMCG is all the same—you make a product, sell a product, get it to a consumer point of sale, and the consumer buys it. We are a tobacco company, so there are challenges inherent to our sector to which we strictly adhere. As a company, we then find where the opportunity lies within the legal framework, and make that our focus.</p><h4>What challenges are there when recruiting quality human capital in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>Recruitment is always a challenge. Right now the only position that we are recruiting from abroad is our intelligence manager, and he is tasked with developing local talent here in our organization. About seven or eight expatriates have left and been replaced by local talent since I have been here. I have tried to grow people from within the organization, give them the opportunity, and nurture them to build some sustainability. I want to recruit people not for the job they are doing, but for the job they can do in three to five years' time. I always recruit people who challenge me on the basis of intelligence as this pushes me to increase my performance. We run a very open and non-hierarchical organization. I enjoy the people coming in and giving me their point of view as long as they are doing it in the right way. This relationship allows employees to actively contribute. Anyone can come and bring ideas. There is an open-door policy. We especially try to involve the more junior members of the organization.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How are sports a part of the culture in Abu Dhabi and the UAE?</h4><p>Whether its water sports, such as sailing and swimming, or equestrian sports, polo, or camel racing, there is a strong historical connection between the people of the UAE and sports, both traditional and modern. The late Sheikh Zayed continuously supported sport and the construction of sporting venues. In 1979 we hosted the qualifications for the Asian Cup at Zayed Stadium, our national stadium, which still hosts many leading football and sports events today. We also had an ice skating rink built in Zayed Sports City around the same time. We are proud today that the Abu Dhabi ice hockey team is becoming one of the top Division III teams in the Asian league. This is from a city not known for its winter sports! We also founded the Sheikha Fatima bint Mubarak Sports Academy for Women's Sports to raise awareness and education about sport for women, and to sponsor some of Abu Dhabi's female sporting talents. These and other sporting developments in Abu Dhabi began with Sheikh Zayed's vision, and continue today with our leadership and our passion for sport. The role of sport is very important for our communities, our families, and our country.</p><h4>What led to the establishment of the Sports Council in 2006?</h4><p>HH Sheikh Mohammed, the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, found there was a need to develop a regulator for sports across Abu Dhabi, not to control sporting clubs and entities, but to support them and enable tournaments to operate at a high level. There was also a need to have an Olympic Committee to organize all types of sports and support new clubs. That is why the Sports Council was formed. We liaise with different segments of the government and private sector to put our joint efforts behind the success of all sports hosted in Abu Dhabi. To date, the Sports Council has successfully hosted many tournaments from different sporting disciplines.</p><div class="quote">“We would like to nurture more sporting heroes in different disciplines."</div><h4>What is the next phase of development for the sports sector in Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>At this stage we are trying to bring in more sporting events that have a direct benefit on the community and individuals using a one-to-one or B2B approach, thus promoting sport as a lifestyle. We would like to keep our calendar busy throughout the year but we are selective in what we host, mainly choosing events that have an international appeal while not overlapping with local sporting events. We are also aiming to establish different classes of tournaments. There is a need to have a mix between hosting official tournaments sanctioned by world federations and other countries, and having exhibition tournaments with a more social appeal. Part of our vision now is to concentrate on hosting sanctioned tournaments that are part of the tournament calendars of world federations. We are bidding for the Asian Cup 2019, and we hope to win it. We are also bidding for the FIFA Club World Cup again. We will host the finals for the Cycling World Tour 2015, which is similar to the Tour de France. We will host an ITU triathlon in 2015 and are bidding to host the FINA swimming 10K World Open Water Swim Tour. We now have an Aero Sports Club, which was founded in November 2014 for those interested in air shows and air sports, such as skydiving. Whenever there is a new sport to establish or support, there is always instruction by our leadership to create new entities. There is so much diversity in sporting disciplines, which reflects the diversity of our local community.</p><h4>How do you ensure the success of tournaments and sporting events hosted here in Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>Quality is crucial. There are a lot of stakeholders who sponsor various activities and sports, such as the Abu Dhabi Tourism and Culture Authority (TCA), the Mubadala Development Company, and the Health Authority Abu Dhabi (HAAD). In addition, the golf clubs, for example, are already hosting a number of well-known tournaments, such as the Abu Dhabi HSBC Golf Championship. It is not a matter of having the money, but having efficiency in what we do. We must see a return on any investment that we make. About 50% of all ticket sales for the Formula One at the Yas Marina Circuit were sold internationally. We had some 30,000 Formula One fans come from outside the UAE—that is the sort of success that we target. The combination of having financial support while at the same time being efficient is a top priority for us, no matter what we host. Our quality comes from that. We do not want to host something once and forget about it; we are looking for long-term consistency. That will never be connected to finance, but rather to efficiency and quality.</p><h4>How important is it for private-sector companies to play a role in promoting sports and sporting events in Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>Commercially, we would like to bring on board more companies from the private sector to show them that they can participate in sports by sponsoring social events or big international events. Major companies such as HSBC, Etihad, Mercedes Benz, Borouge, and ADNOC are doing a very good job. They are giving more, and truly understand the role they can play within the sporting community. They believe in the message that sports can deliver. When companies sponsor or work in partnership with an event they see immediate economic returns.</p><h4>How does the Sports Council facilitate company sponsorships and private-sector support for various sporting events?</h4><p>We have two types of events today. There are the social tournaments, of which we have around 40 to 50 throughout the year. These are directed at both individuals and families in the community. Such events appeal to companies that spend a portion of their sponsorship budget on CSR. Others go for specific events, such as HSBC, which prefers to target the golfing audience. We have created our own marketing and communication department, whose job it is to ensure an appropriate level of sponsorship. The TCA also brings a lot of sponsors into these kinds of events. We are also being approached more and more by companies in the private sector.</p><h4>What are some of the major sporting events on the 2015 sporting calendar?</h4><p>Cycling is one of the most important new events for us in 2015, as well as the triathlon, for which we will host the opening ITU event, and the Women's Bowling Cup 2015, following the Men's Bowling World Cup, which we hosted in 2014. The FINA 10K swimming event will be held for the first time in Abu Dhabi. There is the Mubadala Tennis tournament and HSBC Abu Dhabi Golf Tournament that is held in January every year. We have around 50 entities related to sport, and 27 of these come under our umbrella. Some 23 are actively working to bring more sports into Abu Dhabi. We are very lucky to have around 50% of our sporting activities operated by private entities, not by the government. Our role is to facilitate, if they need our help.</p><h4>How do you view the role of sport in the national economy?</h4><p>The economic effect of having over 30,000 sports fans coming to the UAE just to see the Formula One is huge. When you calculate the amount they spend from a tourism point of view, the effect is significant. Hotels receive the maximum benefit with full occupancy during events, some up to 10 days before an event. It is definitely something that affects every sector. From our perspective, we see immediate returns. We see how sport boosts our community and how it affects our reputation globally. Abu Dhabi's international sporting reputation is considerable due to the passion we have for sports.</p><h4>What is your main aim as you look to the future of sport in Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>Now with both the infrastructure in place and the government support, there is an opportunity to have more champions in different sports, whether it is running, cycling, the triathlon, or tennis. This is what we are working toward and planning for in the future. As an example, Mohammed Khalifa Al Qubaisi is the President of the Emirates Bowling Federation; he is very successful in his career working with ADNOC, but in 1983 he was also the World Bowling Champion. We also have two chess world champions. These sporting figures act as role models. We would like to nurture more sporting heroes in different disciplines. For our champions it is a great source of national pride and the whole country gets involved.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been Coltabaco's milestones since its foundation in 1919?</h4><p>Since 1919, Coltabaco has reinvented itself to be at the forefront and at the same level as the best tobacco companies in the world. Speaking of milestones, I must begin with the most emblematic and significant in our history: the launch of Pielroja in 1924, a hallmark brand not only for Coltabaco, but for Colombia in general, and one that years after its launch would become one of the most popular, with an important market share reaching international markets. Later, in the 1930s, we promoted the Colombian economy through our navigation on the Magdalena River, at a time when we acquired new machinery, equipment, large production capacity, and the tobacco to drive forward navigation of the river, thereby rendering it a vital artery of the economy. Similarly, in the 1940s, we achieved a major recapitalization through a share issuance, which allowed us to invest in modernization thereby launching a decade of high technology. This also saw the start of territorial expansion with new offices and plants in the major geographical areas of Colombia. Later in the 1960s, we entered the blond tobacco market and managed to position four new brands in the Colombian market. These multiple investments began to pay off and it was in the late 1970s when we started our export activity of Colombian black and blond tobacco to Eastern Europe, which encouraged these countries to promote the cultivation of blond tobacco of the Burley variety from the areas of Quindí­o and Santander. From that moment, we undertook a wave of launches, first bringing Derby cigarettes to the market; then, in 1996, launching our Caribe cigarettes, and finally, three years later, the Boston brand that has been well received since its launch, and which has become the number-one cigarette brand in the country by sales. The new century brought new machinery and equipment for the manufacture of cigarettes, especially for the primary manufacturing process, while we sustained exports and launched the Green brand in 2001. Four years later, one of the greatest milestones in the history of Coltabaco was achieved with the acquisition of a 96.65% stake in Coltabaco by PMI, a transaction exceeding $300 million, rated one of the most important in Colombian history. Today, we ourselves are a milestone in Colombian history as the oldest and largest tobacco company in the country, holding 51.8% of the cigarette market, according to Nielsen data, and 99.9% of domestic production.</p><h4>How did the merger with PMI impact Coltabaco's corporate culture in Colombia?</h4><p>It was more about how we decided to merge the two cultures and build one among ourselves, where multinational policies from a company like Philip Morris International blended with the components of a traditional national flagship company such as Coltabaco. From the outset, we knew we had to sustain the concerted national drive that succeeded in developing Colombia and that had become a representative of one of the most important sources of employment. This meant having to adapt to new processes, practices, and international policies that were handled by PMI, which thereafter we would be part of. In essence, there were great cultural matches from the start between the two organizations.</p><div class="quote">“Our funding for social projects focuses on access to education, economic opportunity, and empowerment for women."</div><h4>What were Coltabaco's key capital investments of the past year, and which remain to be made?</h4><p>Coltabaco has continued to make the necessary investments at its manufacturing plant in Medellí­n and at its stemmery tobacco plant in Barranquilla, to ensure their suitability for high technology and plant efficiency in step with PMI's global standards. Since 2005, these investments have exceeded $80 million. Over the past six years, Coltabaco has invested over $9 million in irrigation systems, infrastructure construction for Burley and Virginia tobacco curing, and improved cultivation practices and reforestation in order to improve the productivity of our growers. For the short, medium, and long term, we have established an agenda of activities to increase productivity, which would require investment from Coltabaco and allies such as Fedetabaco, the national government and its departments. From 2015 through 2018, we will be working on six fronts that will require additional investment of $13 million. First, we will be strengthening the experimental farm in Santander through infrastructure, irrigation, greenhouses, and specialized equipment. The second involves the construction, extension, repair, and conversion of the curing sheds of Burley tobacco for Coastal and Santander. The third is the repair and refurbishment of Virginia tobacco curing kilns. The fourth is the supply of clips that will allow a more efficient process of Virginia tobacco drying. The fifth concerns the construction of new greenhouses for the production of seedlings, and the sixth the construction of deep wells and irrigation systems necessary for the cultivation of snuff.</p><h4>How important are PMI's Colombian operations for Latin America?</h4><p>In Latin America, we represent the fourth largest market after Mexico, Argentina, and Brazil, in terms of total volume of cigarettes sold and market share in each country. To PMI Latin America, Colombia is an attractive market of great competition. And although Coltabaco in Colombia has taken important steps, such as its latest launches of L&amp;M, Fortuna, and Piel Roja Blue, it is important to mention that the company has been deeply impacted by contraband cigarettes, the incidence of which has increased dramatically from 1.8% in 2009 to 19% in 2013, according to studies by Invamer, following the government's 50% increase in excise tax on cigarettes. In Colombia, legitimate cigarette sales have fallen over the past three years by about 17%, while consumption falls at an average annual rate of 1.8%; smuggling has replaced the legal product.</p><h4>Since 2008, Coltabaco has positively impacted more than 27,000 people directly and 78,000 indirectly. How will you further expand the social impact of the programs?</h4><p>Within the global context, we have been strengthening our lines of action based on the needs of the most vulnerable populations. Our funding for social projects focuses on access to education, economic opportunity, and empowerment for women, as well as disaster relief. We are finishing the installation of 22 stores operated by 66 victims of armed conflict and assisting more than 600 displaced families return to their land located in el Carmen de Bolivar. And in relation to productive opportunities, we are creating a distribution channel for 20 veteran women keen to market their products and boost the economic development of their families and communities. Similarly, we believe job creation to be a vital achievement, and accordingly purchase tobacco leaf from over 5,000 farmers, providing 100% financing of input, signing a pre-established purchase contract and providing technical advice and assistance when required.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you talk us through ANJE's background?<br></h4><p>ANJE was founded on the idea that certain changes or reforms were required in the economy. The relationship between the public sector and the private sector was very tense at that time, 36 years ago. ANJE's founder believed that businesspeople needed to promote the necessary reforms on the economy to increase the level of private sector participation, and also to strengthen our public sector. A key role that ANJE plays is to adopt a critical view on certain issues that are affecting the economy and social development, including services, the regulatory framework, and national as well as foreign investment.</p><h4>What are the main benefits of being a member of ANJE and what activities are you currently involved in?</h4><p>One of the benefits of being a member is preferential access to certain activities, not only those of ANJE, but also training activities that academic and other institutions offer. Another benefit is having the opportunity to participate in public debates and impact the public agenda through many initiatives such as the National Development Strategy. We have collaborated with Congress to incorporate our ideas on improving both the efficiency and the transparency of our public institutions. Now we have an information-based society that facilitates this somewhat. We are also in favor of modifying our labor code to incorporate more flexible norms, both in terms of the major topics under public scrutiny and also in terms of implementation improvements, especially those related to process. With the labor code, you have to find the right balance between workers and employers to increase employment rates, improve the labor market and to make it a driver of legality, prosperity and equality. There are many issues to be solved and we are pleased that the dialogue between employers, workers, and the government has been restarted. We really hope that we can have a more flexible and modern labor code in the future.</p><h4>What is your general outlook for the Dominican Republic's economy and in what sectors do you see the greatest growth potential?</h4><p>We are concerned about the commercial sector, especially retail, which is one of the sectors that used to have a very big influence in the economy for many years. We think that current growth is heavily affected by the impact that the mining sector has had on the economy. We have to be prepared for what we are going to do when the mining sector leaves the country in 20, or maybe less, years. Mining is a sector where there is adverse public opinion, which I think is normal. However, we will not be able to sustain our mining sector over the long term because it is a finite resource. I think that the economy is improving; nevertheless ANJE is concerned about the public debt. The Senate just approved a deficit budget again and there are some points that I think as a country we need to review, such as the price of oil and the electricity sector subsidy. And even though the judicial system's budget has increased slightly, I believe the government hasn't supported that sector properly. It is one of the most important sectors because it creates the right balance of power between the legislature and the executive branch of government. I also think we have to support the industrial sector more. We have to address the issues that are affecting our industrial sector to increase productivity, competitiveness and make our economy one that is able to export more rather than import. Tourism and the commercial sector are also vital. Technology is a less explored sector, but we have advanced in this area over the last ten years. The telecommunications sector has always been one of the main drivers.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Superintendency of Securities has recently approved EGE Haina's initial public offering, and its outstanding corporate bonds amount to $140 million. What investments are being funded at this time?<br></h4><p>EGE Haina is currently the largest private issuer in the Dominican capital markets. Over the course of its lifetime, it has structured $280 million in local bonds, including a new $100 million bond that has recently received approval from the local Securities Exchange Commission (Superintendencia de Valores, SIV). EGE Haina is currently developing a new 50MW wind project next to the existing Los Cocos windfarm, called Larimar. The new wind farm will be composed of 15 state-of-the art Vestas V112 wind generators, each with a 3.3MW capacity. This project is expected to be fully operational by 1Q2016. In addition, we are in the process of building a 1.5 MW solar photovoltaic plant in San Pedro de Macorí­s to be completed in 3Q2015.</p><h4>What have been the highlights of EGE Haina's performance in 2014?</h4><p>EGE Haina has had an excellent year by all metrics. With the recent addition of Los Cocos 2 (January 2013) and Quisqueya 2 (December 2013), our energy generation has increased from 1,687 GWh in the first 10 months of 2013 to 2,671 GW in the same period of 2014, on a 58% increase. Year to date we have posted a record generation of 2,953 GWh, which allows us to provide one-fifth of the KWh consumption of the Dominican Republic. In 2014, the additional generation provided by the Quisqueya complex has reduced the cost of power in the Dominican Republic's wholesale market by approximately 30%, or 5¢ per KWh. We also achieved our best heat rate ever at an average of 8,780 BTU/KWh HHV. Similarly, with the wind power production from Los Cocos, EGE Haina has reduced YTD emissions by 155,132 tons of CO2 and has saved the country 327,286 barrels of imported fuel. In 2014 we added 1.7 MW of new generation at Pedernales by installing a new Hyundai engine. In terms of health and safety, our performance was excellent, with only two minor lost time incidents for the whole year. With the significant increase in production, one might expect total operating costs to increase, too. Yet to the contrary, through a series of cost saving measures and the relocation and optimization of resources, total operating costs in the first 10 months of 2014 were only 1.6% higher when compared to the same period of 2013. Most notably, G&amp;A expenses were reduced by 40% in relation to 2013. During 2014 the company concluded the refinancing of a $175 million international bond, which included the issuance of a $100 million bond in the local debt capital market.</p><h4>What challenges is EGE Haina facing with regard to the power sector, and what initiatives have to be taken to improve sector performance and competitiveness?</h4><p>The principle obstacle in the electricity sector remains the poor operational performance of the distribution companies, which is characterized by substantial energy losses resulting from electricity theft by end users. This situation has been exacerbated by the increase in fuel prices over the past five years, which has heavily impacted the distribution companies' financial results and ability to pay for energy purchases from generators, such as EGE Haina. We believe that tackling energy theft in the country should be the first priority to achieve sector competitiveness.</p><h4>As a pioneer and leader in production of renewable energy in the Dominican Republic, could you tell us about your view on the transformation of the national energy sector and your prospects for clean technologies and renewable energy production?</h4><p>Over the past 15 years, the country's energy matrix has gone from being 90% dependent on foreign oil imports, to being a diversified generation portfolio based on water, wind, natural gas, coal, and only 40% oil. Renewable energy is becoming a significant source of power for the Dominican system. In 2016, approximately 20% of the country's electricity will come from renewable energy sources (mainly water and wind). It is our hope that clean energy will continue to grow as a source of power for the Dominican Republic. At EGE Haina we are investing significant resources in wind and solar energy and hope to continue leading renewable generation in the private sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has UNO evolved since its establishment and why did you decide to start operations here in the Dominican Republic?<br></h4><p>In 2004, our Board decided to set up here in Santiago, based on the availability of skilled resources and the need for such services globally. Santiago's population and the local education system rank among the key reasons for establishing the operations. We are an experienced global management sector team. I brought my personal experience of 27 years in the technology industry, and we had around 20 employees at UNO at that point. Then, in the first year we grew by 900%. We continue to develop our company by keeping ahead of the game when it comes to processes. The other reason for setting up here was the wealth of educated resources in Santiago in different business sectors, such as HR, IT, marketing, and business development. There were so many untapped resources back in 2005. Santiago has a talented and well educated workforce. These people were looking for a future and more importantly a career. Since 2005, the continued support from the country's administration has helped us strengthen our position in the marketplace. One of our initiatives since 2006 is the English Emersion Program, which is a joint mission through the call-center company industry in the Dominican Republic and the government. Our aim was to train 100,000 young students in the English language. UNO has an English language university, and we have 600 students graduating every semester. Approximately 40% of each graduating class decides to work for UNO. They can develop different careers with us in customer Service, IT support, HR, quality assurance, marketing, and even business development.</p><h4>What types of operations is UNO involved in?</h4><p>There are three core services we provide today, technical support, acquisitions, and customer support. Approximately 85% of our business is in those service verticals. Other services we provide include BPO, quality assurance, and application support and maintenance. UNO has provided custom solutions for each of our client partners, resulting in relationships that extend beyond eight years. We understand our clients must remain competitive and this drives change. UNO has to provide flexibility in our service delivery model to embrace our clients' needs. This is the primary reason we have been successful. We support clients in Asia, the US, Europe, and Latin America.</p><h4>UNO obtained PCI Data Security Standard (Level 1) in June 2011. What is the importance of this certification in terms of building customer trust?</h4><p>My strategy for 2011 was to implement security standards based on my previous experience in IT technology—I had federal and commercial clients that demanded the highest level of data security; therefore, we started initiating the PCI DSS process in 2009. We hired consultants to walk us through the process, but ultimately received accreditation by undertaking the work internally. We have never had a breach of security, or had a complaint filed against us by any of our clients. We do not actually store the data here, but ensure that any data transmitted is encrypted.</p><h4>The call center industry has generated more than 32,000 positions over the past few years, with 56,000 posts anticipated by 2016. How does UNO plan to respond to that upward trend?</h4><p>Our goal is to grow by 35% per year. Our growth is driven by our attention to quality. Every UNO client is provided with a bespoke solution so there is no cookie-cutter solution, such as with multinational companies. We want to take our brand to the highest level, but it is my responsibility as CEO to set our strategy and differentiate our brand. Our geographic location works to our advantage. We can offer world-class services at competitive rates. Many clients can't afford to commute on long haul flights anymore as it effects their productivity. We have over six airlines that provide more than 20 flights a day into Santiago from the US, and we are a two-hour drive from Santo Domingo. UNO is an award winning call center company, and we are recognized internationally.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>Even though the Dominican Republic is one of the fastest growing economies in its region, with average 5.7% GDP growth over the past two decades, poverty remains a core issue. What initiatives have to be taken to improve the conditions of those in greatest need?<br></h4><p>If there is one message regarding the Dominican Republic, it is that it has truly been a high flyer, an achiever in terms of economic growth in the region. From 1991 to 2013, it grew at 5.7% per year. In 2011 GDP per capita was 50% above that of 2000, whereas in Latin America, on average, GDP per capita rose 26% over the same period. The Dominican Republic, along with Panama and Peru, has been among the most rapidly growing economies in the region in recent years. The difference between the region and here is that the Dominican Republic's high growth rate has not led to the same level of poverty reduction. Whereas in Latin America more than 70 million people have been lifted out of poverty since 2003, here in the DR we have a poverty rate today exceeding that of 2000. Four out of 10 Dominicans still live in poverty, and almost one in 10 lives in extreme poverty. Therefore, there is still clearly much work to do in spite of the high growth rates, to generate more and better jobs for faster poverty reduction.</p><h4>What is the World Bank's role in supporting national development?</h4><p>Our role as the World Bank is to be on the one hand a trusted advisor and a provider of knowledge services, that the government can turn to and count on, bringing insights from experiences in other countries that the government can then use to determine the program it wants to put in place. The second role we play concerns financing development projects with a focus on better services and opportunities for the poor. Thirdly, we provide support in such areas as bringing together diverse actors, both nationally and internationally, to exchange ideas. The World Bank Group's key mission is the elimination of extreme poverty by 2030 at a global level, meaning no more than 3% of people around the world living in extreme poverty by 2030. This is consistent with the government's own vision of just 2% or less of the Dominican population living in extreme poverty by 2030.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the achievements of the Dominican government in that regard?</h4><p>The vision for 2030 is a state vision, one of the people and one that has been consulted with thousands of Dominicans. It is a vision that has been enacted into law and that goes beyond any given government, and hopefully will guide all administrations between now and 2030. I think there are certain areas where clear progress is being made: one important area is social protection. If we go back to the 2003 to 2004 period, there was no social safeguard in place at the time of the severe banking and macroeconomic crisis. Inflation rose, real wages did not keep up, unemployment rose, poverty climbed from 32% to almost 50%, and there was no safety net to protect the poor. Yet today there is a social safety net in place that reaches over 800,000 Dominican households, and at a reasonably low cost as a share of GDP. Moreover, an increasing share of this program is being carefully targeted, and more importantly being conditioned on actions that increase the human capital of the poor and strengthen their health and the education of their children, so that it is not just a handout, but rather, an investment in human capital.</p><h4></h4><h4>In the newly released Doing Business report, the Dominican Republic was in 84th place. Could you interpret the result of the rankings as well as the country's performance over recent years?</h4><p>The Dominican Republic is one of the two economies that has introduced the most reforms in the Caribbean region in recent years. Only Jamaica has done more. The DR advanced significantly during the 2005-2009 period and has again taken several steps more recently to strengthen its position. The Dominican Republic ranks 84th in the world among 189 economies. It is encouraging that it is focusing on strengthening the investment climate, and indeed it has a dynamic program underway to continue strengthening its reforms, particularly through the Ministry of Economy, Planning and Development, but also through several other entities within the state and the private sector. In fact it took steps over the past year to reduce the number of forms needed for importing and exporting and that contributed to its strong position. There are other areas where it took steps this past year: for example, the protection of personal information through Law 172-13, which was important because it covers credit information, and therefore access to credit. In addition, the country has taken steps to strengthen the laws relating to transparency, governance, and the protection of minority shareholders. In the area of trading across borders, the Dominican Republic is now in 24th place and therefore among the top countries in the world. It is also among the top 50% in the world in 6 out of 10 indicators. The latest Doing Business report introduced an important concept this year called “distance to the frontier." This metric enables you see an absolute measure of how far you are from the best practice in the world on a given Doing Business indicator and on aggregate across all 10 indicators. The Dominican Republic is among the top third of countries in the world this year in terms of its improvement on the aggregate 'Distance to the Frontier' measurement.</p><h4>What sectors of the Dominican economy hold the most potential for further development?</h4><p>One concern over the past decade was that in the rest of the region around 42% of people were upwardly mobile, rising from poor to vulnerable, from vulnerable to middle-income, or from middle-income to upper income, while in the Dominican Republic only 2% of the population moved up an income class. In fact one in five, 19%, moved down an economic class. So the real challenge is addressing the underlying cause of that. What we observe from Central Bank and other data is that there had been a large increase in productivity, which is 40% higher today than in 2000, but this has been accompanied by a decline in real wages. There are sectors that have done well in growth, such as telecommunications, which rose from 8% to 23% of the economy, and mining, which has recently been significant in terms of its contributions to growth and to improving the country's export performance. Yet neither of these sectors has generated significant employment, while many jobs have been lost since 2004 in the Special Economic Zones. The country has a number of areas of potential beyond the above sectors, including tourism and agriculture. For example, the Cibao valley is highly fertile and there is tremendous potential for adding value to that agricultural production and generating more jobs by linking it more to global markets. This involves strengthening phytosanitary standards, grading, cold chains, storage facilities, and financing for agriculture to get more high-quality Dominican products into a global value chain, as well as investing in agri-business to generate greater added value and employment here in the country.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>According to the Central Bank, FDI in the Dominican Republic has increased by 245.5% over the past decade. What factors drove that expansion and what sectors of the economy hold the greatest potential for growth?<br></h4><p>For the last 35-40 years, the Dominican Republic has seen political stability. And while as a developing nation we still have numerous issues that need addressing, we enjoy liberty and democracy, which is conducive to investment. Also, in the Dominican Republic there is no restriction on the movement of currency, which is an issue in certain other countries. Furthermore, as a country we are strategically well located, close to the US as well as Central and Latin America. Moreover, the Dominican Republic has advantageous trade agreements with the European Union, Central America, and the US. These factors combined make the Dominican Republic a choice investment address.</p><h4>Have the free trade agreements (FTAs) allowed the Dominican Republic to fully exploit its potential as an investment destination?</h4><p>I would say yes, but even though we have had that possibility for many years, we have yet to take full advantage. The country would be better positioned if we had a greater focus on the potential benefits of FTAs.</p><h4>What are the major advantages of investing in the Dominican Republic and what would be your message to potential international investors seeking opportunities in the region?</h4><p>Most importantly, we have a country with laws protecting foreign corporations. Also, even though we still have the opportunity to improve our education system, the country has really addressed the issue by increasing the expenditure for education, and there are a lot of entrepreneurs getting involved in education. That means we are addressing the issue, which eventually is going to increase productivity. Also, there is a major discussion between labor unions and business on the potential revision of the labor code to foster greater competitiveness.</p><h4>What is the role of public-private partnerships (PPP) in the development of the economy, and what initiatives has the Dominican Foreign Investment Companies Association (ASIEX) taken to strengthen the investment climate and promote the country as an FDI destination?</h4><p>One of the major challenges faced by the country is the need to broaden public-private relations. I would say that this could be a true instrument of progress, which somehow our country has been reluctant to utilize. I have seen PPPs that eventually benefit the country because of the synergy between the knowledge and capacity of the private corporates and the balance that the government or public brings into that relationship. ASIEX as an organization doesn't have this as its vision or mission. Basically, we work with companies that have already been established in this country. One promise we made to the President was that since many corporates and institutions that belong to ASIEX have offices around the world, we could work together to develop a solid strategy for the international promotion of the Dominican Republic. This is a work-in-progress. We have a firm relationship with the Export and Investments Center of the Dominican Republic (CEI-RD) and will eventually revise the law for foreign investment in the Dominican Republic together. We work with over 35 lawyers in our legal community and have already assigned four of them to work directly with CEI-RD in revising the law on foreign investment. I believe that doing this will bring numerous benefits for both the private and public sectors, in combining their unique international experience.</p><h4>How would you rate the regulatory efficiency in the Dominican Republic in terms of incorporating a business?</h4><p>I would say that we are making progress, although there is still ground to cover. Indeed, we are working with the CEI-RD on revising the foreign investment law. We still believe there will be great opportunities for the country to develop if we expedite the process, which the President appears keen to do.</p><h4>The Dominican Republic ranked 117 out of 189 countries in the Doing Business 2014 survey, declining five places since 2013. What factors led to that drop and what initiatives have to be taken to strengthen the Dominican Republic's position in the rankings?</h4><p>There are many areas of the survey in which we lag significantly. My perception, again, is that if we continue to strengthen the relationship between the public and private spheres, we can advance up the rankings.</p><h4>What goals has ASIEX set for 2015?</h4><p>We are set to focus on several areas, including mining, foreign investment law, and the strengthening of our international competitiveness to do business. We also intend to work with the government on a means of reducing the tax level.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Patria Compañí­a de Seguros, S. A. was founded on July 26th, 1971. How did the concept arise and how has the company evolved since its foundation?<br></h4><p>The company was founded by my father, also named Rafael Bolí­var Nolasco. Back then, he worked for  another insurance company as the regional manager in Santiago, but saw that this company could have operated a lot more efficiently. As a result, he began looking for people to work on his personal  project, his dream, and within two years found an investor in Dr. Miguel Ángel Luna Morales. The company had its ups and downs, as start-ups usually have, but at around the year 1989, Dr. Morales passed away, and the company struggled. For this reason, my father had to acquire the company in its entirety. Those were some challenging years for my father, trying to keep the company afloat amongst a lot of turmoil. Since its foundation, the company started working in the vehicle insurance niche, where it has positioned itself. My father always believed in a company oriented toward helping his family and in a family-run model. All of my four siblings have been or are still active in this business, the eldest of my brothers passed away on July 2000 while holding the position of Vice-President of the company, and that is when my father asked me to come and join him.</p><h4>What is the composition of your portfolio and what sort of clientele are you targeting?</h4><p>When I joined the company I saw that we had a strategic weakness in being a one-product company. I suggested to my father, who was the company president  at that time, that we should diversify so we wouldn't end up in a bad position in terms of our company image. A few years later, I managed to convince him because due to  considerable foreign investment in the country at the time, including such firms as Mapfre and Seguros Constitucion, the market began to change, which created new challenges for us to try and remain competitive. To be able to thrive in the new commercial climate required us to change the company image, broaden our offer, and implement changes in the infrastructure and in our computer systems.</p><p>I was appointed President in December 2005, but back then, our main office in Santo Domingo was located  in a building on the 4th floor , with no parking space and no elevator.  We managed to move the office to a much more adequate place where we had access to our clients in Santo Domingo, and we also transformed our image. We looked for reinsurance companies that could provide us with the support we needed. Currently, our main business is still car insurance, but within this area we have many subcategories. Auto liability insurance is about 80% or 85% of our  business, and then there is full auto coverage, which is the segment that could represent the most growth in the company, but it is also the segment that could represent the most claims because of the lack of traffic education and traffic law enforcement  in the Dominican Republic. There is another subcategory, which is cargo insurance, and we have grown considerably in this area. We did not have that category six years ago, but we  now insure trucks for liability, as well as the container and the cargo. That has been one of our key growth segments. There is also liability insurance, which we do not usually offer as a single product, and instead if someone wants liability insurance for their business, we  will also offer property, theft alongside other coverages as well. Currently, financial institutions  are requesting unemployment insurance, which is not a product we  have considered providing, although depending on circumstances we might enter this area in 2015.</p><p>In terms of channels and of sales distribution, there are many opportunities for new sales channels for microinsurance policies. We are analyzing the possibility of offering products in new channels the following year.</p><h4>Despite being vulnerable to natural disasters, a significant proportion of the population lacks insurance. What initiatives should be taken to raise awareness and increase up-take?</h4><p>It has to start with the government insuring infrastructure. We experience heavy rains, and flooding is frequent, making this an urgent area of attention. Importantly, incentives need to be put forward to encourage the use of insurance, not only in terms of property, but also with life insurance. We probably are one of the only countries in the world to levy a tax on life insurance, which really does not help. People need to be educated about insuring their life, as well as their cars, their homes and their businesses. It is just as well that the country has been  rather lucky that since 1998 it has not seen a hurricane affect it in the way that Hurricane Georges did.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What steps is the Ministry of Energy and Mining taking to help the Dominican Republic take full advantage of its mineral potential?<br></h4><p>In many ways the Dominican Republic is a mini continent unto itself. It possesses an amazing diversity of renewable and nonrenewable resources, in both metallic and non-metallic mining. We now have greater knowledge than before of our mineral potential, thanks to the SYSMIN (System of Stabilization of Export Earnings from Mining Products) Cooperation Programme of the European Union, which provided us with multiple geological and resource referenced maps, covering approximately 96% of the territory. It is a privilege for our Geological Service to hold so much information. As a newly-created ministry we are engaged in generating our initial strengths as defined by our strategic plan. As a key part of our agenda, we will seek to improve  the overall  management of the industry, and the  defense of public interests, raising the standards of regulation and control, and to increase our arbitration capacity as a means of obtaining social licenses and attracting more qualified investments. We are integrating a highly qualified professional team and establishing partnerships with national and international institutions for the training of our human resources, and establishing new standards for exceptional service for potential investors. In 2015, we hope to promote a multi-sectorial consultation to improve  the legitimacy of mining activities, and we hope to address important issues such as the definition of investment objectives, which must be financed with mining revenues. We must also finish the EITI (Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative), and establish a “win-win-win" strategy where the state wins, the enterprises win, and so do the communities. We are also engaged in reviewing and updating aspects as important as establishing the cost of exploration patents, expediting and providing further reliability to the Mining Cadastre, formalizing and adding value to small-scale and community mining, and simplifying  legal proceedings of concessions to mining companies.</p><h4>What initiatives is the Ministry undertaking to overcome expensive imported fossil fuels and an inability to purchase power from neighboring countries?</h4><p>The Ministry promotes an energy security agenda that has a strategic goal: to reduce the dependency on imported fossil fuels, should we not achieve self-sufficiency. We are focused on simultaneously boosting oil exploration on land and at sea, and also on the state's promotion of renewable energy.</p><h4>What is your view on the transformation of the energy sector in the Dominican Republic and what are your prospects for the future of clean technologies and renewable energy production in the drive for increased economic growth?</h4><p>The energy sector in the Dominican Republic must undergo major changes, especially in the electricity subsector. Already the government has arranged a great Electrical Pact, as required by the National Development Strategy. This would  entail a change in the nature of Dominican capitalism, as well as the rules of governance of public companies. Our aim is for management to be transparent, efficient, results-oriented, and de-politicized. We also deem it a high priority to ensure the conversion of the Electric Park to natural gas, although this cannot be done without new infrastructure development policies  and regulation of international standards that ensures access to third parties, neutrality, efficiency, and security in the installation and operation of terminals and pipelines. We believe in developing a network of pipelines on the southern coast, and also in the creation of an energy hub that includes terminals in the Northern region, preferably in the area of Manzanillo, near the border with Haiti. This last point would be of strategic value for us, Haiti, and for the entire region. The border area also has optimal conditions to become a renewable energy generation area as it has the best solar radiation regime, great wind resources, and significant potential for marine energy. Marginal lands owned by the state will be used for the production of biofuels and biomass.</p><h4>Could you talk through the main points of the National Energy Plan 2010-25?</h4><p>The government's energy efficiency and savings plan is focused on achieving significant energy savings in the public sector with the use of various technologies, both in terms of fuel and electricity. In 2015, we will have an energy efficiency and government savings law that will give access to this policy to the entire society. We aim to substantially increase the country's fuel storage capacity, which is crucial in some categories. With a consumption of 140,000 barrels a day, it makes sense to increase the country's refining capacity and take advantage of our geographical location and become a center of storage, processing, mixing, and regional and international distribution.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Dominican Republic ranks second with respect to its wealth of land and water biodiversity among the Caribbean islands. It is also home to 5,600 plant and more than 300 bird species. What initiatives is the Ministry taking to preserve natural diversity?<br></h4><p>The Dominican Republic has 26% of its geography designated as protected area, amounting to a vast area of national parks. Therefore, protection of the fauna, flora, and biodiversity of those areas is a core activity of The Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources. It is crucial for the Dominican Republic to preserve such natural areas as they give the country its unique heritage that must be passed on to future generations.</p><h4>According to the Central Bank, the annual GDP growth rate in the Dominican Republic averaged at 5.5% from 1993 until 2014. In your opinion, which segments of the economy hold most potential for future development?</h4><p>The future growth of the economy will mostly be based on tourism, although the agribusiness will also play an important role. The latter sector, for example, has increased its export figures considerably over recent years. This growth enables us to keep inflation below double-digits and simultaneously achieve macroeconomic stability.</p><h4>Today's world faces many environmental challenges. What issues is the Dominican Republic currently addressing?</h4><p>The main challenge we face is the management of the watershed and river basins. Water is an essential element for our country for both human consumption and industrial usage; for example, to generate electrical energy and support farms. One of the main goals of our Ministry is to recover and preserve the watershed and river basins across the country. We have already done some extraordinary work with, for example, the Yuma and Ozama rivers. This work includes close cooperation with local communities. I would say that deforestation is another key challenge, especially when it comes to the illegal trade of wood and the search for particular plants. Meanwhile, we continue working towards increasing forest cover; we had increased it from 12% in 1967 to 39% by 2014. Our objective is to plant 70 million trees over the next four years. To date we have planted 25 million, and are therefore on the right path. The Ministry also implements a plan to preserve beach areas from climate change and extensive tourist activity. This is a key project of ours, because in order to maintain tourism growth, we must invest in the preservation of our beaches and the surrounding areas.</p><h4>Could you tell us more about the situation in Loma Miranda? How, in your opinion, can a compromise be achieved?</h4><p>We first received the environmental impact report from the company that wanted to exploit the area in 2012, and analyzed if for around 10 months. Ultimately, the report did not meet our expectations and we denied the permit. Our decision was based on Law 6400 of our Constitution. That is all I can say since we are the institution making the final decision on Loma Miranda. The main element in this entire process is the social license; therefore we need to work on better explaining to Dominican citizens the situation and plans for the area.</p><h4>US Vice President Joseph Biden recently visited the Dominican Republic, in order to discuss details of the initiative supporting the production of renewable energy. What is your view on the transformation of the energy sector in the Dominican Republic, and what are the prospects for the future of clean technologies and renewable energy production?</h4><p>We favor the implementation of renewable energy projects as well as the transformation of the national electrical energy matrix. I think the government took the right steps by opening it to private investment, both national and foreign. We prioritize the development of wind and solar energy projects, two weather elements that are widely available in our country. We also see as positive steps the development of less damaging energy production projects in the country, as the main problem the Dominican Republic has traditionally faced concerns its highly polluting energy generation systems. We also have some projects with energy generation companies to plant mahogany trees, which have high CO2 capture levels, around the areas where they have production facilities. Let me add that in the near future we will continue leaning toward the implementation of wind and solar energy projects.</p><h4>What are your main goals for 2015 as Minister of the Environment, and where would you like to see the country at the end of the year?</h4><p>We are pursuing presidential goals, and expect to further advance in the recovery of the river basins along the Yuma and Ozama rivers, two rivers that play an essential role in the production of water in the country. We also want to successfully implement the planting of the 70 million trees I previously mentioned. I want to increase the current 39% of forest cover to 41%.</p>]]></richbody0content>

How has the company developed since its foundation?<br></h4><p>Actually, Avianca is the commercial brand, and is the holding company for all Avianca carriers, which include TACA International Airlines, Trans American Airlines in Peru, LACSA in Costa Rica, and AeroGal in Ecuador. Yet in terms of a commercial brand, you will only see Avianca. We have a little over 19,000 employees, who are renowned for providing world-class customer service. Besides passengers, we also transport cargo as we handle Avianca Cargo under the commercial name of Tampa Cargo. We fly to almost 100 destinations across America, and three in Europe—Madrid, Barcelona, and London, with the latter launched in summer 2014. We have a modern aircraft fleet of about 168 short-, medium-, and long-haul range aircraft. Back in 2012, we joined Star Alliance, which is the largest alliance of the three in the industry. We also have over 5.4 million subscribers to our LifeMiles loyalty program.</p><h4>Avianca's flights departing from Santo Domingo and Punta Cana connect more than 10 countries in South America in addition to Mexico, Panama, and Spain. What is the importance of the Dominican Republic for Avianca's operations?</h4><p>Actually, it is important because the Dominican Republic is the largest market for Avianca in the Caribbean. It is the country that issues the most tickets and transports the most passengers. Within the Caribbean, we have operations in San Juan, Puerto Rico, Aruba, Curaçao, and Cuba, but the Dominican Republic is still the biggest market. It is also significant for us because we have had a great increase in business. We started this operation with three flights a week, and now we have daily flights. We have increased our operations to Lima, too. We only had two flights to begin with and now we have four flights per week to directly serve the Peruvian market. In the Dominican Republic, We have between a 75% and 85% load factor in the low season and 100% occupation load factor in high seasons.</p><h4>How does Avianca distinguish itself from its competitors, and what have been the highlights for the company in 2014?</h4><p>I think one of the key reasons passengers might chose Avianca over other airlines is our level of service, then I would say it is our fleet. We have, on average, five-year-old aircraft, which is new, and most of these planes have onboard personalized entertainment systems. We also have numerous programs for companies, such as leisure packages or corporate fares, where we give companies discounts for every purchase. In terms of highlights for 2014, these were the launch of the new route to London; the launch of the new ATR 72-600 aircraft in Central America, and the addition of the first Airbus A321 for Colombia.</p><h4>In August 2014, Avianca Holdings and its subsidiaries carried more than 2.3 million passengers. That accounts for a 6.6% increase over the same period in 2013. What destinations have enjoyed the greatest popularity and what was the Dominican Republic's performance?</h4><p>In the domestic markets of Colombia, Peru, and Ecuador, Avianca transported more than 1.3 million passengers, which was an 8.7% increase in comparison to August 2013. The seat capacity increased as well by 7.8% and as a result of this, the occupation was 78% of the load factor, which is impressive. For international markets, Avianca transported one million passengers on international routes, on a 3.8% increase, while the seat capacity rose by 3.4%. For the Dominican Republic, the passenger increase was 22%, versus August 2013, while revenues substantially increased by around 20%. We currently have one daily flight to Bogotá from Santo Domingo and flights four times a week to Lima, in addition to daily flights from Punta Cana to Santo Domingo. In the commercial area, we have nine employees, but if we include the airports in Punta Cana and Santo Domingo, it is around 45.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Yobel has become one of the leading South American companies offering outsourcing services in supply chain management. What factors have led to this success?<br></h4><p>We are highly flexible and design all our infrastructure and service platforms based on our customers, and they leverage our technologies and operational know-how. We have implemented a world-class warehouse management system, and our executive staff are certified in Lean Six Sigma, which we are going to extend to the entire organization in 2015. Another relevant factor is that, as a subsidiary company of a Peruvian corporation, we have vast knowledge of the Latin American market. These factors are differentiators for us because most players in this industry are from Europe, the US, or Asia, or have partnerships with local companies, while we are proudly Latin American and operate our own branches.</p><h4>Yobel offers services in supply chain management in 11 countries throughout the Americas. What role does the Dominican Republic play within your international portfolio?</h4><p>The Dominican Republic today is our largest operation in the Caribbean, although Puerto Rico and Panama feature too. For 2015, the Dominican Republic will maintain a leadership role for Yobel in the Caribbean, but Panama is experiencing rapid growth, and I believe by 2016 it will have become the company leader. The Dominican Republic is strategic for us because we manage all our regional operations from here. In Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and Panama the market is in continual growth. We don't have a sizable market share currently, but we are expecting this to change, and are confident of growth in the Dominican Republic. Today, we have notable demand from the pharmaceutical industry. We have implemented a strong quality system for that sector and have considerable experience with consumer goods, cosmetics, technology, and food and beverages; hence, business in the Dominican Republic is important, and there is a wide portfolio of services on offer. Our biggest market is the multinationals.</p><h4>How does the regulatory environment in the Dominican Republic affect Yobel's performance and the logistics industry as a whole?</h4><p>Our business operates within a supportive environment of political and economic stability; the country has a stable growth rate of over 5.5%, while inflation is within the acceptable range, and the currency is stable, although we face other challenges. I consider the labor law complicated, for example. There is a movement among the private sector to propose its amendment, which goes beyond our industry. The employee is currently over-protected under this law, giving a company little space for negotiation when it comes to a dispute. This is something that hinders the normal development of operations and is a sensitive issue among many sectors nowadays. This factor can be seen as favorable for our business since our customers may avoid those complexities by contracting our third-party logistics services.</p><h4>How would you rate the quality of the infrastructure in the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>It is adequate for the market in terms of warehousing and roads. Yet, any serious attempt to transform the Dominican Republic into a hub will demand more modern infrastructure and a regulatory law. For example, the Port of Caucedo being constructed in partnership with DP World is building some infrastructure for our business to establish logistics centers in the port.</p><h4>What impact will the Panama Canal expansion have on the Dominican logistics industry?</h4><p>The canal expansion will help us because it will increase the traffic of goods; however, it is a challenge, too. In the same way, we must ensure our regulatory environment, because Panama has many laws that assist companies not based in Panama. So, it is not only the expansion of the canal, it is also the integration of policy that must be checked. Yobel grows in Panama by approximately 30% yearly, which is a huge figure. In the Dominican Republic, we grow by 20%-25% annually, which presents an opportunity, although it is a challenge for the country to maintain its competitive advantage in the region.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Constructora Rizek has over 40 years of experience in the Dominican market. How has the company evolved since its foundation and in which sectors are you most active?<br></h4><p>Constructora Rizek is a market leader in the construction industry in the Dominican Republic. We have vast experience of over 40 years of continuous service in the country. Our success is built on three pillars: quality work, efficiency in delivery times, and competitive prices for construction services. Constructora Rizek has high-level resources for the execution of its projects. Our engineering team has vast experience in planning and execution, and we have specialized in the construction of roads and housing for many years. We now plan to start actively developing commercial projects as well.</p><h4>What are some of the key projects you are currently involved in?</h4><p>The Santo Domingo ring road is the most important highway project in the country, as it impacts both Santo Domingo as and the broader country. It connects all main Santo Domingo roads, and is a long-awaited project and we are extremely proud about our involvement in it. The project is divided in two parts, and we are involved in the second, a 36-km section set for partial completion in February 2015. The Dominican government finances the project. The Southern Highway Corridor is another of the main projects we are currently developing. This project is being financed by the International Development Bank (IADB) and involves the reconstruction of over 120 km of the road that links the Dominican Republic with Haiti.</p><h4>Could you talk about the Barrick Gold project?</h4><p>We participated as one of the first contractors, taking on considerable responsibility. Quality, safety, and timing were the main drivers of this project, and these considerations were met despite our working 24/7 in shifts to complete it. We learned a lot from this project, as it came from a major Canadian mining company, which insisted on meeting extremely high standards. Thanks to our work we have contributed to a wide range of economic sectors in our country: mining, road, housing, and also tourism, among others. We were part of the construction team building the Punta Cana Airport, constructing the taxiway and landing strips. This project involved the implementation of new technologies to meet the demands of the project and its tight deadlines. We also have several other projects within the tourism industry.</p><h4>How do you ensure the use of high quality machinery?</h4><p>We managed to impress Barrick Gold engineers with the high quality level of our machinery, as we use the latest and most advanced technology in the industry and this sets us apart from the competition. We recently implemented GPS system technology in our excavators, so when using it, excavators know what they need to do with no need to rely on topographic measurements. This tool makes the work more efficient and raises the quality level. Before, you needed four people plus the driver, but with this new system, only the driver is needed.</p><h4>How do you assess the workforce of the sector?</h4><p>There are no institutions or education and training centers for our industry in the Dominican Republic. People are not sufficiently prepared for the work at hand, which is why we provide training. We have a highly experienced operations manager, who is the main person involved in training our workers. Training is also related to safety, so we have developed our own training resources.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the development of the infrastructure sector in the Dominican Republic, and what role do public-private partnerships (PPPs) play in that context?</h4><p>PPPs are the future of the sector; however, the country is yet to fully exploit the benefits of them, despite some successful cases in the construction of maritime and airport facilities. The implementation of these project schemes requires time and PPPs will definitely become a useful tool in the country, especially for the development of infrastructure projects. There have also been positive steps regarding the regulatory framework for these projects.</p><h4>What are the greatest challenges facing the infrastructure industry in the Dominican Republic and what is your outlook for its future?</h4><p>We need to raise the level of security on our roads, as we have a number of dangerous highways. We also need to amend current legislation, as another major challenge for the country is the rapid urban development of cities. Dominican cities require considerable additional services and infrastructure.</p><h4>How would you assess the overall investment environment in the country?</h4><p>Political and economic stability are on the rise, as is legal security for investors. The government supports and respects private investment, and I believe that the investment environment today is better than ever.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-mine-of-experience]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Center for Export and Investment of the Dominican Republic (CEI-RD) and The Mining Management Office of the Dominican Republic have recently agreed to work together in identifying potential new markets that could positively impact the national mining sector. Could you outline the specifics of this agreement?<br></h4><p>The Mining Management Office of the Dominican Republic closed an agreement with the CEI-RD in order to create synergies to boost FDI in the mining sector. We are the public organization in charge of managing the legal framework of the national mining industry. Therefore, all investors must obtain mining licenses from us. Investors do this directly after reaching the CEI-RD, which is why we signed the partnership to boost synergies between both institutions. Our activity does much to simplify mining investment, by reducing bureaucratic barriers.</p><h4>Which minerals have the greatest importance for the Dominican Republic, and which regions benefit the most from those deposits?</h4><p>The Dominican Republic has a highly developed mining industry, in particular in terms of its gold segment with the Pueblo Viejo mine, located approximately 100km northwest of the capital city of Santo Domingo, in the Sánchez Ramirez Province; the nickel segment through Falcondo, situated in the town of Bonao, 80km north of Santo Domingo; and the copper segment through Cerro de Maimon, located 70km northwest of Santo Domingo, both in the Monseñor Nouel Province. We also have a gold recovery unit, Las Lagunas, and bauxite production—we export considerably through the Port of Cabo Rojo (Pedernales) to China. At the port, there is a large operation for the mining industry in terms of infrastructure and vessels. We also have some other mining explorations with GoldQuest, which discovered a significant gold deposit in San Juan Province and has already engaged exploring activities, and the company Precipitate Gold, with another gold discovery in the same province. Unigold currently develops mining prospects for gold and copper in the Dajabon Province, near the border with Haiti. In terms of non-metallic mining activity, we are a leading producer of Portland cement in the Caribbean; we have seven cement production plants and installed capacity exceeds domestic demand, making room for considerable export. I could also mention our activity in the semiprecious stones segment with larimar, a unique stone in our country, for which we have developed a craftsman school, as well as amber in the municipality of El Valle, Hato Mayor, and Puerto Plata, the latter two being the most traditional. We have a good production of blue amber in those regions, which is highly valued by the market, fetching over $3,000 per ounce.</p><h4>How would you characterize the current investment climate in the Dominican Republic's mining sector?</h4><p>I believe it is excellent, especially since the government provides full support to foreign investors through a network of public institutions that help foreign investors arrive in the country and set up operations. Our institution works toward providing regulatory advice to investors as well as to make sure their investment is as profitable as possible. We promote the Dominican mining industry, and the benefits of its regulatory framework at international events in Canada, Australia, and Switzerland. The most important need currently is to identify potential areas of foreign investment. For example, the government asked us to identify the areas of the country in which mining rights were not currently exploited. This stands to both ease and expedite the arrival of foreign investors. We also manage exploration requests, and have denied over 140 to date as those companies were not considered fully dedicated to the mining industry.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What technologies has Laurus introduced to increase its agents productivity and customer satisfaction?<br></h4><p>When we acquire a new client, we do not initially focus on productivity or quality initiatives. Every client and program is unique, and we need to understand the program. Hence, we normally contractually agree that we own the program for the first 90, days during which time we develop an understanding for the company, its customers and the program. Once we gain insights into the program and identify areas of opportunity, either in efficiency or quality, we apply our strengths in customer care and technical support experience to develop solutions. We have highly experienced development and IT teams that have designed and developed automation solutions that eliminate handling time in the majority of cases, and operate an internal process to monitor quality. In our experience, US clients want quality first and efficiency a close second. We have developed software, and hardware with special keyboards, that allow quicker access to key systems and information for our agents. Beyond technology and innovation, we also invest heavily in our employees through our recruiting and retention initiatives. We have the lowest rate of attrition for both English and Spanish-speaking agents.</p><h4>What is the average profile of your workers?</h4><p>Around 58% of our workers are female, which is not common in the Dominican Republic as most call centers in general, employ primarily men. We want to change this, and we believe that by having more women in our centers, we can encourage strong work ethics, respect, productivity, and challenge the current culture that dominates in many industries. Laurus International offers equal work and career opportunities for everybody. Another interesting consideration is the number of students who join us straight from universities. Approximately 30% of our employees are students. Many of these workers join and remain with us because they discover call centers offer excellent careers and financial opportunities unmatched in other industries with similar experience. It is difficult to find a job in the Dominican Republic that pays Ps30,000 or more. In the summer, with overtime, people were making up to Ps90,000 a month, which is uncommon. However, it is not just about money. Laurus is an enjoyable place to work with excellent benefits and advancement opportunities.</p><h4>What differentiates Laurus International from other call centers?</h4><p>There are several elements that set us apart from other companies. The largest loss in a call center is the attrition. In every call center worldwide you will find the same thing; a huge building full of people, but just a couple of people in HR. We took a different route, and rented space initially from multiple call centers to compare working models. Then, we built our call centers in a different way. We saw a need in the areas of recruiting, managing, retaining, and rewarding employees. Ultimately, the industry's primary asset is its human capital. We set up Working Bees, our HR department, as an integrated but separate division focused solely on recruitment, retention, and employee development. It is housed in a separate building and maintains responsibility for all recruiting and retention of our employees. We have a 90-day guarantee period for every new recruit, meaning if they are fired before this time, the HR department gets a reduced bonus. Our dedication and focus on constant improvement makes us the most respected and best performing call center in the region. We also offer the best healthcare plan available, and have three fully bilingual doctors on rotation from 6:00 am to 5.30 pm seven days a week. We have our own pharmacy, so not only is there a doctor free of charge, but we also have the medicines available immediately. Another area we are exploring is food. Our goal is to give free food to employees during work time. At the moment, we provide half of their meals.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Maritima Dominicana has recently met with the Vice-President of the US, Joseph Biden, to discuss the details of the initiative supporting the production of renewable energy. What is the importance of having such support, and what is your view on the transformation of the energy sector in the Dominican Republic?<br></h4><p>The shipping sector is looking at options to provide more environmentally acceptable vessel fuels. Maritima Dominicana, as a service provider to both the shipping industry and local industry, is also focused on more efficient energy production, and ways in which we can provide our own services, for example warehousing, in a more environmentally acceptable way. This is why, three years ago, we were the first company to install solar panels on the roof of our warehouse. The US Vice President wanted to have a look at those because the message to the whole country is that everyone should focus on environmental initiatives. We are also ISO14001 and ISO40001 certified as part of our efforts to protect the environment.</p><h4>In 2014 you mentioned that Maritima Dominicana planned to expand its business to supply chain management. How far has this initiative advanced, and to what extent do you want to expand your services?</h4><p>We have been working on that subject for the last 12 months. Caucedo Port, which is next to the airport, is going to construct a logistic free zone to facilitate supply chain management, and to help Caucedo become a hub for the supply of materials and merchandise to the eastern Caribbean for both ships and airplanes. It is similar to Dubai, which has become an important hub in the Middle East because you can send spare parts, materials, and merchandise, both by ship and plane. The implementation of the new logistic free zone will be in 2015, which is something we are looking forward to. Furthermore, the transformation of the customs legal structure that we have been discussing with the government intensely over the past 12 months will be brought in too.</p><h4>Maritima Dominicana has recently participated in the leading international maritime trade fair in Hamburg. What is the significance of these kinds of events for the development of the sector and for recognition of the Dominican Republic internationally?</h4><p>The Hamburg event that is held every two years is focused on shipbuilding, ship repairs, and the sale of spare parts to the shipping sector. In the case of the Dominican Republic, we have our ship repair yard, Ciramar Shipyards, and that has a stand at the Hamburg fair. We have quite a number of ships that are being repaired at Ciramar; hence, there is an important relationship between them, as the ship repair facility and us as the ship agent. Facilitating this relationship is always an important aspect of our work and this is what we did when we were in Hamburg. And, in 2014 the event had the largest number of companies attending and the largest number of visitors ever. This was partly because the challenge of transforming the propulsion systems of ships from heavy fuel to other alternatives was being discussed and that is quite complicated technology.</p><h4>Does that mean that you are seeing a regional and international willingness to address these new challenges?</h4><p>Absolutely, because under new shipping  laws countries' ship owners and companies  will have to comply with these requirements and, therefore they will have to find solutions to be able to comply. And this is a challenge because the conversion of a traditional compulsion system to the new system involves difficult technology. Not only that, but right now the US and Europe have very few LNG terminals that provide the fuel; therefore, ships that call at the larger ports such as Bremen, Hamburg, and Rotterdam cannot find the fuel that they need. The suppliers themselves are also facing a challenge. Hamburg Port in Germany is the first port to purchase an LNG barge to supply this fuel to shipping lines.</p><h4>A challenge that many shipping companies have expressed concerns about is the negative balance of trade in the Dominican Republic. What is your view on this situation and how does it affect the industry?</h4><p>With a balanced trade a country has the most competitive freight rates in the market. For every three containers, we import, we only export one in return, which means that two containers have to be shipped back out empty.  And, that means the income for the shipping lines for these two empty containers is non-existent. It is just a cost. Therefore, the struggle for each nation to balance its trade is an opportunity to be more competitive. They are looking for incentives, particularly in connection with the legal structure, so that the Dominican Republic, its free zones, and its agricultural producers, can export more volume compared to what we have done in the past, and reach a more balanced exchange of trade.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>E.T. Heinsen SAS celebrates its 90th anniversary in 2014. What do you consider the company's landmark achievement?<br></h4><p>The main landmark has been the transfer of control within the family to the fourth generation. That alone is quite an achievement and something that is looked up to by the many companies that struggle to survive beyond the first generation of ownership. The strength of our company stems from our people, which today are a world away from the previous generation in technological terms.</p><h4>What is your own experience of the Dominican Republic's 2014 economic performance?</h4><p>From our perspective, we expect to be ready for the Canal expansion, as we have the Caucedo Port investing at least $200 million over the next four years, which will enable it to manage large vessels over 350 feet in length. Further good news is that the shipping sector is working on appropriate laws or decrees allowing us to become a more competitive market even than Panama or Colombia. The new laws will allow goods to enter the country in certain areas tax-free and be exported without incurring additional fees. Moreover, when you consider north/south business, the Dominican Republic is between Brazil and Argentina, and the US and Canada, which means considerable traffic going from north to south, which could easily stop here and distribute goods into Central America, by taking advantage of the transshipment port. And when considering Europe and the Dominican Republic, you see that the first port of call to any service between the two continents is the Dominican Republic, which is also an attractive proposition for transshipments.</p><h4>The Dominican Association of Air and Maritime Shipping Agents (ADACAM) and the Shipping Association of the Dominican Republic (ANRD) are considering the formation of a transportation logistics cluster. Can you talk us through this idea?</h4><p>We are exploring this idea closely, and have tasked an international expert to provide a thorough perspective of what a cluster should be, and which cluster we should try to become. The National Association of Consolidators and Freight Forwarders is interested, as is the government and, of course, ourselves. We hope to see the cluster up and running in 1H2015.</p><h4>E.T. Heinsen, through sister company Transporte Impala, also provides inland transport services. What importance do you give to that part of the business?</h4><p>The biggest problem in the Dominican Republic with regards to logistics is the monopoly on in-land transportation. We are not members of Fenatrado and can distribute in containers and chassis anywhere in the Dominican Republic. Soon, we will enter other markets, and are already building our strategy accordingly, and also undertaking local distribution between industries. Industries that engage heavily in distribution are trying to outsource their transportation, which is why we provide a truck and personnel exclusively for them, and they ultimately save money.</p><h4>What are Heinsen's current development strategy and key objectives for 2015?</h4><p>For 2015, we forecast generating at least 15% greater revenue than today. The primary goal is to keep costs low, increase productivity, and register better results. But each individual line of our business has its own goals. In the shipping and transportation sectors, we want to expand and post a better bottom-line. At the airports, we want additional representation from the US.</p><p>On the logistics side, we are keen to enter more into warehousing, which is important, as it is a totally new business line. Meanwhile, we are a major stakeholder in the Port of Rio Haina, and are not only upgrading operational software, but also expanding our capacity as a logistics operator. For example, grain coming from New Orleans to the Dominican Republic in huge bulk carriers is actually discharged in a well-mechanized system that bags and stores it in the warehouse, or directs it to containers, and from this port, we are distributing bagged grain worldwide.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<p>The Dominican Republic is achieving new and transcendental conquests. We have taken great strides that help our citizens to achieve new levels of independence. We are making efforts to ensure that their rights are recognized, so that the same access to opportunities and progress may be achieved for all of our citizens. We are progressing continuously so that all Dominicans can enjoy true freedom; the sort of freedom that only comes about when a nation lives without fear, without poverty, and without ignorance. With the fulfillment of the commitments and goals that Dominicans demand and deserve, we have strengthened the most important link that can unite a government with the people: trust. In this way, we have seen growth and development, as we had promised, and the greatest transformation of the Dominican Republic in its recent history.</p><p>Our greatest task has been to open doors and eliminate the barriers to building a country for all—a nation where no one is left behind. And we have accomplished this because of that inner unstoppable force that is only possible when the government and the people advance hand in hand in the same direction. We are, together, creating a greater Dominican Republic, because our nation will be stronger with our people more united, and more involved in building the country's future. The projects and works that this government has launched have been many, and we will initiate many more for the duration of the present term. Along this road, we have kept a cool head to take the best decisions, even amidst strong pressures. But we have also placed our heart into forcefully defending our national sovereignty and the interests of the Dominican people when it has been necessary. The government is fully dedicated to setting the base for a new phase in our country's history, and in building a Dominican Republic for all. This is the most important message that I want to communicate today. We are committed to a development model where people, families, and communities are at the center of all policies. We have committed ourselves to placing the economy at the service of the people and never the other way around, and to create an economic fabric that is less vulnerable and more capable of producing goods and services. As I said earlier, overcoming social exclusion and progressing toward equality is the social revolution that is needed and possible in today's Dominican Republic. It is the battle for true independence that we need to wage in the 21st century. The time has come for universal access to progress and guaranteed rights for the vast majority of those who have been excluded, but who live in harmony with responsibility and respect for the law.</p><h4>LEARNING CURVE</h4><p>In the Dominican Republic we are experiencing an authentic educational revolution. For a long time quality education has been a privilege that only those with purchasing power could afford. And so, the hopes of millions of poor families for the future of their children were relegated to oblivion. But we all know that quality public education is the most powerful tool we have in our hands to ensure that all children, regardless of their social origin, have access to the same opportunities. We needed to break down these barriers, and after we first met the promise to allocate 4% of GDP to education, we called on society as a whole to participate in a broad Education Pact, to make everyone a stakeholder in ensuring that the budget allocation, penny by penny, funds the kind of quality education we want. This process, with the participation of thousands of contributions from organizations, professionals, students, and citizens, has shown us that Dominicans are determined to raise the flag of education to the highest point in the Republic. In parallel, we decided to undertake what has been the greatest expansion of school infrastructure in the country's history. To achieve this, we have made progress in the construction of more than 10,000 classrooms, dining rooms and their corresponding kitchens. In addition, to ensure that all students are well fed with nutritious food, we have doubled the budget for the procurement of these foods from local producers.</p><p>In 2014, the Ministry of Science and Higher Education and Technology has awarded more than 20,000 scholarships for higher learning. Among these, more than 18,000 disadvantaged youths received scholarships to study at local universities. But we could not talk about the education revolution without mentioning our teachers. I assure you that we will always be at the side of teachers, who are the soul of this educational revolution. We are committed to promoting authentic recognition of the dignity of their work, and we have already taken significant steps in this direction. The first of these steps was to provide for the greatest wage increase that has been assigned to this group in the past 15 years, and that, on average, involves a raise of 40%. This means the days of poverty wages in our schools are over. We have provided a historic raise in the pensions of retired teachers, in appreciation of their years of dedication to education. As far as teacher training concerns, we have been aware that a considerable effort was needed for this to meet international quality standards. All Dominicans are uniting around this education revolution. This is especially evident when considering the success the literacy plan “Quisqueya Learns With You" has already had. We are getting closer to overcoming illiteracy in our country for ever. What a year ago seemed like a dream is now a reality with thousands of men and women now able to read and write, a scheme we continue to pursue.</p><h4>HEALTHY PROSPECTS</h4><p>Another area that is also essential in breaking the barriers of inequality and exclusion is public health. For too long we have accepted that families with fewer resources remain at the mercy of their fate or charity when an illness or accident brings tragedy home. To ensure free and universal access to health services, as an inalienable right for all Dominicans, we are committed to developing a single network of Public Health Services, to extending social security services to all, and to improving facilities and services under the subsidized health regime. Our target is to provide 100% medical care coverage of the population under the subsidized scheme. Another great barrier we have taken down that impeded access to health for poor people is the recovery quota at public hospitals. A government fund of 352 million pesos has ensured that worrying about payment for services rendered will no longer be an issue when seeking care at a public hospital. We have also worked to reach out to groups of patients that traditionally had difficulty in accessing the care they needed. To this end, we have allocated 2 billion pesos for a Catastrophic Illness Fund, as pledged. This has meant that 8,900 patients have not had to face the high cost of their specific drugs alone. The same has been the case with HIV-AIDS patients, who are now guaranteed free treatment, for which an investment of over RD$79 million in anti-retrovirals has been made. Vaccination coverage exceeds 95%, and our country can be regarded as free of illnesses such as diphtheria, neonatal tetanus, wild poliovirus, measles, rubella syndrome, and congenital rubella. In terms of new health infrastructure, we are taking great strides to bring it closer to the people, with 34 new primary care units scattered nationwide.</p><p>While all of these indicators are important, perhaps the most profound change we are making in the area of health is the least visible, namely the transformation of the care model. The creation of the Single Network Health Services and the decentralization it will bring will mean that in the near future it will not be the patient who approaches the healthcare system, but the healthcare system that reaches out to our people. Human capital is a central element in this process, as we know that the essence of a successful health system lies in the people.</p><p>As part of this initiative to bring health to our people, to date, an investment of more than Pe57 million has been made to hire 1,500 health promoters, who are leading prevention and education campaigns to bring information on healthy habits to all corners of our country. We have made significant progress in one of our main objectives for the government and the country. Improvements in obstetrics emergency services have seen a reduction in child mortality of 18%, and maternal mortality of 4%. In addition, we have other positive indicators for mothers and children, including the steady decline in child malnutrition that has enabled us to meet the Millennium Development Goal for this area, and the inclusion of rotavirus and pneumococcus vaccines in the national vaccination plan—both of vital importance to the protection of children.</p><h4>YOUTHFUL OUTLOOK</h4><p>We are proud that our country has been chosen by the Ibero-American Youth Organization as the Ibero-American Youth Capital, in recognition of the projects underway by the country's youth, as in the case of Young Community, a struggle against illiteracy, and pursuant of job placement, widespread participation, and public policy processes. In 2014, the Ministry of Youth has made significant progress in the formation of the National Youth System, which already brings together 25,000 young people in 70 municipalities nationwide.</p><p>The government has proposed that no-one be left behind. This is the government by all, with all, and for all. The best part of this project has yet to come. We will continue to build together, and will continue meeting goals, transforming the Dominican Republic, and showing the world that we can do what has never been done before.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the Dominican Republic has increased in 245.5% in the last decade. What factors drove that expansion and what are the sectors with the greatest potential?<br></h4><p>FDI, over the last decade, went from $ 7.684 million in 2004 to $26,549,000 at the end of 2013, an increase of $18,865,000, an increase of 245.5% in 10 years. This significant increase represents an average annual flow around $ 2,000 million. The main factors that have influenced this increase in FDI are:</p><p>• The country's macroeconomic stability characterized by sustained economic growth, low inflation and relative stability of the exchange rate and a healthy financial, liquid, solvent and well capitalized system.</p><p>• The FDI Act provides facilities and guarantees to foreign investors, equal to the Dominicans, which gives legal security, with clear rules and regulations with incentives for investors in different sectors.</p><p>• In addition, we have political stability and social peace, marked by a rule of law that prevails in free enterprise and democratic rule of long standing.</p><p>• The geographical location the country enjoys, and central proximity to the US, a feature that makes it an excellent destination for FDI.</p><p>• The country's participation in major trade agreements like DR-CAFTA, the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) with the EU, among others, makes us an investment destination that can take advantage of these agreements.</p><p>• The existence of an excellent road, port and airport infrastructure network, the latter with 8 international airports.</p><p>• A world class telecommunications system.</p><p>Diversification in target sectors of FDI is another factor that has contributed to the increase in investment flows. In 2000, four sectors, Electric energy, Telecommunications, Trade and Tourism, accounted for 82% of FDI. Thirteen years later (2013) the spectrum of sectors expanded, appearing with great preponderance additional sectors such as: Real Estate, Construction and Finance. Of the sectors, to our knowledge, that has great potential for future growths for foreign investment are mining, agriculture, energy and tourism.</p><h4>What has been the impact of the normalization of the US monetary policy in the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>Undoubtedly, the process of normalization of US monetary policy will influence in an increase of interest rates internationally, affecting capital flows and changing liquidity conditions that have operated in the international financial markets during years. The Dominican Republic is no exception to this international reality. However, we understand that the country is better prepared to face any effect arising from this situation, given the early stage of development of our capital markets and strong fundamentals of our economy, as evidenced in 2013 with the first indications of the Federal Reserve United States that would be a withdrawal of monetary stimulus. The behavior of markets, at that time, showed that internationally the Dominican economy is linked to the group of emerging economies with sound macroeconomic fundamentals, as is the case in Colombia, Chile, Mexico, and Peru in Latin America. In addition, several studies in international organizations like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) suggest that the effects of this normalization would be different in two groups of countries in Latin America. For example, countries that in addition to the US as their main trading partner and have an incipient development of their financial markets, among which are Dominican Republic, tend to benefit more from the real effects of monetary normalization, given the highest economic growth in the US, what could be affected by the tightening of international financial conditions. However, the central bank remains aware of these events to react in time when the balance of risks points to possible deviations from its inflation target and thus take the necessary measures to ensure the maintenance of macroeconomic stability in our country.</p><h4>What is your evaluation of the level of assets and deposits of Dominican banks in 2014?</h4><p>As of August 2014, total assets of Financial Intermediation Institutions totaled Ps1,142,723 million, a nominal growth rate of 8.6% (an increase of Ps90.915 million), relative to the amount recorded on the same date the year before. If you compare this August to December 2013, assets totaled Ps54.074 million, ie 5.0%. This growth is mainly explained by the behavior of the loan portfolio, which in August this year totaled Ps667,927,000, a variation of 12.5%. Significantly, of the total loans of the financial sector, commercial banks concentrated 86.9%. Indeed, the loan portfolio of multiple banks totaled Ps586,693.2 million in August 2014, a variation of 12.8%. Meanwhile, public deposits in the financial sector in August 2014 reached a total of Ps935.674 million, an annual increase of 10.4%, equivalent to Ps87,762,000.</p><p>The domestic currency deposits grew faster compared to the same period of the previous year, 12.9%; while foreign currency deposits increased by only 3.6%. In August 2014, the share of domestic currency deposits in total deposits in the financial system was 74.6%, up 1.7 percentage ratio to that shown in August 2013 (72.9%) points, reflecting a decline in the share of foreign currency deposits, which went from 27.1% to 25.4% during the period. An important element worth noting is the fact that during the period August 2013 to August 2014, Financial Intermediaries decreased their exposure to credit risk by maintaining the downward trend in its NPL ratio, which went from 2.9% to 2.2%, driven by lower coefficients shown in commercial banks and savings and loans.</p><p>In particular, multiple banking delinquencies rates fell from 2.9% to 1.9% and provision coverage of nonperforming loans increased from 117.0% to 164.3 percent. Overall, the Dominican financial system has adequate liquidity, profitability and capital strengthening. The solvency ratio remained above the 10% minimum required, reaching 18.18% in July 2014, last available figure, while the return on assets (ROA) and average equity (ROE) for August was 2.02% and 18.33% respectively in the same month. Commercial Banks showed levels of 2.05% ROA and ROE of 21.45%. This behavior of the entities of the Dominican financial system is mainly due to the implementation of bylaws and regulations, by the Monetary Board, in line with the Basel core principles and international best practices.</p><h4>In the recently celebrated Invest in DR Summit, the central bank estimated that the national economy would grow between 5.5% and 6% in 2014, quadrupling Latin American growth. What are the main growth drivers?</h4><p>During the period January-June 2014, the performance of the Dominican economy as measured by Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in real terms (reference year 2007), recorded an annual increase of 7.2%. This trend allows forecasting growth for the year 2014 between 5.5% and 6.0%, higher than originally envisaged in the macroeconomic framework of a real GDP growth of 4.5%. The driving forces of economic growth expected for 2014 are agricultural, mining, construction, trade and hotels, bars and restaurants, due to the dynamism exhibited since late last year. In the case of Latin America, Consensus Forecast predicts average growth of 1.4% for 2014, figures that have been revised downwards during the year due to decreases in estimates of growth in several of the largest economies the region, such as Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Argentina and Venezuela. For the last two year changes in Real GDP at end-2014 of -1.6% and -2.6% respectively are forecast, reducing the average growth in the region.</p><h4>What are the main policies the Central Bank is to implement in 2015 to boost investment and commerce?</h4><p>The central bank's policies to encourage investment are aimed at ensuring macroeconomic stability, which the country enjoys. In this sense, from January 2012, the central bank adopted an Inflation Targeting Scheme as a transparent and modern way to make monetary policy, consistent with the mandate of maintaining price stability established in the Constitution of the Republic and the Monetary and Financial Law 183-02. Under this scheme, the central bank will continue its proactive and vigilant monetary policy of external and internal shocks that may affect its inflation target, maintaining proper coordination with fiscal policy, in order to promote certainty for economic operators and a climate favorable investment. Another important aspect is to ensure relative exchange rate stability under the managed floating exchange rate regime that the country possesses. For this, the central bank will continue to monitor fluctuations in the exchange rate, so that when sudden movements act are verified in the rate that may affect the expectations of economic agents, and ensuring that the real exchange rate, as so far, stay aligned with the macro fundamentals of the Dominican economy.</p><h4>What's your general outlook for the economy of the Dominican Republic in 2015?</h4><p>According to estimates of Macroeconomic Framework, the Dominican economy would grow at around 5.0% in 2015, with an inflation rate that point to the center of the target range of 4.0% ± 1% of the central bank. This is accompanied by a relative stability of exchange rate, since the strengthening of international reserves that are expected to hold a minimum of 3 months of imports of goods and services associated with larger flows of foreign exchange by the improved performance of the external sector. Indeed, in a preliminary way, the projections indicate that by 2015 deficit on current account is expected around 4.0% of GDP, and future estimates downward, in line with the historical average of 3.5%.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize the Dominican Republic's capital market in comparison to other countries in the region?<br></h4><p>The Dominican Republic has a deep fixed income capital market, yet we lack activity in the equity market, which differentiates us from other countries within the region. However, given recently developed regulatory frameworks, the Dominican Republic will be entering a new growth phase expected to boost a stronger development of the local equity capital market. In 2013, for example, we had the first Closed-Ended Fund trading on the exchange, and we are expecting several other listings of mutual funds and investments trusts throughout the coming months. In terms of common equity public offerings, this year the securities regulators approved the first ever IPO, which is expected to be traded on the Exchange by early 2015. Moreover, there is an interesting pipeline of large market-cap companies soliciting approval to go public in 2015. Likewise, we are excited about the prospect of several government sponsored entities attempting to source financing for specific infrastructure projects through the equity markets.</p><p>It is a financing model that we have observed in countries like Russia, Turkey, Colombia, and Chile, which prompt the development of their local capital markets while achieving an efficient capital budgeting for project financing. Furthermore, we strongly support this type of initiative, which confirms the government's commitment to the promotion of the capital markets, as a means to achieve  sound economic growth and development.</p><h4>What activities is the BVRD currently focusing on?</h4><p>The exchange has a three-pronged strategy focusing on providing state-of-the-art infrastructure, engaging in developing new markets/services and taking on significant efforts to improve the investment culture in the Dominican Republic. Within the strategy, we are focused on new and existing issuers, our market participants, and local and international investors. In 2014, we successfully launched a new state-of-the-art trading platform that will help develop new products and markets as well provide broker-dealers with straight-through-processing in the trading, clearing and settlement value chain. We have also launched the first official Dominican government bond index (GOBIX) which will help investors get a real-time sentiment of the fixed-income market and structure new products and investment vehicles. On the primary market, we were concerned with the lack of significant growth given the nascent state of our market; therefore, over the past year, we have developed a join program with the International Finance Corporation (IFC/World Bank) to promote best practices of corporate governance in Dominican companies, and provide those companies with training in finance, strategy, and the possibility of going public, among other topics. During the second half of the year, fixed income issuance has more than doubled the yearly amounts accounted in prior years, and we feel that 2015 should be a year of significant growth as well.</p><h4>In April 2014, the Dominican Republic sold a record volume of bonds, at $1.25 billion of securities due in 2044 at a yield of 7.45%. What is the significance of this sale for overall national development and what sectors will benefit the most?</h4><p>When you look back 15 years, the longest part of the local yield curve in the Dominican Republic was less than a year, and local investors were not willing to go further into the yield curve. Nowadays, the government has been issuing bonds at thirty years, in the global markets and up to 15 years of maturity in the domestic market, at historical low yields, which is being impressive given the recent evolution of the Dominican capital market. These bonds are trading above par and with a spread over treasuries tighter than those of many countries in the region, demonstrating a positive surge of investor's confidence in the stability of the political and macroeconomic outlook of the Dominican Republic. In addition, the country's economic performance over the past decade has been widely recognized, attracting a more sustainable FDI flow. Correspondingly, these global bonds are being used as a market gauge to define the cost of capital for many projects in the Dominican Republic, allowing investors to have a better benchmark to define trading opportunities in the local market.</p><h4>How dependent is the Dominican economy on international trends?</h4><p>The financial crisis in the US did not hit us hard. We suffered in terms of real estate because potential clients lacked the income to buy a second or third home in the Caribbean. That type of activity might be affected, but in terms of growth and stability we have made significant advances. Our financial industry is stronger than 10 years ago and public financial and monetary policy is focused on achieving the right balance between growth and inflation. However, we are sensitive to foreign exchange fluctuations give our net importer position. Nevertheless, I believe we are reasonably isolated from those global shifts. Finally, our dependence on oil and on contracts with entities such as PetroCaribe are being constantly monitored to determine the potential impact on the economy as a whole.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>The Dominican Republic is well known throughout Europe. More than 1 million of our citizens visit this beautiful country every year, and many have chosen to live there. They go to the Dominican Republic for its stunning scenery, historical sites, and the well known Dominican hospitality. I went to there to mark the importance the European Union attaches to its relations with the country, and by extension, to its relations with the Caribbean and Central America.<br></p><p>The Dominican Republic enjoys a double affiliation. It is an active member of the Central American Integration System (SICA), and as such contributes to its integration process. Equally, it is an important actor within the Caribbean, notably through the Caribbean Forum (CARIFORUM). As an innovator of regional integration processes, the EU is convinced of the virtues of systematic regional cooperation, based on the acknowledgement of common interests, as a means to overcome rivalries, defeat challenges, and generate prosperity. There is no doubt that the Dominican Republic plays a crucial bridge-building role between Central America, the Caribbean, and Europe.</p><p>The 25th anniversary of Dominican accession to the Cotonou agreement offers an unparalleled occasion to highlight these facts and give renewed impetus to our relations. These are the questions I reviewed with President Medina during my visit, and we noted that our bilateral relationship was based on a joint commitment to democracy and human rights. We have agreed to continue nourishing it through regular political dialogue. We have also agreed that the Economic Partnership Agreement, signed between the EU and CARIFORUM, should be utilized in order to promote the trade and investments that are so important for the future of the country. The National Indicative Programme for cooperation, which we have just signed, adds further substance to these efforts, most notably through its support for education and vocational training as a means of contributing to social integration. In addition, we have seen that important challenges require improved regional and inter-regional cooperation. I am referring concretely to the fight against organized crime and the strengthening of resilience in the face of natural disasters, including those produced by climate change. With this very purpose the EU has just finalized a “Strategy on Citizen Security in Central America and the Caribbean."</p><p>The tragedy experienced by Haiti in 2010 put our regional and international solidarity to the test. Without doubt, the Dominican Republic responded swiftly and was among the first to offer support, demonstrating the goodwill and sympathy of the Dominican people. The European Union and its member states were also quick to follow, and billions of euros worth of international assistance have been invested over the past four years in humanitarian support and reconstruction efforts in Haiti. No country can be more concerned about the future of Haiti, nor can benefit more from its stability, and a re-launch of its economic growth, than its closest neighbor, the Dominican Republic. As an important partner of both countries, the EU remains ready to assist in the strengthening of Haitian-Dominican relations.</p><p>The EU was honored to have been invited to participate in this bilateral dialogue as an active observer. It brings to the table its long experience in regional cooperation and in cementing reconciliation and friendship among neighboring countries. This is the essence of the EU. We wholeheartedly support this dialogue; it has the potential to bring greater regional stability and shared prosperity for the benefit of both countries and their peoples. The EU is ready to step up its action, as and when our Dominican and Haitian friends take further steps in their cooperation. We as the union match our words with deeds by providing substantial financial support to bilateral cooperation in areas such as economic development, infrastructure links, public health, and the environment.</p><p>The Dominican Republic and Haiti have already reached bilateral agreements to improve security, combat drug trafficking, protect natural resources, and stimulate trade. The EU is ready to share its experience on migration, customs, border management, trade, health, and the environment to continue providing assistance for the implementation of the agreements reached in the framework of the high-level bilateral dialog, as it merits our support. The European Union will continue to support both states in their efforts to enhance cooperation and deepen their neighborly relationship.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the average profile of ADOEXPO's members and how do you attract the companies to join?<br></h4><p>Our membership is made up of a diverse set of small, medium, and large export companies, as well as associations and federations of different export sectors of our country, including the agricultural, industrial, and services sectors. To attract these companies, we perform activities to support the sector, such as trade shows, seminars, training, lunch-conferences, and other events. These serve not only to make ADOEXPO better known, but also to promote the growth of Dominican exports. Among the benefits we offer to affiliates are the financing of services to exporters or companies with export potential through PRO-EXPORTA POPULAR, a program in partnership with Banco Popular Dominicano, which allows clients to get to know the steps involved in successfully completing the export process with specialized support, prime rate financing for the acquisition of machinery and raw materials, collection services and the transfer of international remittances.</p><h4>What are the main highlights of the training program for entrepreneurs that was initiated by ADOEXPO and the National Institute of Technical Training (Infotep)?</h4><p>The main objective of the interagency agreement signed in August 2014 is to strengthen and improve inductions in our ADOEXPO Training Program, through the intervention of facilitators with the kinds of advanced teaching skills that our teachers from INFOTEP have. Likewise, through this program, our members have as a facility to receive inductions in-house, for all employees in the different courses and technical careers that allow them to build capacity, improve processes, and achieve more to become more competitive entities. In principle the trainings conducted under this agreement such as the Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) and International Negotiation Strategies are most of interest to our membership. We have established this from the results of surveys carried out to ascertain their needs for continuous improvement of the export of goods and services. Even though the Dominican Republic is strategically located in the center of the Americas, and has signed trade agreements that provide privileged market access to the US, Europe, Central America, and the Caribbean, the country has a persistently negative balance of trade. I believe that our trade deficit is the result of several factors, including the low level of emphasis placed on the promotion of an export culture in our country. We are importing more than we export and we are a country with great potential, not only because of our climate and its fertile soil, but also because of our geographical location in the center of the Caribbean.</p><h4>The Dominican Republic is a member of the Association of Caribbean States, which set the development of greater trade between the nations as one of its primary goals. Has the Dominican Republic fully exploited the potential coming from this agreement?</h4><p>Not really, and I think that even though Haiti is one of our major trading partners and exports some products to neighboring islands such as Trinidad &amp; Tobago and Barbados, among others, there should be more integration to facilitate trade in those markets. They have few products and as a result need to import many goods for their people. In the case of Haiti, is now done informally, with few unstable regulations for the flow of trade between the two.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the current regulatory environment and what changes would you like to see in the regulatory framework that could help further export growth? How far along is the implementation of a single window for foreign trade?</h4><p>Currently the incumbent government of President Danilo Medina has introduced some positive changes for export through the financing of associations of small producers of goods with export potential. We should check some regulations on trade and focus them on ensuring positive results in our trade balance. Regarding the establishment of a Single Window for Foreign Trade (VUCE) and according to what was discussed with the current Director of Dominican Customs, Mr. Fernando Fernandez, at our last lunch-conference of the General Director of Customs (DGA); the Single Window initiative is expected to be formally implemented by early 2015.</p><h4>What are your main priorities as the new president of ADOEXPO for the coming two years?</h4><p>During my presidency I have prioritized the training of SMEs, which account for 27% of GDP, and which represent 97% of the 600,000 Dominican companies and generate about 2.1 million jobs in our country. Second, the technical strengthening of ADOEXPO staff: in addition to our ISO 9001-2008 certification, which has greatly improved our processes, our team will receive  training from partner institutions. I will also focus my efforts on the facilitation of trade in the Dominican Republic in coordination with government initiatives.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Do you plan to launch any new special editions in the near future?<br></h4><p>The range of publications available in the Dominican Republic has been growing consistently over the course of the past decade. Coverage of specific niches of the market by special editions was required by the key sectors of the national economy. Through strategic planning, the Mercado Media Network has developed special editions that have become key reference guides of great value to the business community of our country.</p><h4>What is the average profile of your readers?</h4><p>Revista Mercado has two public objectives, the first of which is directed at executives and entrepreneurs, decision makers who need up-to-date information of the highest quality. Our secondary target demographic is young people at university or college studying in the field of business, and who see our editorial content as the best tool to help them advance in the world of business.</p><h4>How do you attract, train, and maintain the most talented human resources and how many people work for the firm?</h4><p>In the 21 years of constant expansion that our company has seen, we have never failed to maintain the international standards that befit business publications. Along with the excellence we expect of our committed editorial staff, we have also succeeded because of a marketing department that has in many ways surpassed local standards. Our company currently has 80 employees across our editorial, art, marketing, sales, distribution, circulation, and administrative departments. Our team's talent is continuously evolving, and is always guided by the enthusiasm, dedication, and leadership passed on by the heads of the various departments.</p><h4>Mercado Media Network has signed a number of prominent international publishing alliances with The Economist, Advertising Age, Harvard Business School, Suzy &amp; Jack Welch, John Tscholtz, Richard Branson, and CNN/Expansion. Do you plan further such expansion?</h4><p>Our most recent success in this area was the signing of our alliance with Bloomberg LTD, which reaffirms our leadership among business publications. This will not be our last such agreement however. We have also worked with the Time Inc. brand Sports Illustrated. Through these understandings we achieve an editorial mix that offers the best of domestic and international content. Beyond our national presence, we have subscribers in Miami, New York, and Puerto Rico, and are planning to expand our circulation in these areas over this year.</p><h4>How has social media affected the news industry, and how has Mercado Media Network responded to recent trends and technologies?</h4><p>The social media revolution is a reality, and the world of publishing has definitively changed in that regard. The interconnectivity of information and platforms is what allows publications to stay current and generate reader interest. Mercado Media Network is already prepared, offering added value to all of our editorial content through social media platforms, including the content from our international partners.</p><h4>What is Mercado Media Network's medium term development strategy, and what are its main focuses for the coming year?</h4><p>The development strategy is to reinforce our position as the market leader in publishing, while also launching new products that permit us to enter other segments of the market. For this year, the optimization of our services through a new entity called the Mercado Exchange will be a major focus. Toward those ends we have created a highly professional team focused on developing strategies and corporate services that complement our portfolio.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>WorldWide Group is a leader in international health insurance with a 70% market share. What factors led the company to establishing such a remarkable position in only 15 years?<br></h4><p>WorldWide Group specializes in major medical plans, which differ considerably from local insurance. Normally, in the Dominican Republic, the problem is that most of the market players are major US or European companies that normally sell offshore and local companies don't have a critical mass in order to compete with them. We have reached this position in 15 years, because we don't really have local competition and we focus on major medical plans. We cover up to $2 million per person. We have hundreds of clients in order to do business like this. I think that our work fights against a paradigm. People have a tendency to think that this kind of insurance is something that has to be bought from big names; however, they have started to realize that WorldWide has the same products and the same kind of service and coverage, which is the reason why we have reached this position. It is something that we did in Panama, in the Dominican Republic, and something that we can do in every country.</p><h4>What impact do the free trade agreements (FTAs) with the US and the EU have on the overall international health insurance sector in the Dominican Republic, and how does WorldWide compete with the international insurers?</h4><p>FTAs have an impact, which in our case is a positive one. I personally think that the barriers that countries put up in the economy are not good. I am convinced that businesses need to be free and compete with each other. In our case, we may not compete with local companies, but our competitors are large international companies. We sell the same products but at better prices, and people focus on prices. We can compete with mid-size international companies. I don't see any problem with that, as I see competition as a good thing.</p><h4>How have WorldWide's regional operations evolved over the few last years, and what have been the company's major milestones in 2014?</h4><p>We have evolved our business model. WorldWide employs two different methods when entering a market. One of them is direct, such as in the case of the Dominican Republic and Panama. We have an insurance license, and we sell directly and through brokers, which is something we are extremely successful in doing. Our other entry method is through reinsurance. In some markets, it is better for us to enter via an indirect way. An example of this would be Guatemala, which we will open through this way in January 2015. In Guatemala, we will work with a Guatemalan company that will sell our products and are reinsured by WorldWide. These are the two different entry methods that we use in order to cover the region.</p><h4>What is your expansion strategy, and what other countries, besides Guatemala, is WorldWide planning to enter?</h4><p>We plan to expand into Costa Rica, which is different from the other countries because it used to have an insurance monopoly for many years, and people there know little about competitive insurance. In this case, it is a promising market and we will enter it indirectly by reinsuring a Costa Rican company.</p><h4>What trends do you see in demand for the international health insurance in the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>The exciting trend is in the health sector, where people are looking for treatment outside the country. We have many rich and upper-middle class Dominicans who normally go to the US looking for better treatment; however, there are many lower middle-class people or people that due to their work can't have private insurance in the US. They are looking for health treatment outside the US in places such as India, Colombia, and Chile. There are many people in the US traveling to India in order to have surgeries. Another interesting change has been the development taking place in the countries we cover. In developing countries, most people think about insurance because they have something to protect and they realize it is important.</p><h4>What is the importance of the partnership with the German Investment and Development Company (DEG) for your company's development?</h4><p>WorldWide was founded in 1999, and at that time our partner was a local bank, BHD—a prestigious institution in the Dominican Republic. However, we needed a partner that can go with us throughout the entire region. DEG was created 50 years ago with an aim to invest in the private sector and in companies that promote the development of emerging markets. We are a company that has to invest part of our reserves in our countries, and we, of course, have competitors that sell offshore. DEG realized that this was an excellent investment in order to help develop the economy of the Dominican Republic and Panama.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you elaborate on the newly released Barceló Blanco Añejado? What are the trends in demand and what was the overall reaction of the market?<br></h4><p>The new product was launched in April 2014, catering to the huge market in the Dominican Republic, where standard white accounts for 50%. We basically needed something to compete in the white segment, but we were driven to do it with a product with unique characteristics that coincides with our innovative philosophy and the consumers' appreciation for value-added attributes. In our case an avant-garde packaging and a perfect blend of naturally aged rums became our milestone. Our purpose is to reach a leading position in this segment and, therefore, match our heritage obtained in the premium dark segment.</p><h4>What other milestones has BEICA reached in 2014?</h4><p>Becoming the fifth brand by volume in the global rum market, within a decade has been our biggest satisfaction. To sustain and improve this position is our most inspiring challenge. It is relevant to highlight that the most significant rum players are Indian and Philippine rum brands that are produced exclusively for domestic consumption. Respectively, the second and third biggest rum brands by volume are sold in these two countries. However, due to their value positioning and lack of international exposure we do not consider them as our competitors. Amongst other significant achievements, we attained 80% of the premium market in the Dominican Republic, achieved a leading position in Spain and Chile, and are the only Dominican rum brand to have a fully integrated production process starting with the harvest of our own sugar cane and ending with internationally awarded spirits. We have reached export levels of 1.5 million cases, which makes Ron Barceló the fourth largest export rum brand in the world.</p><h4>What are your main exports markets at present?</h4><p>We export 60% of our production, and of the products dedicated to exports 50% go to Spain, while Chile is the second market. In both these markets, Ron Barceló occupies a leading position. The US, Russia, Peru, Germany, and Honduras are also major export destinations in our portfolio. For the moment, we are not looking for new markets, specifically, but rather we are focused on improving our standing in markets in which we are already present. We are more motivated to attain a solid position in the US, Russia, Germany, Canada, and China. These are five key markets that we would like to add to the pillars of our international distribution.</p><h4>You mentioned that 40% of production is consumed in the Dominican Republic. Do you see the room for the further growth of local demand?</h4><p>The rum market in the Dominican Republic has been stable in terms of volume for the past few years. Even though the whiskey market has decreased against premium rum preference I do not really think that the Dominican Republic can consume much more rum than it does today. The Dominican Republic ranks fifth in the world in absolute numbers. Just after the US, India, the Philippines, and Cuba. In per capita terms, it occupies second place after Cuba.</p><h4>How is BEICA responding to positive trends in the Dominican Republic's tourism industry?</h4><p>We cater to tourists through our “Barceló Route," which enables visitors to be exposed to the complete process of Ron Barceló production. From the sugar cane plantation, through to how it is cut, how alcohol is obtained out of sugar cane juice, the processes of fermentation, distillation, and the art of natural aging. The tour starts in our distillery where an original sugar cane cart, adapted to accommodate our visitors, does a 20-minute ride, while our personnel explain the particularities of production. This ride is followed by a walk through our Ron Barceló Museum, which is a permanent exhibition of antique and modern tools, machinery, and techniques open to the public five days per week. Our museum is located within our elaboration plant facilities, so visitors are also introduced to the manufacturing process.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>As pointed out to me by President Danilo Medina, I was the first Vice President to visit the Dominican Republic since 1980. And I came here for a simple reason, on behalf of the President of the United States, because like President Medina, we believe very, very deeply in the importance of the relationship. I've said throughout the hemisphere that it is no longer the United States, and this administration is looking to the hemisphere, looking to the Dominican Republic and setting out what can we do for you.<br></p><p>We have an inordinate respect for your democracy, respect for the President, and respect for the people. And this is about equals—equal sovereign nations dealing with one another. We agree on almost everything. Where we disagree, we have an opportunity to tell each other where and when we disagree. We're not there yet so far. But the truth of the matter is this is the relationship that is based on mutual respect. And they're not just words. That is what our policy is about; it's mutual respect.</p><p>We can see how close we are. We have a million and a half Dominicans, many of whom are my friends and constituents, who live in the United States of America. And there are more than a million tourists that flock here. And there is baseball, which is the sinew that holds us together at the end of the day. We have so much in common that it's only natural that our interests and our values overlap with one another.</p><p>The President and I discussed all that he said, and I'm hopeful we're going to be able to discuss more. With regard to trade, we spoke about trade between our countries. And since the Central American and Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement, it has grown to $11.5 billion. And the President and I discussed what the next steps are in fully implementing CAFTA-DR, including efforts to provide predictable business environment under the rule of law, as well as to put in place protections for intellectual property, labor and the environment. They're essential elements of that agreement, and very, very important to the United States, and I'm sure to the Dominican Republic.</p><p>These aren't just the terms of the trade agreement, they're the ingredients for future growth. They are the basis for future growth. Where there is not labor protection, environmental protection and protection of intellectual property in this 21st century, there's not likely to be growth consistent with capability.</p><p>The other ingredient to growth is education. My wife is a professor and teaches full-time while being Second Lady. And she has an expression. She says, show me a country that out-educates you, and I will show you a country that out-competes you. And it's obvious that President Medina understands that; it is part of his DNA. I applaud him for his robust investment in education, including the constitutional mandate for a minimum share of the budget devoted to education. That is remarkable, and we wish the President every success in that regard. The Ambassador and I discussed ways in which we think we can. But it's up to President Medina to decide whether we can be a value-added.</p><p>On security, the President and I also spoke about our countries' shared efforts to protect our citizens from crime. We're working together to reduce illicit drug trafficking, increasing public safety and security, and to promote social justice, human rights, and the rule of law because security depends on much more than arrest and confiscation of contraband.</p><p>I spent the bulk of my professional life on the security side of this arrangement when I was Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, which has control over our criminal justice system. And I know we share a common sense of what need be done, and we're prepared to be of help.</p><p>And to give one small example, President Medina mentioned that together we've now put in place 911 emergency response for Santo Domingo. We see no reason why that cannot be—if you decide that's what you want—extend this to the whole country. There is no reason why it has to be limited to Santo Domingo. We're prepared to work with you to expand the 911 system.  And we hope your government shares our view that it should be expanded to your entire country. But that's for you to decide, not for us to decide.</p><p>The President and I also spoke about energy. The central issue for the Caribbean economies that are the most dependent in the hemisphere on energy imports that affects the lives of families and drains government budgets. It holds back economies, and people feel it. People feel it.</p><p>We also talked about regional issues. At least I will ask to talk more about it, about Venezuela and our mutual interest in bringing greater political inclusion, stability, and protection of basic human rights beyond the issue of energy production and availability.</p><p>We discussed immigration at some length. In my country, we're working to bring about change for 11 million undocumented women, men and children, and to bring them out of the shadows of American life and give them the dignity that they deserve.</p><p>We also are aware that it is also in our economic interest to do that. Every independent study shows when we do that, our economy actually grows. Our deficit shrinks. Our security system—our Social Security system gains additional leverage. And so as I told the President, I personally think that one of the secrets to America's ability to constantly renew itself is a consistent flow of immigration and integration into our population.</p><p>This is difficult, but we consider it a matter of economic self-interest, as well as a moral imperative. And the Dominican Republic faces its own challenge of improving the conditions of Haitian migrants and descendants who were born here in the Dominican Republic. I congratulated the President on the swift and decisive way and the overwhelming support he received in the legislature, in the Dominican Congress for the passage of a new naturalization law that is a serious piece of business.</p><p>And now it's about implementation. And we're confident that it will be implemented, and I spent time telling the President how pleased and quite frankly how surprised I was that he was able to act so swiftly in dealing with your Supreme Court decision. And it took a bold step that required bold leadership, which the President exercised. Implementation will be equally as important.</p><p>We had a wide-ranging and full discussion reflecting the close ties between our people, and the wide range of issues that connect us. Rest assured that we—the United States—value this relationship. We value it very highly, and make no mistake about it, we view the President and the country with great respect, as a sovereign nation that is equal in every discussion that takes place between us. I look forward to continuing our conversation.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>It was a privilege to be able to visit the Dominican Republic once again. As soon as I arrived I felt at home, as indeed I also want all Dominicans to feel at home when visiting Puerto Rico. We have had fruitful business meetings with the ambassador and President Medina. Bilateral ties have been highly significant and I want to strengthen that link between the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. For example, President Medina attended the inauguration of my term in January 2013, a year in which trade between both countries was valued at $700 million, a rather small amount taking into account that in the 1980s, the figure had stood at $2 billion. We want to raise trade figures to those levels again. Over the past 20 months, we have already increased trade activity to $500 million. Moreover, we have taken positive steps within the free trade business for the Dominican people in Puerto Rico. These measures have been focused on respecting Dominicans and other foreign communities in our country. For example, we pulled down social barriers when it comes to the migratory status of people and are the only country providing people with a driving license regardless of their migratory status. I passed this new law in August 2014 and more than 100 Dominicans have already obtained a license. We have also held talks with President Medina on the importance of increasing educational support and scholarships for higher education students from both countries and increasing exchange programs, especially for post-graduate students. Several of my colleagues in our office completed their higher education in the Dominican Republic. We also need to strengthen cultural exchange and increase cooperation in security matters. The latter is one of our top priorities in Puerto Rico, and I am proud to say that we have reduced the murder rate by 30%. This has been possible thanks to the Anticrime Strategic Plan, which provided police forces with more equipment and resources. We are ready to share this with the Dominican Republic in order to fight crime and drug cartels. We need to increase our efforts to fight drug cartels; they are the main source of crime in both countries. Thanks to the Anticrime Strategic Plan, we have also increased drug seizures at borders, airports, and ports by 300%. We have also opened dialog with the Dominican Republic to increase tourism cooperation, as we have an important flow of citizens from Puerto Rico visiting the Dominican Republic. I took the opportunity on this visit to stay for some days in this beautiful country. I want my children to feel the kinship that exists between our two countries, too.<br></p><p>As we become more effective in protecting the La Mona Canal, we will discourage people from using this channel to illegally enter the country. For us, the main issue is the safety of all people who that risk their lives by transiting the La Mona Canal. We feel a brotherhood with the Dominican Republic, and this is not a migratory status issue; we do not even like the term “illegal immigrant." We consider our government to have a human face, as our focus is on dealing with our social and economic problems for the benefit of our people. It is difficult to get a figure for the number of Dominicans to have benefited from our new social policies. For me, the most important consideration is that all Dominican expatriates in Puerto Rico feel safe and comfortable, that a woman about to give birth has the certainty of being able to go to a hospital, and that when someone needs emergency medical attention, they can comfortably do so. We have many more social policies to be implemented in the near future to assist expatriates living in Puerto Rico.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>The Dominican Republic is one of the fastest growing economies in the region, with a constant GDP growth average of 5.5% over the past 20 years. What is your medium term outlook for the economy and for 2015?<br></h4><p>The macroeconomic framework developed by the Ministry of Economy, Planning and Development serves as the economic policy guideline for the short and medium term, forecasts growth for the 2015-18 period at around the potential economic growth of the country, namely 5%. This potential growth considers the projected demographic trends of the country, as well as investment growth and productivity similar to that presented over the past decade.</p><h4>One of the sectors enjoying robust growth is tourism. In 2013 the country hosted 4.7 million visitors. Since 1980, the first year that the Central Bank reported tourism statistics, related revenues have risen from barely $172 million to $5 billion in 2013. Which sectors of the Dominican economy, besides tourism, hold the most potential for development?</h4><p>One sector of remarkable growth is mining, which grew by 20% in 1H2014 as compared to 2013. Growth of this sector is mostly a result of the commencement of operations of mining a company, Barrick Gold. Additionally, this administration has emphasized developing MSMEs, for which were allocated resources and efforts and to formalize and develop the companies of this nature. The government developed a comprehensive plan that covers the promotion of formalization, market access for MSMEs, financial development, business development, and the promotion of entrepreneurship. On the other hand, we have made progress in the agricultural sector because of a series of actions and policies implemented and promoted by the State, through the Special Fund for Agricultural Development (FEDA), with the aim of boosting agricultural production, encouraging and expanding exports of agricultural goods and increasing food security for the population. Within these measures we can highlight the support for land preparation services and technical assistance to producers, in addition to financial support through increased financing tools and channels, something that is reflected by the disbursements of the Agricultural Bank, which grew by 6.5% in September 2014.</p><h4>How far has the Dominican Republic gone with its National Development Strategy 2010-2030? Which of its goals have been achieved, and what are the main challenges the government is facing in its implementation?</h4><p>In general, two years after the promulgation of the Law on the National Development Strategy 2030, we have achieved at least one measure of policy in almost 45% of all proposed lines of action.</p><p>During the first year, we put great emphasis on preparing regulations to implement the strategy and interagency coordination. Following this, we proceeded to meet the proposed lines of action for which policy measures were adopted to achieve the following objectives. These featured participatory democracy and responsible citizenship, the rule of law and public safety, health and universal social security, macroeconomic drivers, competitiveness and innovation, a sector and territory-integrated production structure, and adequate adaptation to climatic change.</p><p>In general, one of the main challenges facing the National Development Strategy was thecontinuity of efforts without pause, to move forward in implementing policy to achieve the objectives outlined.</p><h4>What are the main advantages of the Dominican Republic as an FDI destination, what is the government's strategy to boost its flow, and what would be your message to potential investors seeking opportunities in the Caribbean?</h4><p>Much of the government's strategy to stimulate FDI has been supported in the process of comprehensively institutionalizing the country, and having the required institutions in operation to create a favorable business climate for FDI. Some of the initiatives and goals of the Administration are to realize the outlined fiscal consolidation process in pursuit of a substantial reduction in the primary deficit, the implementation of prudent and stable macroeconomic policies that prevent abrupt fluctuations, greater transparency of government operations, a state law reaffirming legal certainty, and pro-competition legislation.</p><h4>What are the main advantages of the Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) signed with the US and EU for the development of the Dominican economy?</h4><p>The advantage of having such FTAs is duty free access to the largest consumer markets with greater purchasing power. Furthermore, these facilities place us on equal terms with Central American countries, with which we would be at a disadvantage. Also, these treaties provide an environment of greater legal certainty, which is an incentive for investment. Looking ahead, treaties can be beneficial, to the extent that domestic producers improve their ability to compete by offering products meeting higher quality standards demanded by these countries, which would increase exports and employment. In the agricultural sector, for example, there is still room to reap the benefits of these treaties.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>According to the Central Bank, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the Dominican Republic has risen 245.5% over the past decade. Which factors underlie this and what sectors of the economy hold the greatest potential for further growth?<br></h4><p>The attractive business climate, the political and economic stability that characterizes the country, its strategic location, as well as a solid legal framework for foreign investment, have been the main factors in maintaining the Dominican Republic's position as one of the principal addresses for (FDI) in the Caribbean region, and among the top five recipients in Latin America for nine consecutive years. Over the past two years, FDI in the Dominican Republic has reached $5.13 billion, receiving 45% and 50.4% of the total flows of foreign capital registered in the region in 2012 and 2013, respectively. Investments have mainly been in the energy, commercial, real estate, and tourism sectors. FDI in 2014 reached $2 billion. Finally, strengthening the agribusiness sector as the essential basis of the Dominican economy has been one of the main goals of this administration, and the government has been implementing strategies to position our products in international markets, which is a key consideration for economic and social development nationwide.</p><h4>How can the Dominican Republic improve its balance of trade?</h4><p>The Dominican Republic has reduced the deficit in its balance of trade by 15.3% (from 2012 to 2013) and by a total of $1.534 billion. The strategy that has successfully achieved this reduction has included an increase in national production and attempts to reduce imports and increase exports. The latter has augmented considerably (12.3% in 2012; 11.9% in 2013; and 6.39% by October 2014), and we have worked this out through improved training programs for exporters and producers with export potential. We have also arranged for the financing of export projects and other initiatives, such as the creation of the Export Development Bank (BANDEX), so that Dominican producers can borrow at a competitive interest rate, presenting greater opportunities and prospects for consolidating the export sector. Similarly, the CEI-RD is currently working in cooperation with producers from different areas of the export sector in order to create a better-integrated national export culture, arranging a number of workshops for certification to meet the requirement of potential export markets. We are also improving our logistics and cold chain structure for the export of fruit and vegetables, to guarantee the quality of our products until they reach the final destination.</p><h4>Which export items hold the most potential for growth, and which new markets offer the best opportunities?</h4><p>The Dominican Republic is currently exporting 3,700 lines of merchandise to more than 60 countries around the world. In many of these markets, Dominican products have good potential for increased sales. The country's main commercial partners are currently the US and various EU countries, as well as Haiti and Canada. Current projects aim to introduce Dominican products into new markets in which they could be significantly competitive, including the markets of the Caribbean, Russia, and China. In addition, the country has a growing demand for fresh pineapple, citrus, passion fruit and melon, offering higher quality products than other countries, and providing faster logistics services, mainly due to our strategic location and robust infrastructure.</p><h4>What are the major advantages of investing in the Dominican Republic, and what is your message to would-be international investors?</h4><p>The Dominican Republic offers competitive operational costs for doing business, and an established network of support industries and services for the development of the different economic sectors as well as the improvement of the competitiveness level in the country. The Dominican Republic is ranked in first position in Latin America and the Caribbean with regard to the time required for the export of containers, and is second in imports. It offers some of the best transport infrastructure throughout the entire region, and boasts plentiful natural resources and an efficient workforce. Meanwhile, the President has provided comprehensive support and technical assistance required for the development of businesses. In short, this is the best time to invest in the Dominican Republic.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Santo Domingo is the country's primary economic motor, the city with the lowest unemployment rate, as well as the lowest level of poverty and disease. What is the contribution of its business community to the overall development of the Dominican Republic?<br></h4><p>The city of Santo Domingo is the most important economic center of the Dominican Republic. Currently in our country, there are around 950,000 companies, of which more than 600,000 where registered in the city of Santo Domingo; this means that more than 60% of all formal enterprises are currently operating in the city. The largest trading houses and financial centers in the country are located in the city of Santo Domingo. This is the reason why the business community of this city produces the most significant contributions to the development of the Dominican Republic.</p><h4>How significant is the Santo Domingo Chamber of Commerce and Production within the Dominican Republic's economy?</h4><p>The Santo Domingo Chamber of Commerce and Production (CCPSD) maintains a strong influence in strengthening and promoting economic activities within the city of Santo Domingo, but with an important impact on the entire national economy. Some examples of important contributions throughout the history to the economy of the Dominican Republic, carried out in order to boost and promote the business sector of the country, include; managing the construction of irrigation infrastructure, highways and roads with the Government; engaging in a continuous search for alternatives to promote commercial industry, and creating other agencies and institutions that support the strengthening of the various stakeholders and sectors of commercial interest. Some of these stakeholders include: The National Council of Private Businesses (CONEP), The Association of Industrialists of the Dominican Republic (AIRD), The Stock Market of the Dominican Republic (BVRD), The University Action Pro Education and Culture (APEC), and the Council of Conciliation and Arbitration, among many others.</p><h4>Currently, 97% of the Dominican Republic's enterprises are MSMEs, which generate more than 2 million jobs and account for 30% of GDP. How does the Santo Domingo Chamber of Commerce and Production support the MSME sector?</h4><p>According to the FondoMicro 2013 survey, there were 791,236 micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises in total. These companies employ a total of 2.2 million people, which represent 46.2 % of the economically active population of the country and 54.4 % of the total employment in the economy.The Santo Domingo Chamber of Commerce has undertaken several initiatives to support the business development of SMEs, such as managing and promoting the participation of entrepreneurs to international trade fairs and trade missions, providing courses and workshops, promoting discussions that enable the commercial sector to keep up with market reality, offering Business Consulting services, and fostering new business opportunities for the business sector of the country—particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).</p><h4>The Santo Domingo Chamber of Commerce and Production has recently signed an agreement with the Chamber of Qatar. What are the main highlights of this partnership and how will the Dominican companies benefit from it?</h4><p>We can identify two major points of relevance of this macro agreement signed between the parties, which are the promotion, development and diversification of trade and economic cooperation to the benefit of the entrepreneurs of both countries and the promotion and development of trade and economic cooperation.</p><h4>What other achievements has the Santo Domingo Chamber of Commerce and Production registered in 2014 and what are its main objectives for 2015?</h4><p>2014 has been a year of great transformations, in which we have achieved important goals, for the sake of encouraging the production and the development of business, not only in the city of Santo Domingo, but throughout the Dominican Republic. What's more, we connected even more Dominican entrepreneurs with business opportunities at a global level. For 2015, we are will continue to promote trade and production through various mechanisms. We aim at a greater participation in the national and international media, to disseminate the opportunities that can be used to enhance businesses around the country and in international markets to further drive the economic development of our country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Banco Popular celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2014, highlighting its leading position in the Dominican market. How has the bank grown since its foundation and what do you consider its landmark achievement?<br></h4><p>Banco Popular has always worked side by side with Dominicans, contributing and accompanying national growth and development over the past 50 years. Our institution rose from the Asociación para el Desarrollo, Inc. (APEDI), whose management was led by Alejandro E. Grullón E. and a group of accomplished professionals and businessmen from the city of Santiago. These men also created other national development institutions across the economic, regulatory, social, educational, and cultural spheres. Banco Popular opened its doors to the public on January 2nd 1964. It was inaugurated as the country's first commercial private bank and, thus, began an outstanding trajectory of contributions in favor of economic growth, democratization of financial services, diversification and modernization of products and banking services.</p><h4>The banking sector in the Dominican Republic is developing into intensively competitive market with many well-established local and international players. How does Banco Popular distinguish itself from the competitors and what market segments are you targeting?</h4><p>Throughout Banco Popular's 50 years it has cultivated deeps roots in the Dominican people. It has grown organically with the industry and has established a vast customer base throughout the years. The institution caters its services to all segments within the industry, from children with a savings account to multinational companies seeking new investments. Over the past decade the country has grown significantly, and with this growth a large number of international capital has found opportunities to invest within the country. Banco Popular recognized this change and has adapted to the current landscape creating different business segments within their structure. Among many areas in which we have introduced innovations is tourism where a division is focused solely on the industry catering to the needs of this demanding segment. Institutional Banking is an area catering solely to local and international regulated industries and government entities. Corporate Banking is a division focused on high net-worth clients of more than $5 million in revenue. Investment Banking is the newest division with three years in effect, and is responsible for several projects involving local and international investors. Some of their biggest international projects include M&amp;A, interest rate swap, and syndications and debt issuance of major multinationals within the tourism and oil industries. Our Subagente Popular network is a pioneering new channel for financial inclusion, allowing hundreds of thousands of Dominicans access banking services. Currently, we have a network of nearly 300 banking subagents throughout the country. Other financial inclusion initiatives have involved work with country's main telephone companies, where we have implemented the option of card-free ATM withdrawals, or without a pre-paid virtual account, by means of a mobile phone, which allows thousands of people to have a bank account and withdraw money without a card, and without having to be a customer of the formal financial system. Impulsa Popular is our end-to-end support initiative for the SMS sector, which includes a range of financial products and services, and training programs, discussion forums, and digital tools that promote them, regardless of whether or not they are a client of Banco Popular. The object of this initiative is to strengthen this sector, which is essential for the sustainable development of the Dominican economy. This initiative has been recognized by the Asociación de Industrias de la República Dominicana (AIRD), which is the Dominican Association of Industries. Meanwhile, ProExporta Popular is a groundbreaking proposal to comprehensively support Dominican exporters, especially SMEs that seek an international presence. In addition to the financial tools that assist exports, we offer support and advice throughout the whole internationalization process as well as training workshops and educational materials.</p><h4>What is Banco Popular's role in the development of the Dominican tourism industry?</h4><p>Ever since its creation half a century ago, Banco Popular has developed and supported the industry's growth. In fact, for many years our institution was the first and only bank which loaned funds to the Tourism industry. In 2007, we created a ground-breaking area specialized in catering to the specific needs of this thriving industry. In 10 years, Banco Popular has financed over Ps1.4 billion. In 2013, Banco Popular was responsible for over 61% of credits to this sector with a nominal amount of $13.5 million. In 2014, the Asociacion de Hoteles y Turismo de la Republica Dominicana (ASONAHORES), which is the Hotel and Tourism Association in the Dominican Republic, recognized our institution as the tourism bank.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[surveying-the-land]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>GoldQuest commenced exploration in the Dominican Republic in May 2001. Why has a Canadian company decided to locate its operations here?<br></h4><p>Historically, the strong potential for gold on the island has been well known. For example, Pueblo Viejo, the largest gold mine in Latin America, was known about during colonial times. Hence, there is a history of sizable gold production here. This means that the Dominican Republic is attractive for anyone keen on gold exploration work, including ourselves. Initially we came here based on Pueblo Viejo, the well-known deposit. But on top of that there were other smaller deposits, and GoldQuest decided it was a good time and place to do some exploration. We came and initiated regional exploration in a totally new area, which is the southern part of the Cordillera Central. Most of the deposits I am talking about are in the northern part of the Cordillera Central. We recognized that the rock in the southern part of the Cordillera Central was similar to that in the northern section, but no one was looking there at the time. Therefore, we were the group to initiate exploration. A discovery is a rarity in geology and mining, and usually follows after several years of exploration. Therefore, we were initially undertaking highly regionalized work. We did not invest or explore significantly until 2010 when we decided to probe deeper into those areas where we found anomalies. In 2012 we made a major discovery, whereby we became the most successful junior company in the world that year. We believe there is huge potential in the Dominican Republic and Haiti for mineral exploration and development. In my opinion, the minerals that are the most important so far are copper and gold, although there is also silver and zinc present. I would say those four metals could hold the greatest potential for the island in the future. But this will require considerable exploration by us and the many other companies that will likely enter the market in the future.</p><h4>Can you explain the current technology used at your Romero and Tireo projects? What future innovations do you foresee?</h4><p>We are using what we consider to be state of the art technology. When we made the discovery in 2012 we had minimal funds available, but we were fortunate. At that time we became the company of choice for investors; they invested substantially in our company and we decided to utilize the most effective technology. We have a substantial area of land, at 20,000 hectares, and until 2012 we had only explored 10% of it. This meant that we knew nothing about the balance of the property. In order to undertake effective exploration work we had to resort to techniques that help investigate large areas rapidly, which are extremely expensive, and we opted for an airborne survey. This meant using a helicopter with the relevant instrument to fly over the property, rather than doing the task on foot. The survey gives you an indication of whether or not there is potential mineralization. We chose a new Canadian system, which is able to look at the earth's profile to considerable depth, whilst showing fine detail. In addition to the airborne survey we do ground surveying; this means traditional mapping, and we still have to perform the sampling and drilling. This is basically what we are using; all the technology available to focus on mineral deposits.</p><h4>How does GoldQuest incorporate social responsibility into its mining projects in the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>Mining has to be integrated into society and has to be conducted with a high level of responsibility for the people living in the area. We are carrying out all activities required to protect the environment. For example, we have been carrying out water sampling work for almost a year and a half because we want to build enough information so that when we apply for the environmental permit we have sufficient proof, historically, that we have been taking care in our exploration work and measuring every aspect. At the same time we want to prove that if we operate the mine we will never contaminate it. So in other words, the water that we are measuring is extremely clean. The other factor is that the communities where we work are normally poor. Health and education are the basic requirements at the moment. For this reason, we built a school in the community and we assist the government in paying for the teaching staff. We also assist with adult education in efforts against illiteracy. Meanwhile, we also provide two scholarships to locals to go to Instituto Tecnológico de Santo Domingo (INTEC), which is the only university in the country to offer geology as a discipline. These students will hopefully return to their community to work upon graduation. Furthermore, there was no health unit in the area we operate in, so we created one for the benefit of both the community, and our own staff. We offer comprehensive healthcare and security for workers and their families.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does Tamboril Free Zone Park complement other free zones in the Dominican Republic, and what is its contribution to the socioeconomic development of Santiago?<br></h4><p>We have 5,800 employees at the moment, with a goal of getting to 6,000 by the end of 2014. This number of people contributes approximately Ps100 million a month in revenues, salaries, and expenses to the Santiago province. Our workers are, on average, 22 years old. Around 55% are women, and we have been growing at a rate of 50% every year for the past four years, mainly as a result of the shoe industry. We have been expanding our capacity in construction, and currently have 23 buildings, and more than 93,000 sqm in area terms. At the moment, we are a combination of a real estate firm providing the buildings and all the necessary infrastructure, and a logistics and service company through our support for clients who want to set up their own factories by themselves. We have another model that allows us to also become part of the business, and help them to create and develop the factory. We can do this efficiently because of our extensive experience in the sector, and our 20 years of experience in the shoe industry. I come from the manufacturing industry and have been making shoes in the free zone for the past 25 years. We are using a combination of attracting customers with an offer of state-of-the-art facilities to set up their own factories, and strategic partnerships to make and develop shoe factories in a joint venture model.</p><h4>What is the importance of hosting companies such as Taiwanese Hong Fu, the producer of Vans?</h4><p>Having a corporation like Hong Fu as a contractor for Vans or the VF Corporation has caused a dramatic change in our business, for a variety of reasons. First of all, it is the first time there has been a shoe investment project in the Dominican Republic since the country signed the Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR). We participated in the CAFTA-DR negotiations, representing the private sector, specifically the shoe sector. I had the opportunity to be part of the committee representing the country, thanks to the Minister of Industry at the time, Sonia Guzmán. She did a tremendous job in negotiating the agreement, by including the private sector as an important player in the negotiation. By doing this, we acquired a regulation, which is called “a flexible rule of origin," which means that we can make shoes in the Dominican Republic from raw materials coming from any part of the world. We only need what is called “simple transformation," which means that if we buy materials from any part of the world, including the Far East, just by transforming them into a finished product, the merchandise can claim Dominican origin. By doing that we received interest from companies from the Far East, and also from the US. We can offer a competitive labor rate, a skilled workforce, proximity to the US market and, of course, duty free status. The Hong Fu Group is the largest vulcanized shoe producer in the world, with more than 14 factories in three countries and more than 60,000 employees. This is bringing the attention of other companies to the Dominican Republic.</p><p>Becoming a strategic partner with a company like this has been important for us. We are a partner here helping them to set up the facility, training the personnel, controlling the costs, and working with the technical staff. We are involved in the logistics of bringing materials in and shipping products to the US. We also help them gain duty-free status because you have to apply and receive certification stating that the product is made in the Dominican Republic, in compliance with the CAFTA-DR requirements.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Founded in 1967, Roig Agro-Cacao, S.A. soon became one of the country's leading exporters of cocoa beans and one of the largest organic cocoa exporters in the world. What factors led the company to claiming its position?<br></h4><p>From the outset, our key strength has been the ability to establish relations with farmers, the suppliers, that stretch back for generations. I started my professional life in the main cocoa growing area of San Francisco de Macoris. It took me eight years to establish these relationships and a climate of mutual trust.</p><p>In 1998 we suffered hurricane George, prior to which most of the beans exported from the Dominican Republic were of the Sanchez variety; a non-fermented bean. Essentially starting from scratch after the hurricane, we started experimenting with fermentation. Considering we are a low volume country compared to the African producers, and in the interests of competitiveness against far larger players, we set about fermenting to attract high quality companies, mainly in Europe and Japan, where we could enjoy better differentials, and better margins, which translates into better prices for the farmer—in short, positively impacting the entire chain. That was also where we entered the, at the time embryonic, organic market.</p><h4>What key steps should be taken to boost the development of the Dominican Republic's cocoa industry?</h4><p>From my point of view today there are two key aspects to consider. We need to improve our genetic material, which we are already at work on. We embarked on this both at a private and government level and the results have been highly encouraging. The minister has extended full support.</p><p>Another key consideration is the need to improve sanitary controls at airports to safeguard against diseases. We are working to develop an emergency team to undertake this responsibility, and we are in the process of developing protocols on how to handle emergencies.</p><h4>What are Roig's medium-term development strategies and objectives for 2015?</h4><p>Currently, we are squarely focused on quality. As for the future, there are different steps to be taken, one being to experiment further with flavor. In the fermenting process the yeast that affects the flavor of cacao is in the pod. And if you are able to identify the specific yeast that promotes a specific flavor, be it the floral aroma, the nutty or the plum flavor, and you are able to cultivate that yeast, you reproduce it and pour it over the cacao during the fermenting process, which can have interesting results. That is one plan we are working on.</p><p>Plan II we started two years ago, when we built a distillery operation at the factory. What we are doing is collecting the pulp and juices from farms and other operations. When you ferment the beans, all the material drains out through specific piping. It is pasteurized, distilled, and exported to the US. We and our local partners are partnered with a US company called Solbeso that is promoting and distributing the product. They have developed the brand which is currently being sold in New York, Miami and, soon, in London.</p><p>The idea is to transform waste into revenue. It will also lead to additional income for the farmer, and seems to have some potential, being a beverage made from 100% alcohol derived from organic cocoa beans. In nature it resembles something, I would say, between tequila and vodka, and is flexible enough to use in a wider range of cocktails such as margaritas.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[coffee-to-go]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the level of competitiveness in the Dominican coffee industry at the moment?<br></h4><p>The competitiveness of the coffee industry in the Dominican Republic is great, especially when we refer to foreign markets. This is because coffee of Dominican origin is appreciated by the large consumers in the coffee market for its attributes; it is unmatched for its excellent quality. This level of competitiveness will improve substantially over the coming years as we see the results of the Plantation Renewal Program with vegetative materials, and due to the high genetic quality that the government has been sponsoring through the Dominican Coffee Council.</p><h4>Most of the Dominican Republic's producers are smallholders. Moreover, the more than 45,000 Dominican families producing coffee depend on it for their living. What support can the small-scale farmers count on in the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>Producers will continue to have the support that allows them to organize in cooperatives, associations, and clusters that promote partnerships and thereby allow them to become micro entrepreneurs in the sector. There are coffee systems and technical assistance to qualify and orientate them in the management of their plantations to achieve higher yields. They are offered support such as the provision of bags and seeds, fertilizers and tools, and advice on the establishment and production of coffee plants in nurseries. These plantations have coffee rust disease resistance, high production capacity, and good quality. Road improvement programs in production areas and support in post harvest processes have benefited production.</p><h4>Coffee rust has recently impacted on the entire coffee population in the Dominican Republic causing huge financial losses. What is the importance of the agreement that CODOCAFE signed with the National Institute of Hydraulic Resources (INDRHI) for controlling the disease in the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>With this agreement, CODOCAFE implemented an Early Warning Program in coordination with the Bureau of Meteorology and with the support of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). We have 223 weather stations at our disposal across all rural areas. Through these we get information about weather that favors the growth and progression of the disease, allowing us to monitor the incident levels, and make timely recommendations for treatments to reduce and eliminate the fungus that affects plantations simultaneously. And we are able to do this in real time through mobile phones that record the weather data and incidences.</p><h4>What other challenges is the coffee industry in the Dominican Republic facing?</h4><p>The biggest challenge we have is to raise the level of productivity for the coffee plantations that right now are around 101 acres in size. We need to raise their technical performance levels, which means renewing plantations with coffee varieties of high production capacity that are resistant to diseases, and are adaptable to climate change. We also need to improve the planting density, have timely funding for the work, and maintain continued technical assistance and support.</p><h4>Do you see the potential for the DR to expand in the coffee market?</h4><p>The Dominican Republic, although it has lost a significant share in the international market as a result of the decrease in production, retains enormous potential due to the exceptional quality of Dominican coffee. The government's Plantation Renewal Program implemented through CODOCAFE contributes greatly to the expansion of production, and with that the country will be able to recover much of its lost ground. The high quality that Dominican coffee displays is more than enough to penetrate any discerning and demanding market today. Ultimately, Dominican coffee has significant potential because of its undisputed quality, coupled with the set of actions that are being implemented to further increase its quality to satisfy both domestic consumption and the international market.</p><h4>What does the Dominican Republic offer in terms of quality and variety of coffee beans?</h4><p>The quality of Dominican coffee has been steadily improving. We offer an interesting variety of coffees depending on the region, including Cibao Altura, Barahona, and Ocoa.</p><h4>What are some of the actions that need to be implemented to increase exports?</h4><p>Exports will increase to the extent production also increases in the country. To date we have renewed about 2,260 hectares of plantations. Domestic consumption has increased as reflected in reduced exports that are being processed by the local industry instead. The DR exports organic, roasted, and ground coffee to meet commitments in the existing markets held by several Dominican coffee brands and types. These have been recognized for their quality and flavor. We have excellent soil and climate for the production of high-quality coffee. With the policy of attracting investment to the country, this can be exploited to install large plantations and facilities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[prescription-for-growth]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Medical tourism is a highly profitable global phenomenon with tremendous potential for further growth. As an expert in the field could you talk us through this new global trend?<br></h4><p>Medical tourism is the segment seeing the most growth within the health industry, of 25% a year. It represents at least 2.5% of travelers per plane, and the figures differ depending on the source. The Medical Tourism Association (MTA), which is based in the US, claims that about $60 billion is generated by medical tourism. That includes not only medical care, per se, but also odontology and wellness at facilities such as spas. Medical tourism is growing rapidly because the world population is aging and becoming more affluent at rates that surpass the availability of quality health care resources. Additionally, the long waiting lists in countries like the US and Canada, and the high cost of medical treatments are problematic—the leading cause of bankruptcy for individuals in the US is health problems, making up 50% of cases.</p><h4>The Government has been focused on developing the tourism industry, but will this make a difference in the medical tourism segment?</h4><p>Medical Tourism is a segment that helps to grow and diversify the offer. The key factors are quality, safety, certifications, JCI and ISQUA accreditation, and health centers of excellence. Not everybody can be a candidate to offer medical tourism services, as international criteria must be met. First, you have to comply with local criteria, such that the center needs to be licensed by the Ministry of Public Health and the professionals should be part of the medical college and their medical specialty society. In addition, the hospital should be certified and have international departments that manage the entire patient experience, and optimally accredited by the joint commission international (JCI). In the Dominican Republic, there are three centers working towards the accreditation process (Hospital General de la Plaza de la Salud, HOMS, and CEDIMAT).</p><h4>Along with the above, what opportunities do you see in the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>Medical tourism brings opportunities for raising the bar on quality, and the need for certifications and accreditations will positively impact locals and health indicators. This will also create new jobs and attract foreign investment to the country. On a larger scale, legal security is required such that if a foreign company is going to invest in the country, their investment is secure in the long term. That is an important area for us to work on. Another area of importance at present is public and private alliances. The Center for Exportation in the Dominican Republic (CEI-RD) has an initiative to create an investment exequatur with the ministry of health and Dominican Medical College, namely a license that international health professionals could obtain to practice medicine in the Dominican Republic. This initiative would consist of investors coming to the Dominican Republic to establish health centers of excellence. They might well already have a special permit, but first, it has to meet established criteria, preferably regarding technology that we lack in the country, which will promote knowledge transfer, and sustained medical education, creating employment and opportunities for the local community. Thirdly, it should not create unequal competition for local physicians. Essentially, the establishing of international centers of excellence is geared at helping to differentiate us in the medical tourism industry and also raise the bar on quality and top-notch procedures.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main features and facilities of Punta Espada Golf Club?<br></h4><p>We have 18 holes and a clubhouse. It is an operation that is oriented at servicing the golfer and the main feature is the golf course. We have a wonderful design, and a wonderful location. It is difficult to find a more beautiful destination. We have eight holes on the oceanfront, where you can almost feel the waves. We also have the advantage of having a small bluff running through the property so that there are some holes on top of that bluff that have wonderful ocean views as well. Its location, design, and maintenance keep the course at the best possible level. It is really a factor that separates us from the rest. It is expensive, but we want to have the course as close to what the pros would play on as possible. We have already hosted three Champion's Tour events, so we know what their demands are and we are very close to that on a day-to-day basis.</p><h4>What is the average profile of Punta Espada's guests?</h4><p>The main client is a North American, usually from the US. Quite a few Canadians come as well, but the main clients are from the US East Coast, where they have the most direct flights to and from the Dominican Republic. That is where we see the biggest impact. The average age is usually between 35 and 60. We are also starting to see some Latin American activity and we always see some European activity too.</p><h4>How popular is golf among Dominicans?</h4><p>Due to our environment and business model our operation caters to a high-end residential and tourist resort customer. We are less geared toward servicing the local Dominican golfer. We are seeing an increased interest and more players coming up the ranks.</p><p>FEDOGOLF is doing a good job of developing golf locally, but that is really not our target client. We depend on the international golfer, but we still do some local tournaments in the summer. We try to take advantage of the low season to host some local tournaments that attract the local golfers to come out and play.</p><h4>How does Punta Espada contribute to the local economy?</h4><p>We will do approximately 15,000 rounds this year. In the high season, a client of ours that is not a member, or a guest of a member, will pay $375 to play on this course, plus they will tip the caddies, buy beverages and lunch, and so on. The client is spending around $450 on a day of golf, money that stays here in the local economy.</p><p>I also think there is huge potential for growth. The Dominican Republic currently attracts approximately 100,000 golfers and this number is not close to the potential for what we have on offer already on the island. Promotion to position the Dominican Republic as a golf destination is still required in order to potentially triple that number in a five-year span, if the marketing dollars are put behind that campaign. That would impact the economy because 100,000, (and Punta Cana will have 1.6 million tourists in 2015), does not represent a big piece of the pie. But, if you take what they spend locally, then this represents a much bigger piece than just in terms of volume.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the Dominican Republic's infrastructure?</h4><p>It is constantly improving. The roads are fantastic. Last year we saw part of the impact of the new road that connected the Punta Cana area to La Romana and Casa de Campo, and now that word is spreading and we are seeing more and more golf groups coming over to play at Punta Espada. Some of our clients also attend Casa de Campo so it works both ways. Not only is the Punta Cana airport growing, but it is now ready for 5 million passengers. There are three international airports within an hour and a half car drive.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the composition of AGRODOSA's portfolio and what is the average client profile?<br></h4><p>AGRODOSA is a joint enterprise involving the Dominican government and the private sector, acting as a private company. The aim of the company is to provide market security by insuring the agricultural and agribusiness sectors. Our company has revalorized itself since President Medina assumed office. Under his administration, a new Law on Agricultural Insurances was passed, setting a legal framework that allowed the agricultural insurance sector to better manage future risk. Moreover, the government has been subsiding the purchase of certain insurance premiums for small producers, as high risks and costs prevail in that sector. This support goes well beyond 25% (in some cases even 50%) of the insurance costs for small producers, who cannot afford it. This support has also enabled producers to have a small reserve set aside in the event of a natural disaster. I also believe it has helped to reduce poverty levels in the rural areas of the country. AGRODOSA has worked closely with the state, in facilitating this payment/subsidy. At the same time, we have particular agreements with all state institutions present in the agricultural industry such as the Banco Agricola, the Institute of Tobacco, and FEDA. We have set up joint efforts to launch new insurance products; health insurance, life insurance, and other related coverage. We are also studying the possibility of insuring agricultural producers against terminal illnesses. AGRODOSA has already established international partnerships in this field and we will soon launch a new product linked to terminal illnesses. We want to further democratize these insurance tools, thus contributing to the reduction of poverty levels in the country.</p><h4>What is the importance of the Agricultural Policy Program, supported by the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation in Agriculture, with an investment of more than Ps480 million donated by the European Union towards enhancing regional capacities for small-scale farmers?</h4><p>The Dominican Republic is a small country in which agricultural reform began in 1982. That marked a turning point in the development of the sector, yet taking into account global technological, chemical, and agricultural developments, the agriculture sector in our country has not kept pace. There are two key requirements for transforming the Dominican agricultural sector; financing and organization, which is contingent on the level of cooperation. This is vital for our country since we have neither the economic resources, nor the level of expertise of many of our competitors in the international market. These developments will be necessary before we can compete on the international stage. This kind of economic support definitely helps to professionalize the activity of many small and medium-sized producers, transforming their activity and boosting market cooperation. These elements will help us to raise both production volumes and quality.</p><h4>In 2013 the Dominican agricultural sector recorded growth of 16.5% compared to 2012. What factors led to this and what are your expectations for 2014?</h4><p>Up until 2012, only the elite among the Dominican agricultural sector had access to financial tools, and small producers were completely neglected. The newly-appointed ministers and public officers implemented changes in this regard; they allocated Ps6 billion in 2013 to small producers. These financial tools have transformed the agricultural sector, in part by boosting cooperation between producers. For example, over 30,000 farmers and small producers became part of the production chain thanks to this support. It goes without saying that we also benefited from that. There have been other changes as well; in 2002, there were 400,000 sqm of greenhouses, while the goal is to reach 10 million sqm in the near future. The government has ramped up spending in education, as well.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>St. Patrick School has existed in Santo Domingo since 2005. How did the idea of its establishment arise and how has the School evolved over the years?<br></h4><p>St. Patrick School of Santo Domingo, was founded on March 17, 2005. The idea came from the need to provide an integral, modern education for students from preschool all the way to high school. In 2007, motivated by the need to continue promoting the strong principles that underpin our educational beliefs, we adopted the Catholic identity and included specific subjects in our curriculum, as well as special activities to promote the highest human values that frame our identity as a school: integrity, loyalty, and commitment. Recently we launched our new mission and vision, and three new values necessary for the 21st Century: leadership, innovation, and respect. St. Patrick School is currently in its 10th year.</p><h4>What standards does St. Patrick School follow to ensure that its students will be well prepared to enter colleges and thrive in a constantly changing world?</h4><p>As a preparatory school, St. Patrick School is committed to offering a program based on the Common Core Standards that has consistently high standards that provide students with a set of clear expectations to ensure that they all have the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in the 21st century, be it at college, in a career and in wider life upon graduation from high school, regardless of where they live. The standards promote equality by ensuring all students are well prepared to play leading roles and collaborate with their peers in the Dominican Republic and abroad.</p><h4>What role do technology and innovation play at St. Patrick School?</h4><p>Our school provides teachers and students with a secure WiFi network where they can safely navigate and use their tablets to get access to different digital tools like Schoology, Dropbox, Kahn Academy, and other sites. The publishing houses with which the school has signed contracts provide a platform for teachers and students to interact even when they are not in school. St. Patrick School strongly believes in innovation, as demonstrated in our updated curriculum which paves the way for facilitators to plan based on the Common Core Standards. Smartboards, projectors, and computers have been installed in most classrooms to provide time and space for innovative and interactive teaching.</p><h4>What is St. Patrick School's midterm development strategy?</h4><p>We recently opened our new preschool, in order to satisfy the demands of the community. This school year SPS has embarked on achieving on a new objective: the transformation of our mission and vision, to ensure our best intentions are actively pursued and realized. We need a true mission and vision, focused on leadership culture, which is applicable to all aspects of the school. It has been an adventure and taken much work to capture the essence of what we, and the country, truly need. St. Patrick School enables its students to develop skills such as leadership, creativity, emotional intelligence, negotiation, effective communication, teamwork, analytical thinking, self-motivation, decision-making, positive attitude, proactivity, and entrepreneurship, among others.</p><p>Our true mission is to contribute, from our classrooms, to the students' development and acquisition of knowledge and capabilities. We want to improve their surroundings, and help them to become enterprising leaders. Though this may not be a fashionable term, we believe it is a skill which correctly channeled can be fruitful.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Caribe Trans is a member of several associations, including FIATA, IATA, and ADACAM. How does the company benefit from this, especially in terms of exchanging expertise and know-how with other associates?<br></h4><p>We are members of FIATA and IATA, and these two organizations were created long ago in order to regulate business activity in the air cargo transportation (IATA) and freight forwarding (FIATA) segments. These associations offer regular training and education programs for their members, and also lobby governments to recognize the association's concerns, initiatives, and proposals. Throughout the years, both have become leading institutions in their areas. With the Dominican Association of Air and Maritime Cargo Agents (ADACAM), we tried to take the best from both of these organizations and integrate it internationally as an association that will look after all of our associates  involved in the supply chain management industry. The Dominican Republic's logistics industry lacked such a common vision, and as the country raised its profile as a third party logistics provider clients required a complete and fully integrated logistics service. One of the goals of the association is to make of the logistics service a one-stop shop where clients can find everything, and at the same time tailoring all the services to the need of the clients. Our company provides third party logistics services, but we also handle air cargo in collaboration with American Airlines, Copa Airlines, Air France, Air Canada, and Amerijet. We handle air cargo with these companies mainly in Santo Domingo, Santiago, Puerto Plata, and Punta Cana. We also have a project forwarding division. More recently, we have focused on green energies, especially wind energy, and we had a major contract with one of the largest suppliers. We also have customs brokerage services as an Authorized Economic Operator (OEA), and we offer a team of experienced technicians to perform all the processes related to imports, exports, and logistics in general. We also have our own warehouses operating in the major airports in the country. In addition, we are part of a larger logistics project for the development of the new Haina logistics center. Lately, we have noticed that customers are starting to understand they could have a lean management model implemented in their companies by reaching out to third-party logistics providers, who already have the warehouse and personnel capabilities. In this sense, we are able to go to our customers and offer them an integrated third-party logistics solution thanks to our partnerships and capabilities. We have the technology and know-how, which makes us one of the most reliable and strongest players in the industry.</p><h4>What role do technology and innovation play in Caribe Trans' operations?</h4><p>Our aim is to become an IT company that provides third party logistics services, not the other way around. This is something I try to highlight to all our employees. In this sense, we invest heavily in IT. This year we are facing a major challenge with the revamp of our IT system in the company, this step will make us stronger for the benefit of our customers and principals. In general, we like to work with consultants, as they teach you how to better implement processes and systems for the benefit of the company and customers alike. In this sense, we are always keen to achieve international industry standards such as the ISO 9001:2008, BASC, ISSAGO, and the OEA.</p><h4>What is the significance of the $5 billion investment in the expansion of the Panama Canal for Caribe Trans, and for the overall logistics sector in the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>The Panama Canal is a crucial gateway to our part of the world, and its expansion will mean an influx of greater cargo volumes into the region. The Dominican Republic has much to offer, with the Caucedo Port serving as a hub targeting South America, Europe, and Haina  Port which handles a great volume of the US cargo plus having the great advantage of being inside the city and closer to the logistics centers that currently operate. Our connectivity is one of the most competitive in the region. We have a 10-day transit time from  Europe, and less than three days from Panama and the US,  which is extremely competitive. The government is aware of the country's potential in this area, and has publicly declared support for its development. We need to work swiftly, otherwise other countries will take that position before us. We have the infrastructure in place, with a strong network of ocean ports and airports between Punta Cana, Santiago, and Santo Domingo, and we also have the capabilities and the potential.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What factors helped Codelpa to establish a leading position in the Dominican Republic's construction sector in just two decades?<br></h4><p>Following the expansion of the tourism sector, we decided to focus on construction, and today we are the foremost builder of hotel facilities. Codelpa currently has over 10,000 beds in its portfolio of built and renovated hotels. We have also benefited from the conditions that foreign investors enjoy here, which has brought many foreign companies to the Dominican Republic to build hotels. As business expanded, we expanded operations to other countries; for example, in 2005 we entered the Jamaican market to open a couple of new hotels. We believe that Jamaica has great potential within the tourism industry. Codelpa has also developed industrial projects in Haiti, and will explore new markets in the near future.</p><h4>Could you tell us more about your current projects, such as Terminal A at Punta Cana Airport?</h4><p>We have two projects in Punta Cana, which we built within six months. They are breath-taking projects that are in line with the style we have established over the years. Our projects are always completed on time, and one of our greatest advantages is our team of young and talented professionals. We have invested considerable time and resources in our people and processes; we are fully certified with ISO 9001 and have played an active role in industrializing the national construction sector. Codelpa has also invested in many facilities and processes related to the construction sector. For example, we are self-sufficient in cement blocks and concrete.</p><h4>Who are Codelpa's main clients?</h4><p>Barcelo Hotels is one of our major clients today. We have also built for Grupo Martinón, Royalton, NH Hotels, and Bahia Principe, among many others. This confirms our flexibility and ability to meet international standards. Regarding our business activity, in 2014 we focused on strengthening our HR department in order to improve the training of our professionals. We have also built bridges with the higher-education sector to provide our staff with other development opportunities. In addition, closer ties with universities will allow us to identify new professional talent.</p><h4>In October 2013, Codelpa was recognized as the best construction company in the tourism sector for the 2005-2012 period. What is the contribution of such an award to customer confidence and attracting new clients?</h4><p>These are two key important elements of our business. This award was bestowed by the Chamber of Construction, based on our impact on the tourism industry; making us the most important local company in this regard. The Association of Hotels also reinforced the prestige, by highlighting how we conduct our operations from a business perspective. Over the years, we have partnered with European, Canadian, and US firms, meaning that we know how to adapt our work to their expectations; we are a hugely flexible company.</p><h4>Since 1980, revenues generated by the tourism sector have increased, from barely $172 million to $5 billion in 2013. How does Codelpa plan to respond to that upward trend and what industry segments do you see the most opportunities in?</h4><p>The economy must be prepped for the growth of tourism. However, we also need to further diversify our business activity. There is also great potential in some segments of the tourism industry as this has evolved over the past few years. We now target a more high-end audience, rather than solely the all-inclusive market. For example, there is great potential in the luxury and ecotourism segments. Health tourism could also bring some interesting developments and in my opinion, this may take place sooner than people expect Finally, we still need to explore the second residence segment within the tourism sector, and take full advantage of our proximity to the US and Canada. We have taken some steps in this regard, but we have yet to fully exploit it.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Medical tourism is a highly profitable global phenomenon with a tremendous potential for further growth. How would you assess its development in the Dominican Republic?<br></h4><p>The Dominican Republic has a huge potential in the medical tourism sector and I see more and more people coming here for treatment. In November, I attended the Global Medical Tourism Conference organized by the authorities of all the Caribbean countries to discuss the potential of developing the region as a health tourism destination. At that conference I realized that our country has all it takes in terms of infrastructure and potential, and that we simply need to promote this to the world. The key factor now is quality and the players in the national project. We are set to promote the country as a whole, rather than specific hospitals. Therefore, we need to monitor the quality levels of participants. Currently we are formulating the certification processes for hospitals and clinics. Some of the criteria we prioritize include having an international department, where the staff speaks English, and so on.</p><h4>What role do Public-Private-Partnerships (PPPs) play in the development of the sector?</h4><p>Cooperation between the public and the private sectors is key for the development of the health tourism sector. The tourism board has considerable resources in terms of branch network and a robust promotion chain. And once we integrate medical tourism as part of our promotional goals, the field will become much clearer to navigate. The private sector, meanwhile, has the facilities, knowledge, technology and qualified staff. I think the success of the medical tourism sector depends upon cooperation between the public and private sector. This will also show foreign investors that we are willing to help each other to achieve common goals.</p><h4>What strategies and initiatives are being implemented to promote the Dominican Republic as a medical destination?</h4><p>We do not implement specific actions, because we are in the process of giving a framework to the participants of this nationwide project and setting up quality levels. However, we have plans to promote the country and medical tourism across four areas: dentistry, plastic surgery, orthopedics, and bariatric surgery. At the same time, we want to position the Dominican Republic as the second home for medical visitors. We want, essentially, to exploit the friendliness of Dominicans and the natural wonders of our country as a tourism destination. We initially target Dominicans residing in the US, as we know they want to come here for treatment. In New York alone there are over one million Dominicans. We believe the slogan “you feel at home" will work perfectly with this target audience.</p><h4>What are the main guidelines of your three-year plan?</h4><p>One of the goals is to sign a partnership with the Medical Tourism Association. We plan to carry out a feasibility study to determine our main expenses over the next six months; we know we have the potential, and plan to better target our audiences. As I said, our first target audience is Dominican expatriates. This would represent phase one of the plan. In phase two, we want to invest in training, and we foresee the creation of a dedicated cluster. This is foreseen materializing within around a year's time, and should raise the level of quality and technology of our industry. We also have a program to develop health and clinical programs, in which we will work toward education and promotion of the country. Finally, phase three will see the creation of a destination guide from the Dominican Republic to promote the industry abroad, and we plan to participate in numerous trade shows and fairs.</p>]]></richbody0content>

Could you tell us more about its main highlights and facilities?<br></h4><p>I arrived at Clí­nica Abreu in 1982, the year that the previous surgical ward was built. We have now rebuilt it and relocated the surgical facilities to the 3rd floor following an investment in new equipment of over $1 million. We have four brand new surgical operating rooms equipped with the best devices, and we specialize in digestive surgery, which has been a popular and consistent service in the history of Clí­nica Abreu. The clinic has long been a prominent institution for surgical services, which is why we completed the joint venture in 2008 with our Venezuelan partners (Grupo CDD Global), during which I insisted on focusing on rebuilding the surgical facilities and developing a new service for cancer patients, the radiotherapy division. We have the best linear accelerator on the market for the treatment of diverse cancers, and have the only training program for radiotherapy specialists in the country, as no other program is training specialists in managing cancer with the right radiation therapy.</p><h4>Clinica Abreu works in partnership with Grupo CDD Global. Why did you sign this agreement and what are the main benefits coming from it?</h4><p>I assumed the management of Clí­nica Abreu in 2000, replacing Dr. Jordi Brossa after his 43 years as head of the clinic. Even though we have tremendous prestige, including in terms of services offered to diplomatic delegations from abroad, I concluded that if we continued using the same administrative system we would fail to advance. I therefore decided to seek a potential partnership and for this reason began making contacts in Venezuela. We now have a joint venture that has been extremely positive in terms of the growth of this institution. We have been growing because of the presence of the Venezuelan investors, and have already closed a business operation and purchased a new property in the north part of the city. We have 6,000 sqm dedicated to the new Clí­nica Abreu, and the project is ready to commence in January of 2018. The clinic will offer 160 specialist outpatient services, with the best divisions and advisors available, especially in surgical services, which have traditionally been strong at our institution.</p><h4>The clinic is mostly known for its excellent cancer treatment center. Can you tell us more about its facilities and the technologies used?</h4><p>The linear accelerator that we have is extremely advanced technology. We acquired that through our Venezuelan partners because they have four or five cancer centers in Venezuela and three in Colombia. They have tremendous expertise, and because of my 30-year experience in a public hospital managing the gynecological cancer department, I decided to find information on those companies adept at cancer management. This cancer center has had phenomenal success, and opened another identical branch on October 30th in La Romana. We have set up a CCD radiotherapy center. It is a great pleasure to have had the opportunities I have had over the past 30 years, to help women with cancer. I have a preference for looking after cancer patients, which is why I have been pushing my partners to do so. That is my main goal, and I think that Clí­nica Abreu is heading in that direction.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of the logistics center with one-stop shopping services you are currently developing, and what are the prospects for this initiative?<br></h4><p>The Caucedo Logistics Center has actually been a part of our business plan from the outset. We have now been operating for 11 years and there have been many phases of development of the port, although this marks the next major step in its growth. The idea of building the logistics center is to attract greater volume into the Dominican Republic, which will help to grow the local economy and create jobs. Today we employ around 1,000 people in the port, but at the logistics center, there is the potential for huge growth in the economy and in employment. We have an area of land of about 40 hectares currently being developed. We have the option to develop a further 80 hectares making a total of 120 hectares. We see this as an opportunity to develop growth and further promote the Dominican Republic as a cargo hub. We have been highly successful over the past 11 years, having started out with a port that basically only handled local cargo, which we have transformed into a hub. Today there is roughly a 50:50 split between transshipment and local cargo. In 2015 we expect to grow volumes even further, which will facilitate international commerce.</p><h4>How do you evaluate Caucedo's performance in 2014 and its contribution to the local economy?</h4><p>We are a key point in the local economy. On a national basis, about 60% of the cargo going in and out of the country comes through here. In the captive market, we handle about 64.5% of the cargo. This is also able to attract international businesses on the strength of our sizable port. In terms of performance, we are in the top tier and we can offer world-class infrastructure with the same capacities you would find in the US, Europe and Asia.  We have automated certain functions to expedite business with Caucedo, and to migrate away from manual and paper-based work to the online environment, all to make it easier for our customers to do business with us, and the Dominican Republic more competitive.</p><h4>What is the significance of the partnership with DP World, one of the largest maritime terminal operators in the world?</h4><p>I consider ours a good combination. DP World operates more than 60 ports around the world and we bring the knowhow on operating the port, while it is also a challenge for a global company to enter and manage 60 different local cultures or environments. As a result, having a local partner is extremely important. We contribute equally to the partnership and success of Caucedo.</p><h4>What role does security play at Caucedo?</h4><p>We now hold all possible certifications. Security in this region is an important topic, and we are all unfortunately challenged by a certain trade in illegal commodities, which we actively seek to prevent. We enjoy close cooperation with the local authorities and US authorities, with both being present at the port, and we are, again, fully certified. One difference here is that we are part of the container security initiative. We are the only Port in the Dominican Republic to have a scanner to check cargo for contraband and illegal commodities, and are looking to enhance our scanning capabilities to the point where the latest technology allows us to penetrate the entire container to identify suspicious materials. Early in 2015 we will have in place one of the most efficient and modern scanners available on the market today, increasing the number of scanners in Caucedo to two.</p><h4>What other plans are set for 2015?</h4><p>The key considerations for us are developing the Port Community System, continuing to grow our Cacuedo Logistic Center, and further preparing the Port for the opening of the Panama Canal. In 2015 we will deepen the current draft of the port from 13.5m to 15m, which will enable the port to the receive larger vessels once the Panama Canal expansion is completed. On smaller projects, we seek ways to reduce our CO2 footprint and save energy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is Haina adapting to the expansion of the Panama Canal, and how will it impact the shipping industry in the Dominican Republic?<br></h4><p>Haina is the largest multi-purpose port in the country handling around 60% of total maritime traffic, which includes container, bulk, general cargo, and other types of vessels. Our focus is on intra regional trade, especially with the US, and on serving feeder vessels that come from other transshipping hubs in the Caribbean, and that in turn connect us to the rest of the world. The canal expansion impacts, for the most part, what are called long-haul routes, for example the Far East to North America, whereby the immediate direct impact for Haina will be limited. The expansion of the Canal is expected to reduce logistics costs due to the economies of scale of the much larger vessels that will now be able to cross, although that does not directly translate into increased regional trade as some have suggested. The reality is that growth in maritime trade is driven mainly by the economic development of the individual countries. There will be an increase in demand for transshipment services for the larger vessels, and multiple countries including the Dominican are competing to capture it.</p><h4>Haina was the first Dominican Port to receive ISO9001-2008 certification and the first company in the country to receive Authorized Economic Operator certification. What role does security play in your operations?</h4><p>Security is of the essence. The port is ISPS-certified by the International Maritime Organization, and any terminal active in the global market requires this security certification. We were also certified as compliant with the Customer-Trade Partnership against Terrorism program (C-TPAT) by the US Customs and Border Patrol in 2011, only the fifth port outside the US to be certified. We have also been certified by the Business Alliance for Secure Commerce (BASC), which is a global non-profit organization driven by the private sector that develops and sets world-class standards for security. We were the first company in the Dominican Republic to be certified as an authorized economic operator (AEO), which is a security certification provided by the World Customs Organization. All of this has required substantial investment in basic infrastructure and technology, as well as establishing rigorous control processes. We have the best CCTV system in the country with  more than 130 strategically located cameras and a modern  monitoring center, and we maintain recordings for at least three months. We are in the late stages of implementing biometric access control in all restricted areas of the port. In addition we also use the NAVIS terminal operating system, globally the most widely used.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the country's potential to become a future regional hub in the Caribbean?</h4><p>We have been taking advantage of our privileged geographic location ever since the colonization of the island; the Spanish crown used the Dominican Republic as a hub, and much cargo came from South and Central America to be shipped to Europe from here. Today, we have nine international airports, 13 maritime ports, three of them of a major scale, and an extensive highway system. What we need is the legal framework to be able to receive, manage, and re-export cargo that is in transit within a no tax regime. This will allow us to perform value-added activities for that cargo such as re-packaging or re-labeling.</p><h4>What is the importance of public—private partnerships (PPP) for the further development of the Dominican maritime industry?</h4><p>Within the context of a port, one sees the complex intersection of diverse stakeholders, both private and public. Haina International Terminals is an excellent example of what can be achieved when a PPP works correctly. This port used to be a government-run facility, but unfortunately investment had not kept pace with growth, and infrastructure had suffered notably. Under the umbrella of private investment, Haina has become a world-class port and not only survived, but also thrived. Meanwhile, our port operating committee allows stakeholders to focus on continuous improvement at monthly structural meetings. This is one of the reasons we can achieve such results as 60-minute turnover times to pick up cargo.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In what sectors are Schad's services most required, and what customers are you targeting?<br></h4><p>Schad mainly serves the consumer goods, food and beverage, pharmaceuticals, technology, and telecommunications industries. Our motto is “get there first." So, for example, pharmaceuticals is an important sector for us because of the time-sensitive focus. We are also active in the free zone manufacturing sector, which has a large component of medical device firms. In term of clients, we focus on multinationals and large national companies, mainly because these are the organizations that are more advanced in their logistics planning and are willing to outsource.</p><h4>What is the importance of your partnership with Deutsche Post DHL, and its role in the overall development of Schad?</h4><p>DHL Global Forwarding has been our partner for more than 40 years. Branding-wise, it is important for us because DHL is the number-one logistics company in the world. However, more important than this is the network that DHL has. While Schad's presence is in the Dominican Republic, we have access to the offices of DHL everywhere in the world, permitting us to serve customers along the entire global supply chain, from origin all the way to the end consumer.</p><h4>What innovations and technologies is Schad using for its operations?</h4><p>We are implementing automated warehouse management systems that are controlled by radio frequency, which gives us immediate data and inventory visibility. Within the transport sector, we have an in-house Transportation Management System that controls our 250 trucks while being monitored by GPS. In 2014, we are also implementing a business process management system as well as an electronic document storage and retrieval system, which aims to improve our overall process efficiencies.</p><h4>What have been the major milestones for Schad in 2014?</h4><p>During 2014, we have consolidated our trucking network to provide daily coverage to all the municipalities of the Dominican Republic. Our logistics operation in the eastern part of the island was consolidated, and now offers customs brokerage, warehousing, and distribution from our center in Punta Cana, mainly to serve the tourism sector. These services guarantee our customers same-day deliveries with over 99% accuracy. Looking to reduce risks, several projects were successfully completed ending with our Business Alliance for Secure Commerce certification.</p><h4>In August 2013, SOFOS unveiled the country's biggest rooftop solar panel array, at your logistics complex. What is the importance of this investment for the development of the country's energy sector?</h4><p>We feel good that our green energy production is equivalent to the consumption of over 100 homes. It is also a sound economic decision earning a positive return on investment. The Dominican Republic has long had a problem regarding electricity, with high costs, irregular production, and blackouts. We are heading in the right direction to improve that. We applaud the government's decision to provide incentives to ensure more green energy is produced. Schad also has a second such facility, which came online in July. The new project is in our truck terminal, and is about half the size of the first one.</p><h4>How would you assess the current condition of the logistics sector in the Dominican Republic and the country's potential to become a future regional hub?</h4><p>I think, as a country, we have an adequate and comparatively modern infrastructure. Established service providers such as airlines, ocean cargo liners, land transport companies, logistics operators, and warehousing companies, offer multiple competitive services. The Dominican Republic just needs two more things, the first being the legal framework that will enable the country to become a hub. Under the current framework, it is too expensive and time consuming to import and export products as a transshipment hub. We are already working with the presidency and the customs authority on a new regulatory framework. Secondly, regarding education, we still need quite a bit more development. There is a need for more in-depth specialized training in our industry. Currently, almost everyone in this sector learns on the job. The academic sector offering is a necessary ingredient for the competitiveness of the Dominican Republic.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is African Barrick Gold (ABG) working to increase the level of local content?<br></h4><p>When I joined we had an office in Johannesburg, with a staff of over 200 people. We are relocating all but 25 to Dar es Salaam to our new premises. Those roles have been given to Tanzanians. Even at our mines, we have reduced the number of expatriates from over 500 to about 300 over the past few months, and that number will continue to decline.</p><h4>How has your experience in Tanzania helped you in your expansion plans for other countries in the region?</h4><p>We are the largest private employer in the country and the largest power contributor in the country. We are also the largest taxpayer. ABG has been here now for nearly 15 years, and it was one of the first companies to establish a foothold here when the mining industry was opened up to private enterprise. We have done well out of it—and so has Tanzania—as a result of our presence. Tanzania will always be our hub, although we do have an active exploration program in Kenya. One day that may become a second operating country if it develops into a mine. We are looking at opportunities in West Africa as well. ABG hopes to be a significant player on the African content, with Tanzania being the center of gravity.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on ABG's plans regarding exploration?</h4><p>Most of our opportunities in Tanzania are immediately around our three mines. We did have a large land bank in Tanzania, though we have now relinquished about 80% of that so that it can pass on to the next generation of miners. There are several junior explorers that have entered the country to start reworking that ground, which in itself creates a new economy in mining and exploration.</p><h4>What brownfield projects are you focusing on in the near term?</h4><p>The company has been losing money for some time; however, we are happy to acknowledge that we are starting to make money today even at the prevailing low gold prices. We have dropped our cost base by more than one-third over the past year. The primary focus for us is to fix the three mines. Next, we need to look at how we can improve their production and to examine the other resources we can mine at each of those three locations. We are doing quite a bit of drilling in and around the mines and deeper below them. At North Mara, for example, we think we will be going underground for the first time in 2015 from operating an open mine. And meanwhile, Bulyanhulu is a world-class deposit with nearly 20 million ounces running at around 10 grams per ton. Based upon today's numbers that will suffice for another 30 or 40 years. With the additional drilling we are doing on reef one and reef two we expect that that will be 50 years plus, making it a fantastic asset. I am glad it is ours and not someone else's.</p><h4>What are your targets for 2015?</h4><p>In 2013, we produced 640,000 ounces. In 2014, we are aiming for between 640,000 and 690,000 ounces. In 2015, we will be significantly higher than that, mainly driven by the improvement at Bulyanhulu. We are aiming to almost double the overall production level from that underground mine. That will be a significant achievement. I look forward to registering an annualized run rate of 350,000 ounces at Bulyanhulu by the end of 2015.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>Tanzania is ahead of the curve compared with most African countries in terms of the liberalization of the ICT market. How has this liberalization translated into greater economic efficiency in the overall economy of Tanzania?<br></h4><p>There has been considerable growth in the communications sector, which can be attributed to the attractive legal and regulatory environment, which enables businesses to run and operate far more efficiently overall.</p><h4>What kind of regulatory reform do you think is needed to increase the level of innovation in the country?</h4><p>The strength of our framework is that it is long term and designed to absorb future developments and trends in the ICT sector. We introduced this framework in 2005, but at that time when we were talking about infrastructure people were thinking mainly about the wireless infrastructure. Our infrastructure was technology-neutral, whereby it did not matter whether it was wireless, fiber, submarine, or digital in nature. This is why the same framework serves numerous uses. The Application Services License is open ended, and has proven useful in both financial services and mobile banking applications.</p><h4>Have other countries approached you regarding this model?</h4><p>We receive many visitors, and also participate in a number of regional and international bodies. We are members of the East African Communications Organization (EACO) along with Kenya, Uganda, Burundi, and Rwanda. In the EACO, there is a firm tradition of countries sharing knowledge with each other. Southern African countries have the Communication Regulators Association of Southern Africa (CRASA), in which there is a similar exchange of ideas and experiences. The ICT sector features global, continental, and regional organizations. We have held meetings with global companies too, such as ITU Telecoms, based in Switzerland, and also with XO Communications, a satellite communications company based in the US. There is always much to learn from such meetings and conferences, which help a company figure out how to adapt to fit the local environment. You have to do so in order to expand your horizons, while remaining on top of global developments and developing your own capabilities.</p><h4>What factors would you say are unique to Tanzania's ICT sector?</h4><p>In terms of financial and mobile services, people in the West with credit and debit cards, for example, have no real need for such services. Here, credit card penetration is low, and so is the number of people holding debit cards. Meanwhile, in terms of mobile communications, we have 28 million SIM card subscribers. By leveraging communications and banking you better serve these people.</p><h4>What challenges remain for the sector?</h4><p>Cyber security is a challenge, whether for mobile networks or the internet. Another challenge is the misuse of ICT, be it for negative publicity, pornography, or abusive or derogatory material. One way we are planning to counter this is through the establishment of the Computer Emergency Response Team Regulations (TZ-CERT), which will specifically deal with the issue of cyber security. The TCRA would be the focal point through which we connect all the key structures, such as e-government offices, mobile companies, and banks to mitigate cyber threats. TZ-CERT has been established to deal specifically with such threats. It connects us with the global community, and we will receive warning of suspicious activity or possible threats from foreign agencies, which will then alert TZ-CERT.</p><h4>What efforts are you undertaking for greater nationwide access to ICT, including rural areas?</h4><p>This is another challenge. We have to ensure our communications services cover rural areas as well. We do this in two ways: first, we monitor our license rollout plans, and secondly, our government has established a special institution for this, known as the Universal Communications Services Access Fund. Its main role is to ensure that communications services reach rural areas. The program is still slow, but we will see in the coming years how this goes.</p><h4>Do you think there is room for more competition?</h4><p>The lack of room for other competitors is mainly due to the lack of necessary resources to enter this sector; however, it is a dynamic sector. Most countries have three or four competitors, but we have five, which I consider healthy.</p><h4>What objectives do you hope to achieve in the short term?</h4><p>We need stronger enforcement of regulations to ensure a high quality of service in the communications matrix, for consumer rights, and to reduce tariffs. Broadcasting has become digitized, which is a significant development for Tanzania. We have already licensed three digital signal disputers, which are already in place. Dar es Salaam switched off in December 31, 2012, followed by Dodoma and Tanga, and then Mosherusha and Mwaza. That was Phase I. In Phase II, we switched off Dobora, Singida, Bukoba, and Musoma. By the end of 2014, we hope Tanzania will be completely digitized. It has taken two years because we wanted to make sure our legal and regulatory framework was correct, and we also wanted to consult the stakeholders, the business community, the public, and politicians. We had to convince everyone that digitization was about socio-economic development.</p><h4>Where do you think the ICT sector is headed in Tanzania?</h4><p>The future is still bright, and Tanzania has only a 60% penetration rate for telecommunications. There is a lot of potential for growth. In terms of infrastructure, we are laying submarine cables for Dar es Salaam, and then we have the national ICT infrastructure project. Our regional headquarters is connected, so our focus is now on connecting the more rural parts of the country. In digital broadcasting, the major channel will be local content. In terms of internet growth, we need to bring many government services to the web and to mobile devices as well, so we are going to expand our e-government services. In the postal segment, we are changing all the post office boxes into physical addresses.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How much more room for growth is there before the telecoms market becomes saturated?<br></h4><p>The market already has about 60% penetration, and given the child-to-adult ratio, in terms of population with disposable income, the figure is probably close to 85% penetration today. Furthermore, the Tanzanian market has one of the lowest rates in Africa, whereby most tariffs are low in Africa. Given that I do not foresee any more than three or four players operating profitably in this market in the long term, it will be difficult for a fifth operator to enter profitably, given the state of the tariffs, the capacity, and the penetration.</p><h4>What are Airtel's main competitive advantages over the other telcos?</h4><p>The first competitive advantage is our network, which is the widest in Tanzania. It offers access to many rural regions of Tanzania, and this yields a clear competitive advantage.  I would highlight our sales and distribution spread, as well as the width and depth of this market. I also believe that the consumer has started relating to our propositions and the range in the composite new market through our Yatosha campaign, and more our recent and ongoing Switch On data-oriented campaign which is geared to the youth market.</p><h4>What are Airtel's strategies on the widening of its rural distribution?</h4><p>Our distribution approach is for each village to have a store. Once this primary target is reached it must be able to sell a range of services ranging from airtime and SIM cards to Airtel Money. The second part of the strategy involves consumers accepting the advantage that Airtel Money, a mobile payment system, has to offer in terms of purchasing their daily needs, be that food or other basic services. We cover around 86% of Tanzania today.</p><h4>Airtel recently upgraded's Mobile Money platform. Can you please elaborate on the investment in technology to enhance your product offering?</h4><p>We are making significant investment in all areas, and we have, for instance, allocated around $2 million in the Mobile Money platform alone. The second major investment we have realized is to our billing platform, which will enable a more flexible billing system for our high-value and corporate customers. Thirdly, we are set to make significant investments in the 3G and Data Services arena.</p><h4>How do you see mobile money developing in Tanzania, and how will Airtel further incorporate this trend?</h4><p>In terms of value and turnover, it probably constitutes 30% to 40% of GDP. It has to be the natural means of paying and receiving payment, and is destined to become the next business transformation we will undergo. Mobile money when needed becomes ready cash, and is changing the way we buy goods and services, as well as the way that we save and earn interest, all on a common platform. This is not only a commercial transformation, but one with the capacity to impact the whole economy. We need to embrace this technology and to get it right.</p><h4>What is Airtel's strategy regarding social media?</h4><p>Looked at from a consumer perspective, the tendency is to go online via social media, and therefore the primary use of the internet will either be through Facebook, Twitter, or Whatsapp. Tanzania's population is young, with a median age of around 16 or 17 years of age. It is at this age that communication becomes all about friends and relationships. In addition, there is the influence of the diaspora abroad.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance of the Tanzanian market for Serengeti Breweries?<br></h4><p>We are a substantial investor in Tanzania, which is the fifth largest beer market in Africa. GDP growth has been running at between 6% and 7% over the past seven years, in excess of 50% of the population is under 30, and we are likely to see significant growth of the middle class. All of these elements lead to a highly attractive market and we have strong brands at play. Currently, the market size is significant as, indeed, is the informal market. A number of opportunities present themselves as a result. We have invested strongly in our brands and in innovation. Clearly in the spirit market, we note that an emerging middle class will tend to gravitate toward spirit brands like Johnnie Walker, Baileys, and Smirnoff. We are well prepared and confident in our potential to deliver in this market.</p><h4>How is Serengeti Breweries working to increase the level of local sourcing?</h4><p>We are hugely pleased with the progress we have made with our agribusiness in Tanzania. We have a dedicated agribusiness team who work with farmers to improve yields through an improved variety of seeds and agronomy and are proud of the results we have achieved with the many farmers with whom we work. Currently, we are working in collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture on a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). Our objective is to halve the level of imported raw materials and double our local production. To do this, we need to encourage and develop more barley farming in the country, and considerable work with farmers has been done on this front. Currently, we have 52 farmers engaged as partners with us, and we expect to yield between 6,000 and 8,000 tons of barley in 2014. It is an exciting project as it benefits both the farmers and our company. It is important that the government continues to support this type of partnership, which supports local production. We have our own local beer brands, such as Senator, Kibo, Kick, and Pilsner, which are made of 100% local raw materials. It is possible to reach 100% local sourcing for all of our beer brands. The current limiting factor is the crop yield from the farms. Therefore, providing that barley farmers remain competitive, there is no reason why our business shouldn't look to achieve 95%—100% beer production utilizing locally sourced raw materials.</p><h4>What is the extent of government support for this initiative?</h4><p>We enjoy excellent relations with the Ministry of Agriculture and with the Tanzania Investment Center. We currently work with all relevant stakeholders and are developing a significant barley sector.</p><h4><br>Is the domestic barley supply adequate?</h4><p>We would ideally need to double the cultivated area, so there is still a long way to go before we reap the crop's full potential. The challenge with barley is that it has to be grown at a particular altitude, and there are only specific regions in this country, such as West Kilimanjaro, that are suitable for this crop.</p><h4>How are farmers responding to this move toward cash crop production?</h4><p>They have been receptive, despite the challenging transition from subsistence agriculture. We provide various services for selected farmers including seed and educational programs. This year alone, we have provided 300 tons of seed to farmers. We have one anchor agri-business manager supported by a team of advisors, but the main responsibility lies with the Ministry of Agriculture, which we partner with.</p><h4>What are your short-term targets?</h4><p>From a brewing perspective, we recently garnered three Monde Selection quality awards for our outstanding beers. We won a gold medal for Kibo Gold, a silver medal for Serengeti brewed at our Dar es Salaam plant, and two gold medals for Serengeti brewed at our Mwanza plant. This confirms our brands are of the highest quality and have been recognized internationally over the past two years. We have put a lot of investment into our business, and I am confident we now have a good base for future growth.</p><h4>How much of what you produce is exported?</h4><p>We are primarily interested in satisfying the increasing demand from our Tanzanian consumers. In addition, logistically speaking, exporting from Tanzania into neighboring markets is extremely challenging in terms of cross border movement. That being said, we do export beer to Kenya, and Serengeti can be found in select outlets in London.</p><h4>What is your long-term outlook for the beer sector in Tanzania?</h4><p>The branded beer and spirits sector in Tanzania is increasingly vibrant, and I believe that this is a good thing for our industry. We have a wide portfolio of brands that will continue to satisfy consumers in every segment of the population. We believe that Tanzania presents untapped opportunities that we are well placed to exploit. As the market develops, I think we will see people trading up from cloudy to clear beer. That has been the trend in most markets; as incomes rise, people trade up in qualitative terms. I also think that we will see a move into spirits, especially international brands, as people seek to drink better, but less. We are well placed to serve both of these trends. Moreover, we are invested in the long term. Therefore, we will build long-term relationships with suppliers, consumers, and the government.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>ADVENT Construction Limited was the first construction company in the country to be ISO certified. In what other ways would you say ADVENT is a pioneer in the field?<br></h4><p>If I am not mistaken, we were the only construction company to be fully enterprise resource planning (ERP) integrated. We have a software system that runs across all fronts of the company, right from the projects to the central stores and logistics. ADVENT Construction Limited was the first company to invest a lot of time and money in doing something like that, which basically means that all our products across the country are linked to the head office, from the ordering system through to project management. In terms of technology we had a budget in 2014 of about $4.5 million, which is for equipment alone. Aside from this, we continue implementing software upgrades and adding to what we are already doing in terms of integration for all of our projects. Unlike most other construction companies, we do work all across the country. We have nationwide coverage to consider. We have software and hardware links, and internet access in isolated parts of Tanzania is a must. That is the major line of investment we consider. As a construction company, technology is key, both in terms of hardware and the equipment being used, but also in terms of software and infrastructure requirements. We make it a point to allocate a significant part of our budget to reinvestment.</p><h4>What are ADVENT Construction's strategies to cater to the growing demands of Tanzania's emerging energy sector?</h4><p>We developed the major supply base for Schlumberger in Mtwara. We also performed some work for Shell, and are on the tender list for BG, and basically, for all the major players. Oil and gas is a department within the company that we are trying to nourish. Mozambique is active in that field, and we have already set up a dedicated office there. We have a regional office in Mtwara, and were the first construction company to set up a full-time regional office there, primarily because we are the only construction company in Tanzania that really meets the standards required by the oil and gas industry. As a result, we have been quite successful in getting projects from the industry.</p><h4>ADVENT Construction Limited established itself in Tanzania 22 years ago. What opportunities in the sector exist today that weren't available at that time?</h4><p>We work in a wholly different landscape today. Mid-level housing is now in great demand. Oil and gas is also an entirely new sector for the nation. We are working on larger projects than before, and meanwhile, the market is also becoming much more sophisticated. Clients are demanding, as are the consultants, and the engineering technology being used is a lot more sophisticated. Moreover, everything is a lot more in line with what developed countries are doing. We are trying to bring new technology and engineering practices into the country. As a large company with many resources at our disposal, we obviously have an advantage because in being able to access resources from overseas, we can bring in people with the necessary knowledge to get these projects completed.</p><h4>What is your long-term vision for the company?</h4><p>We want to replicate what some of the more successful European companies have done, which is to exist for over 100 years, and branch out into all parts of the world. Africa is of course our primary area of expertise, but we'd like to be able to spread out as far as the business will allow us to.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the recent performance of the National Housing Corporation (NHC)?<br></h4><p>The performance of the NHC has continued to improve, and I think we have maintained the slot and are still doing well. The NHC has invested more in the execution of our strategic plan, focusing on six key elements. We aim to become a leading real estate developer, to become an efficient real estate manager, and to strengthen operational efficiency and control mechanisms. We have also put more emphasis on brand issues, and have maintained strong relationships with our tenants and potential customers. We are now completing a customer satisfaction survey to find out if our clients are happy with the services we provide. In addition, we are carrying out a staff satisfaction survey to get feedback from our employees to see which practices are working and which are not.</p><h4>What were the main strategies behind the NHC's decision to commit to its satellite city projects?</h4><p>NHC has three different business portfolios. One of them is to improve the existing cities, so we are trying to combine local properties situated in strategic areas to create something meaningful that will remain for another 40 to 50 years. The second portfolio deals with affordable housing, and our aim is to deliver affordable and good quality housing for local groups. Affordable housing should be the focus of the local authorities, too. The third portfolio, satellite cities, is also important for us. Within this portfolio, the NHC acts as a master developer. We will welcome developers in some of the satellite projects. As a master developer, we have to ensure that the master plan is delivered correctly. We are responsible for providing infrastructure to those who are participating in the projects. We already have four satellite cities and have another six to be built. Two of those are in Dar es Salaam, and we have two separate satellite cities in Arusha. They are not competing but rather complementing each other. We aim to create a community in those satellite areas where people can live, shop, have offices, and use recreational areas. Every project has a key feature; some of them have more office areas, business, and commercial facilities with residential areas to support them or vice versa. In some of the areas, we are targeting all classes of potential residency. Manza is another region to keep an eye on. It is the largest city in the north-west of the country. We are also looking at opportunities for establishing satellite cities in Mbeya and Dodoma. Most of these projects take five to 10 years to complete. To qualify as a satellite city, an area needs to be more than 1 million sqm in size.</p><h4>How will the NHC finance these projects?</h4><p>The financing differs across projects. We have enough sources for some of the projects, and we are also borrowing for some others. We intend to do to encourage more developers to participate. One of our options is to sell plots of land to investors. We also run some road shows outside the country to generate interest. Recently, we have organized a road show in Dubai, following successful ones in Tokyo and Singapore. We are focusing mostly on attracting developers from South East Asia, the Middle East, and China. Recently, we have also started to consider Europe.</p><h4>How would you assess the level of interest from foreign private investors in these projects?</h4><p>I think it has been quite high. One of the main reasons is that people understand that Africa is changing, and they see the various improvements in economy, management, and politics taking place in Africa recently. The continent is rich in resources, and human capital is one of its strengths, too. The average age is lower than that of other continents, so there is a larger working population than in China or India. NHC also has the biggest balance sheet in the country. We are the largest player in the real estate sector in Central and East Africa. We have the largest number of units. Management is also important to attract investment. We are trying to build an institution that is managed professionally, as we need to convince investors to come and put their money into housing.</p><h4>What are the remaining concerns among potential investors, and how can these be addressed in the future?</h4><p>They may have a few concerns. However, partnership with the NHC helps to resolve them. Other issues need to be addressed by the authorities. One of the main problems that needs resolution is property ownership for foreign nationals. The legislation that deals with this area should be updated.</p><h4>What are your main goals for 2015?</h4><p>By the end of 2015, we need to achieve every goal that we have set in the strategic plan for 2010-2015. We have already reached some of them, but it will also be the time for us to design a new strategic plan that should consider our achievements, financial situation, and human capital. One of the goals in the coming strategic plan is to make sure to have enough units in every area. The elections are coming soon, so people will be asking for housing. We will also need to improve our financial positions for finding alternative sources of raising money and selling more of our properties. We need to work on leadership and human capital issues, and will need to make sure we are able to sustain our success.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the Ministry working to support Tanzanian entrepreneurs in the ICT sector?<br></h4><p>The Ministry of Communication, Science, and Technology, through the Commission for Science and Technology (COSTECH), has established the only ICT/Technology Incubator in the region called Dar Teknohama Business Incubator (DTBi), to help ICT entrepreneurs create start-ups, and assist SMEs that will positively impact the economy and move the country closer to its Vision 2015 goals. In the two and a half years since it was formed as a public-private partnership (PPP) involving the government, the private sector, and the World Bank's InfoDev, it has accomplished much. Around 8,000 indirect and 300 direct jobs have been created across the country through entrepreneurial activities. The Ministry has encouraged ICT entrepreneurs to help solve problems in different ministries, departments, agencies, and communities. For example, an online application system for the Tanzania Commission for Universities, a management information system for the Ministry of Communication, Science, and Technology, consultations for the information system of the Immigration Department, financial inclusion through points of sale in rural and urban centers that assist local governments and the Tanzania Communication Regulatory Authority (TCRA), and support for increased revenue collection in local governments/municipalities at an increase of about 300% have been some of the projects developed under its authority. The Ministry has also advocated a better ICT entrepreneurship ecosystem. Support for the creation of the Mwananchi Business Partnership Agency to help tech-entrepreneurs create innovative solutions for the extractive industry with an emphasis on women's empowerment has been successful. The Ministry also works with ICT entrepreneurs in the country to establish different working environments (such as innovation spaces), which enable ICT entrepreneurs to meet and design various ICT-related projects. Sending ICT entrepreneurs to participate in international competitions such as the ITU Competition or the Silicon Valley Competition has been another focus of the organization.</p><h4>The ICT sector currently contributes roughly 2.3% of the country's GDP. What do you expect the figure to be in the next five years?</h4><p>I expect it to represent around 10% of GDP, as our government has already invested heavily in building a resilient high-speed broadband network. We have the Universal Communications Services Access Fund, which facilitates service providers to reach under-served areas. In addition, we have potential investors willing to contribute to bridge the current digital divide. With better technology to monitor the traffic of mobile operators, coupled with the introduction of new laws and the Tanzania Computer Emergency Response Team (TzCERT), more effective control of the sector will allow it to contribute more to GDP.</p><h4>Dar es Salaam is set to be the fifth “Wireless Internet City" in Africa with free internet zones. What effect will this have on the city?</h4><p>The city has a 91-kilometer, optical fiber network covering every access area of the city. The process of transforming Dar es Salaam into a Wireless Internet City has already begun. The Muhimbili National Hospital is one of the busiest service areas in the city at present. Our aim is to continue with our initiatives to roll the service out to all other referral hospitals, shopping malls, and public areas within the city in an effort to ensure that there is free access to mobile broadband services. Having free internet in a city like Dar es Salaam has been one of the national goals in the fourth phase of a government program aimed at bridging the digital divide and enabling even middle and low income businesses, entrepreneurs, and students to benefit from free internet zones. The communication sector is the leading sector in Tanzania, given that its annual growth stood at 22.8% in 2013, up from 20.6% in 2012.</p><h4>What is the Ministry's strategy to close the digital divide, particularly in rural Tanzania?</h4><p>The Ministry's strategy is mainly concentrated around fostering investment in the National ICT Broadband Backbone (NICTBB) project, the Rural Telecommunication Project, the Schools Connectivity Project, the National Addressing and Postcode System, the establishment of an ICT Park, Research and Development Projects, and the improvement of health services through Telemedicine.</p><h4><br>How would the Ministry assess the opportunities for private investment, both domestic and foreign, in the ICT sector?</h4><p>There are many opportunities, which are assured by the Ministry, as the market for services in the ICT sector is high and constantly growing. Furthermore, having a high-speed network in place, connections to international sea cables, zero-tax on computers, and an effective and efficient regulatory environment for communications will together offer major opportunities in the ICT sector.</p><h4>What are the Ministry's priorities for 2015?</h4><p>We aim to establish a National ICT Mega Data Center, particularly in Dar es Salaam, Dodoma, and Zanzibar. We also plan to roll out a new physical addressing and postcode system, which will comprehensively identify streets and individual residences to stimulate and facilitate governance and the delivery of mail, the issuing of loans, tax and revenue collection, law enforcement, and emergency services. We will also be working to strengthen the Universal Communication Services Access Fund (UCAF).</p><h4>How would you rate Tanzania's current progress in the ICT sector within the government's Vision 2025 program?</h4><p>The ICT sector so far is doing well in bringing Tanzania closer to its Vision 2025. To start with, the completion of the National ICT Broadband Backbone and the establishment of links to international sea cables have established abundant data capacity at affordable rates. The ICT sector has created massive employment opportunities that have promoted a competitive economy. In addition, available ICT infrastructure facilitates applications such as e-learning, which in turn can nurture a well-educated society. In general, ICT has done much to create a platform for more to be done to achieve Tanzania's Vision 2025.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your main focuses and priorities for 2015?<br></h4><p>Nabaki Afrika is an independent company with a radically alternative approach to the market. Our broad focus is national growth and our priority is the Nabaki Afrika house—the business itself. The second focus is the family, my employees who run the business. And the third is the product range we import into Tanzania. Most important for us are our customers, whom we serve and support. Regarding the Nabaki house, we are expanding our branches over 2014 and 2015, and have recently signed a lease in Arusha for a 420-sqm showroom. We have three other branches in Dar es Salaam, and are also looking for local distributors in smaller towns around the country, such as Mwanza, Tanga, and Moshi. Yet where distributors do not prove to be successful, we establish a full branch given a viable market. In Mtwara, we have started franchising Nabaki Afrika. We do not charge for the franchise, but help entrepreneurs set up their business. We train their team, provide marketing assistance and know-how where needed, while they manage and develop their own, new business.</p><h4>How receptive has the Tanzanian construction sector been to the newer “green" products that you have introduced onto the market?</h4><p>It has been surprisingly receptive actually. Tanzania is a very cost-conscious society. However, people have realized that a cheap buy is often a bad buy as cheap products don't last. People are now taking the longer-term view, which has won us much support for the products, which in turn support our customers.</p><h4>Could you elaborate on Nabaki Afrika's Mtaalam Program?</h4><p>The Mtaalam Program is an interesting one. A “fundi" in the pure sense of the word is an “expert." In Tanzania the word fundi can, in some cases, be a derogatory word because everyone is a fundi. We realized this and took on the word 'mtaalam,' which is a Kiswahili word that means 'professional.' We decided on a free seminar to train fundis to become professionals. We do our practical training with the suppliers. We give the Mtaalams the tools to do the job properly, for free. To date, around 100 people have passed through the program. Of these, five have done exceptionally well and run very good businesses doing roof installations nationwide. We bought vehicles for those five businesses, and branded vehicles that they use as their own, which has allowed them to expand their business. Ours has become a relationship of mutual support and trust</p><h4>What new trends are you witnessing in Tanzania's construction sector?</h4><p>Tanzania is often ahead of other developed or developing countries. For example, Nabaki Afrika imports a Canadian product called Xypex—the most phenomenal waterproofing system available today. Xypex grows an insoluble crystal into the concrete making it waterproof for 30 years. Xypex is available as an admixture, a brush-on 'concentrate' and a 'patch n plug' repair mix. The trend is definitely to build better quality houses and buildings and more contractors have realized the hazards of cutting costs by using cheap products. Another important trend is building for the future, rather than for the moment. We are contacted daily by cheaper product manufacturers, but I don't want to increase my profits at the cost of reducing my standards. Tanzanians are not stuck on old trends; they are hungry for novelty.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>Tanzania's aviation sector has grown by double digits over the past few years. What are the main drivers behind this successful growth?<br></h4><p>We have experienced strong growth of between 12% and 16% recently. The driving force behind this is that Europeans and Westerners know about the tourist attractions in Tanzania. The government has worked extensively in terms of attracting more tourists to Tanzania, and we have more tourists arriving specifically to visit Kilimanjaro, Zanzibar, and Dar es Salaam, the three entry points into the country. Number two is the economic growth of 7.2% the country has experienced. Not many other countries are growing as fast as us, and we have among the highest economic growth rates worldwide. Still, we need to bring in more people, and to appeal more to the business community. Even the accessibility of the attractions within Tanzania, especially in terms of the airports we have constructed, has improved accessibility of attractions.</p><h4>Where does the Terminal 3 project currently stand, and what are your expectations for the terminal once completed?</h4><p>Traditionally, foreign or international passengers outnumbered their domestic counterparts, but now domestic passengers are growing with the introduction of fastjet, a low-cost carrier. Today, the breakdown is almost at 50:50. Our intention for Terminal 3 is to dedicate it to international passenger traffic. The existing airport will be dedicated to domestic passengers, while Terminal 1 will be for general aviation, such as private jets. The project is going well. We have a great contractor from the Netherlands, in the form of BAM International. It is a renowned contractor, and we have been working with it on infrastructure. To understand airports, there are two sides to consider: the airside and the landside. The first improvement we did for the airport was on the airside, whereby you can allow your aircraft to land and leave safely. By our standards, airside improvement has been completed, and was undertaken by BAM International in Phase I. Today, airside can accommodate eight planes landing and taking off. Our main customers for the airport are the airlines, ahead of the passengers themselves. We want the airline to land and leave safely. Landside is terminal three. We are currently undertaking improvement of the landside, including the parking of aircraft and passenger access to the terminal. This terminal building is going to increase the capacity of Dar es Salaam Airport from 1.5 million annual passengers to 7.5 million, and will take about 33 months to complete. It should open between February and March 2016 and will be a world-class facility.</p><h4>What are some investment opportunities that exist now for the Tanzania Airports Authority (TAA)?</h4><p>The private sector can come and operate in Dar es Salaam Airport. We are open to contract arrangement. In Dar es Salaam, apart from analytical services, there are also land and road services, such as shopping malls and hotels. If someone wants to come and invest in this area, we are willing to sit and talk with them. We are also willing to work with companies at Mtwara Airport, which is strategic for recent gas discoveries, and the new Msalato Airport at Dodoma, the political and capital city of the country. Meanwhile, in terms of airport improvements, there is significant growth potential.</p><h4>What is the current level of interest from foreign investors in these airports?</h4><p>There is an influx of investors from North America and the Far East. In response, we have been changing our traditionally bureaucratic system into one more conducive to doing business. We should be more proactive and progressive about receiving foreign investors and FDI, especially given the stable political climate. For example, we used to get seven KLM daily flights via Kilimanjaro, but now have 12 KLM movements here. Soon, we will fly from Kilimanjaro and Dar es Salaam to Amsterdam.</p><h4>What are your priorities for 2015?</h4><p>The key priority is to make all regional airports operational 24 hours a day. We used to lack paved runways or infrastructure. If an aircraft needs to go for maintenance checks, the number one consideration is landing and takeoff, and then periodic maintenance. Unpaved runways cause more wear and tear on aircraft, and if you check your fleet every 100 movements on a paved runway, you do so every 50 movements on an unpaved one, which is an added cost. My target is to reduce the costs of operators. The other thing is to provide a 24-hour service. In Tanzania, we operate six-to-six, making for a half day. How can you recover your investment with only half a day? You have to come up with high prices for passengers. However, if you allow them to operate 24 hours, and the airline has to be up 18 hours and down six hours for optimum utilization. In Tanzania, they don't even have 12 hours of operations, but 10. Another area I want to focus on is greater control over immigration. We don't want passengers to be inconvenienced by customs or immigration, and this requires regulatory change. The airport is a gateway to the country; it is the first impression people have of Tanzania, and first impressions last.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<url><![CDATA[one-lump-or-two]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize the progress of the Sugar Board's projects to triple Tanzania's sugar production?<br></h4><p>For the time being, we have lined up one new project that is about to come in. This is a business project carried out by Agro EcoEnergy. It is a greenfield project that aims at producing sugar and ethanol. The sugar will be produced in a volume of around 125,000 tons per year, and will also be diverted to ethanol, co-generation, and other by-products of sugarcane. The project is set to commence shortly, and the early works were launched in March 2014.</p><h4>What role will the private sector play in this project?</h4><p>Actually, the investment is supposed to come from the private sector. What we do is promote the project. We try to arrange for land to be placed under the brief of the Tanzania Investment Center (TIC), which then identifies potential investors for the sugarcane projects. The government may retain minority shares not exceeding 25%.</p><h4>Do you target Tanzanian investors, or investors from abroad?</h4><p>We do not discriminate, and the process is open and transparent. The opportunities will be advertised internationally, and there is considerable interest in investing in our sugar projects. The only hindrance has been finding unencumbered land, a bottleneck that we are making serious attempts to sort out.</p><h4>What are Tanzania's plans for exporting sugar?</h4><p>For the time being, we are deficit producers; however, we have the potential to become self-sufficient and even to export. We have an ambitious plan to become not just self-sufficient, but also to have at least 100,000 metric tons more for export to regional markets as well as international ones. We gave ourselves until the end of 2015 to be self-sufficient, but I think we were over ambitious in our assessment. Because of the land limits, I think we need three or four more years to become self-sufficient. When we start exporting, the first priorities will be the regional market. Subsequently, other markets, such as the EU, can be explored. Then, we have to be competitive to sell to the world market. Since the sugar regime is being reformed in the EU, we must be competitive. We have to lower our costs and maintain high-quality sugar so that we can access regional and world markets.</p><h4>How can Tanzania increase its production and the quality of its sugar?</h4><p>We have now embarked on a program of changing sugarcane varieties, as we have been using old varieties. These have caused low yields and they are susceptible to diseases and pests. We are now introducing new improved varieties that are high in sucrose content, with high yields, and are resistant to diseases and pests. With improved varieties, we can have higher yields and higher sucrose content; hence, the volume and quality will improve. If we have disease-free sugar cane, then the sugar that comes out of it is also of top quality, which can lead to better access to global markets. These new varieties of sugarcane are now being introduced through a project that was implemented through the Common Fund for Commodities (CFC). They funded a project to improve the varieties, which are now being propagated within East Africa for use by smallholder farmers and large estates.</p><h4>What role can the sugar industry play in developing Tanzania?</h4><p>First of all, the sugar industry is vital for promoting rural development. Smallholder farmers around large estates can farm cane, deliver it to the mills, and receive an income. Sugarcane is a lucrative way of generating income. Once growers are attracted toward farming sugarcane, then they can readily sell it to the mills, and improve their life standards. If you look at the areas surrounding the large sugar mills where the growers live, you observe substantially improved livelihoods.</p><h4>What legislative changes are needed to improve the power of this sector?</h4><p>We have recently changed the laws and regulations to try to create a conducive atmosphere for people to venture into sugarcane agriculture, and also be attracted to providing supplementary services to the sugar industry. We think that the present legal framework provides enough safeguards and incentives for stakeholders to enter the sugarcane business. We do see some challenges for the time being; for example, whenever there is a surplus in the world market, sugar gets directed into sugar deficit countries, or is smuggled in by illegal importers. This is a challenge against which we must protect our local industry in order for it to grow. We have to put up mechanisms and enforce laws in collaboration with other players and authorities, such as the police and revenue authorities, so that we can better enforce the laws and protect farmers. Any actor that brings in sugar that is not licensed by us commits an offence and will be penalized. That has been harming our industry as well as many others. Within the East African market, we all suffer from the same problems. In Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania, illegal imports are a common problem for all of us. We have to find means to stop the illegal sugar business.</p><h4>What are your main goals for 2014?</h4><p>We wanted to become self-sufficient, but I think it will take two or three years more to reach our goal because of the land limitations. However, we are making efforts in this direction and I think in the not-too-distant future we will have enough land to start these projects. We will need two or three more years. I think by 2018 we will be close to self-sustainability and self-sufficiency. The government is doing much to solve the problem of acquiring land for sugar production. There is already a task force to find land for investment into sugar and sugarcane. These efforts are underway, and, once we are done, this country will be self-sufficient and more. Once we get the land required, everything else will fall into place.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess the current position of the Tanzanian tourism sector, and what role can it play in future national development?<br></h4><p>Tourism is today almost the number one sector of the economy, and still growing fast. We received around 590,000 visitors in 2002, but in 2012 we reached the 1 million mark, and in 2013 we registered 1,135,834 arrivals. We expect to have reached our next target of 2 million visitors within two to three years. Tourism cuts across all sectors, generating employment opportunities and improving living standards. In addition, of course, it is a source of foreign currency, and, hence, a major sector of the economy.</p><h4>What is Tanzania doing to support diversification within the tourism sector?</h4><p>Our traditional offering is wildlife, and when considering the word safari, Tanzania is considered to be one of the best destinations throughout the world. Recently the New York Times announced that Tanzania was the number one destination in Africa in terms of safaris. But we have much more to offer, and cultural tourism is just one of our other products. We are trying to tell people that they can naturally come to Tanzania for the first time to the Serengeti, Ngorongoro, and Zanzibar, but that there were many more destinations to consider. The south, for example, remains largely undiscovered. Even the wildlife is rich, diverse, abundant, and easily visible. And then you have culture and places of historical interest. Meanwhile, for people who enjoy trekking, Tanzania is not only about Mt. Kilimanjaro. We have numerous other mountains that offer amazing experiences. Those keen on fishing can take on the ocean, and also visit the three Great Lakes. Meanwhile, medical tourism has potential especially in terms of alternative traditional medicine, as part of our cultural tourism offering. We even have people visiting for volunteer tourism, similar to cultural tourism, but where visitors bring expertise to the local communities.</p><h4>How is the Tourist Board working with the private sector to improve the infrastructure needed to connect these tourist destinations?</h4><p>We are working closely with the private sector both within and beyond Tanzania. We are trying to encourage airlines to fly here. In this regard, Qatar Airways and Turkish Airlines have increased their flights as of 2013. That is a development that TTB and other stakeholders within the aviation industry worked together to realize. Whenever we attend international tourism exhibitions or any sort of platform where we meet airlines, we try to foster their greater participation in Tanzania by lobbying the government for incentives. Reports that we have received from Qatar Airlines and Turkish Airlines reveal that they do not regret their decisions. The number of passengers flying into Kilimanjaro and Dar es Salaam has increased tremendously. We expect other airlines, when they see this potential, to follow suit.</p><h4>Over the next decade, where would you like to see the Tanzanian tourism sector?</h4><p>I would like for it to become the number one sector in the economy by surpassing the target of 2 million visitors, and ultimately even reaching 5 million. I would also like to see Tanzania become the number one destination in Africa, and I think our offering has the weight to achieve this. We may need to improve on service delivery, but with the contribution of the National College of Tourism and other private sector initiatives we are confident of improvement on this front. And regarding infrastructure, the government is doing a sterling job making sure that virtually all of the major cities and towns are connected, while the same can be said for the aviation sector. With these improvements, I expect to see more tourists, both international and domestic.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What factors have contributed to the success of Virgin Megastores here in the Middle East, particularly the UAE, compared to the phasing out in markets like the US or the UK?</h4><p>The fact that the store is more of a license than a franchise has been pivotal because it has allowed us to adapt the concept. We have kept the essence of the positioning of the brand; we have taken care of it in every sense of the word. Our ability to adapt the concept to fit different sensitivities has allowed us to succeed in each of the markets we are in. Our internal culture is also a contributing factor, and it is a culture built around innovation. Doors are always open and ideas are always flowing and they can flow in any direction. The fact that we have this very strong entrepreneurial spirit in the company means people feel very comfortable speaking up and taking initiative; it is what has driven growth and success. I remain the custodian and allow new ideas to be trialed, bring them to light, and invest in the right projects. This gives us a sense of excitement, achievement, and belonging.</p><h4>You spoke of developing the brand. How do you go about that across MENA?</h4><p>We have always been a brand with purpose and believe in doing business for good. Richard Branson embodies that spirit. We try to build on that solid foundation and take the retail entertainment experience to a whole new level. The brand has built its strength creatively, organically, and by directing its attention toward causes that are meaningful. Entrepreneurs know that Virgin is here to provide support. That is the best community marketing that a brand can be associated with.</p><div class="quote">“We have always been a brand with purpose and believe in doing business for good."</div><h4>How important do you think it is to build partnerships with local companies?</h4><p>It is critical to our success. We work with many local brands that understand our brand and offer products and services that appeal to us. As a business operating in the Middle East it is part of our business responsibility to benefit the businesses around us so we all become stronger as a market. We have positioned the Virgin Megastore in a way that can accommodate major brand names as well as smaller start-ups.</p><h4>How do you think the Department for Economic Development's initiative on the Dubai Index of Intellectual Property will impact the retail sector?</h4><p>The Index is there initially to get a baseline understanding read on where we are as far as intellectual property understanding and how much companies exercise or invest in intellectual property protection, making sure all of their trademarks are registered correctly in the right classes and countries. Intellectual property is part of a country's asset. We have qualified law firms that are focused on trademarks and intellectual property and have global experience they can bring to the UAE. There is awareness but as businesses move into new territories like e-commerce it is important that inventors, entrepreneurs, and investors register their name, URL, and all their intellectual property and put aside a budget to protect their ideas.</p><h4>What is your forecast for Dubai's retail sector going forward?</h4><p>Every year we project double-digit growth and we have been beating those targets and I think what applies to us applies to a lot of other retailers that have a strong concept and solid brand positioning. Dubai is a capital of shopping and what is very interesting is seeing the Dubai effect across regional markets in MENA. Everybody is aspiring toward a much higher standard, which makes it much easier for the retailers to operate. We are going in with healthy conditions for brands and for employees. All of that is built on his Highness' vision. There is also an interesting change happening outside of the big malls in the form of community malls with unique brands and offerings and that is a trend that is here to stay. We may need to bring new concepts or formats to these community or neighborhood-type malls.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-greater-process]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>TuranBank updated its strategy for 2012-2015. Can you explain what these updates included?</h4><p>TuranBank has been in Azerbaijan for 22 years and, until 2007, the bank operated as a boutique bank serving a small number of businesses. The bank moved away from corporate clients toward the SME and retail sector by approving a strategy for 2008-2011. Together with the IFC and other institutional investors, we looked at our strengths and weaknesses and decided to further expand our focus and add micro business to our model in our 2012-2015 vision. In Azerbaijan, we have roughly 95,000 legal entities and roughly 500,000 people in Azerbaijan with the tax registry who are involved in entrepreneurship activity. We started piloting a new strategy branch by branch. A group loan product where, for example, five people collectively obtain a loan and pay it back together has been introduced. Also, we are looking into green business for an additional customer base, whereas the bank will be supporting projects that are eco-friendly, as well as those that are thinking of optimizing their operations from an energy and environmental impact prospective. Although Azerbaijan still imports foodstuff, we also export a large amount of foodstuff meaning that there is great capacity that we can take advantage in terms of potential markets for the local producers.</p><h4>What is the balance between your corporate and retail strategy?</h4><p>In 2012, the balance was roughly 52% corporate and 48% SME. Our goal is to be at 75% MSME by the end of 2015. Currently, we are at roughly 70% of our portfolio, because we still have companies that have been with us for 10 years, and we want to keep those relationships. The idea is that by growing, the exposure and number of corporates will be reduced, and we will be in line with our targets by the end of 2015.</p><div class="quote">“Our goal is to be at 75% MSME by the end of 2015."</div><h4>Looking at the European Games, what opportunities do you think there are for the development of the MSMEs, and what role can TuranBank play in that?</h4><p>The most important barrier for every economy is the learning cost associated with the development process. Learning and integrating better standards takes time, especially for SMEs. We work with many companies involved in catering, tourism, and transport, and previously their standards may have been different, but now they are changing, taking into account better practices. It benefits them to learn and understand the advantages. Sometimes our clients are a little skeptical, but eventually they understand that they need to be a part of this greater process. If our customers and our partners work with better standards, it is great for us. It means we speak the same language. Further down the line, it will create additional investment opportunities for everyone. Our stock market is in a rapid development phase, and we need companies to open up. In addition, we expect new revenue streams that will further support their growth. I believe The European Games will greatly assist with all this.</p><h4>What is the benefit of providing such a wide range of loan services?</h4><p>The needs of businesses vary. As a financial intermediary, we have to examine a project and give advice on what type of loan should be granted. TuranBank cooperates with a number of domestic and international financial institutions. Through these partnerships we get preferential loan facilities, which help us access lower-cost and longer-term finance. Local funds and savings are available on average for two-years, except for those that are financed through government funds and agencies. However, in certain areas, such as agriculture projects, five to seven year loans are needed. Even if they do not fall within the scope of local funds, we are able to provide the required financial facility for these businesses so that they can be repaid in time.</p><h4>What opportunities does TuranBank's presence in other regions of Azerbaijan bring?</h4><p>We pride ourselves on our substantial knowledge in terms of regions, as well as agriculture and related processing, even though gaining that experience took some time. In 2014, we opened two new branches, both in regions where there are many SMEs. Our access to finance should benefit the businesses and the regions. The major banks work with the corporates, and we work with MSMEs. We expect three additional branches in the regions in 2015. The one that we opened in September 2014 in Jalilabad is already paying benefits, and we hope to move to the Agcabadi region soon.</p><h4>What is the significance of the partnerships that TuranBank has with international institutions?</h4><p>In recent years, international cooperation has been a huge part of our operations. We cooperate with the International Finance Corporation (IFC), Black Sea Trade and Development Bank (BSTDB), European Bank of Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), Islamic Corporation for the Development of the Private Sector (ICD), the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and many others. The most important part for me is what we learn from these institutions. For example, our employees have been to several regional banks in the US in recent past. They have seen the standards, and how the businesses operate, watching how loans are generated, and how saving products work. We have been part of a lot of technical assistance projects, and it has been helpful in transforming the bank to its current standards. Learning is a major part of our culture, and this cooperation has helped us tremendously.</p><h4>What are the most important steps that need to be taken to ensure that the financial sector continues to develop and mature?</h4><p>The overall banking system is stable as the central bank has a conservative countercyclical position. When it sees the sector booming it tries to cool it down. As a conservative banker, I agree with that. Increasingly, private credit bureaus are a necessity. Currently, we have only one, which is a structure within the Central Bank. We are one of 10 banks in Azerbaijan, together with IFC to create the first private credit bureau in the country, which should be in place by the end of 2015. Corporate governance standards are not compulsory, businesses are moving in that direction at a slower pace, and in order for the banking sector to move forward it should be incentivized. We lower our risk perception as an institution in lending process when we see the standards. Another part of this process is bringing additional capital into the country, which will also bring with it more expertise and transparency. An environment that attracts more companies to invest in Azerbaijan will help the banking sector to grow, as we will be dealing with institutions and companies that operate with better standards. The government is rapidly moving in the direction of an actively used electronic payment environment with approved strategy and banks are seeing results. There has been an increase in the number of ATMs, terminals, and overall non-cash transactions. With the collapse of the Soviet system, people lost their trust in the financial system. However, what the government achieved is impressive in terms of realities of today. Savings have gone up by almost 10% in 2014 in the sector. The government, through its monetary and fiscal mechanisms, has always supported private business. This has been very clear if you analyze how the Azerbaijani economy has transformed in recent years. TuranBank will always try to support this process and play its role as a financial institution.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What distinguishes the Grand Hotel Guayaquil within the tourism sector?<br></h4><p>The Grand Hotel Guayaquil features 182 fully-equipped and renovated rooms, a 24-hour café, a first class restaurant, a bar with live music, as well as the Terraza Racquet Club with two squash courts, a fully-equipped gym, sauna, steam bath, and massage service. The hotel also has a beautiful panoramic swimming pool with a waterfall, located in a tropical environment. The location, in the middle of the regenerated downtown section of the city, is basically in the tourist center of Guayaquil; we share a whole city block with the Cathedral, and are one block away from the park where hundreds of iguanas are admired by locals and visitors daily. Another asset is that our hotel is only four blocks away from the Malecon 2000, a beautiful and safe site for local and international tourism, for promenading along the river, with 1.5 miles of trees and flowers, and a good number of shops and cafés.</p><h4>What is the main profile of your guests?</h4><p>We have a variety of guests, as ours is a full service hotel and one of the three largest in the city; we welcome corporate guests and local and foreign business people, as well as national and international tourists. As the hotel is located in the tourist heart of the city, we have a good volume of weekend family packages, sport events, and tourism groups, mainly from France, Germany, Switzerland, Spain, and the US. We are the best choice for organized tourism packages for groups and a good number of individuals in transit to the Galápagos Islands. As Guayaquil is the country's most active port we are obliged to mention the corporate business, which means a great number of business people and visitors to conventions, congresses, and fairs.</p><h4>What occupancy levels have you seen in 2013, and does seasonality present a challenge?</h4><p>Occupancy has maintained its level of approximately 65% a year since 2012. Being a city hotel, we do not really have a seasonal shift, but we do have lower occupancy in the first four or five months of the year, and our best five months run from July through November.</p><h4>The hotel is currently undergoing renovations. How will these enhance it?</h4><p>This renovation is our fifth since opening in the mid-1970s, but there is a crucial difference this time. In contrast to previous renovations this one is comprehensive, externally and internally, with a total investment of over $3 million. Being in a highly competitive environment, we have decided to proceed with the facade, dividing it into 14 sections, and four floors, remodeling half-floor by half-floor, and all the rooms.</p><h4>What has made the hotel so successful over the past 37 years?</h4><p>Our 37 years in this market are not a coincidence. The constant training of our staff, our genuine orientation towards the comfort of our guests and clients, and remaining the best and most innovative, in terms of decor, service and technology initiatives; this has been helpful in terms of providing the best possible services to our guests.</p><h4>What does Guayaquil have on offer to attract MICE tourism?</h4><p>Guayaquil is located at sea level, with an international airport that operates 365 days a year. The city features a good number of deluxe hotels belonging to known chains, plus new openings announced for the next five years. With a population of 2.2 million, Guayaquil is the economic capital of Ecuador and the preferred venue for important national and international events. There is a new convention and visitor bureau, which will be charged with promoting the city to the country and the wider world. The city boasts a convention center with a capacity of 3,000 seats, and the principal hotels also have large convention facilities. Guayaquil has been selected to host the International Aviculture Congress 2015, and the Orchid World Congress 2017, each with between 1,500 and 3,000 participants.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did you come by your vocation?<br></h4><p>My father, Ernestro Ribadeneira, was the founder of the El Recreo neighborhood in Quito, which was purpose-built for the workers of the La Internacional textile factory located in what today is Centro Comercial El Recreo. His idealism and social conscience inspires me to this day, and was the reason that, 25 years ago when I was a Vice-President of a bank, we created Su Cambio por El Cambio (Your Change for Change). This scheme involved the collection of spare change at a network of supermarkets, which was then channeled to the construction of homes for street children. In just three years, 2,000 street children received housing, while we also spread the message of the need for a positive upbringing that would inspire children to grow up as responsible adults.</p><h4>What did you do in that respect?</h4><p>In 1995, pursuing a closely held ambition of mine, I created Banco Solidario, the first Ecuadorean bank with a social mission to provide access to credit for self-employed parents and small businesses excluded from the conventional banking system. I was motivated by helping people escape the trap of debt and fostering the growth of small businesses that wanted to succeed but were excluded from regular means of funding.</p><h4>How can financial inclusion generate benefits that improve people's economic situation?</h4><p>A credit line of $1,000 from the informal sector would accrue $1,500 of interest per year. By relying on us instead, the client would only have to pay $260 in interest. The balance of $1,240 remains in the hands of those who worked hard to generate it.</p><h4>How was Banco Solidario developed?</h4><p>From 1995 to 2006, we issued microcredits worth over $1 billion to 350,000 families and delivered 5,000 social homes with Bono de la Vivienda (the housing bonds program). Furthermore, we paved the way for microfinance in Ecuador. After us came Credife, Procredit, Bancos del Barrio, and many other cooperative banks. Nevertheless, we came to realize that certain ingrained paradigms within the industry had become obsolete and needed to be rethought in the interest of the segment.</p><h4>Who is being excluded from the current system?</h4><p>Anyone not enrolled in the Social Security System is excluded, as the Bank of the Ecuadorean Institute of Social Security (BIESS) does not serve these individuals. Additionally, the unbanked population, representing 60% of the economically active population (EAP), lack instrumental information regarding financial information on matters such as assets or guarantees. They are often self-employed or small business owners who, because they are unbanked, fall prey to unscrupulous lenders; eroding what little savings they may have during times of personal crisis.</p><h4>How can financial inclusion be made more comprehensive?</h4><p>This requires a systematic effort toward rejecting accepted systems of banking. The organizations that have, thus far, served this segment have become cumbersome, and by extension, obliged to meet higher operational costs prompting many of them to withdraw from this less profitable branch of banking. Many sound lessons can be drawn from experiences abroad. In Asia, microloans are extended by cell phone and e-money has become massive in Kenya, greatly extending financial inclusion. In Venezuela, with the arrival of Chávez, a specialist microfinance bank became the loan originator for banks lacking experience in the microcredit business. The Chávez administration required that 3.5% of their portfolio be reserved for micro-enterprises. The model for the future in terms of financial inclusion must amalgamate existing concepts for the sustainable performance of this financial service.</p><h4>Then what did you do to create a model that brought together these ideas and broke paradigms?</h4><p>We looked for a small financial entity, so that through it we could integrate these concepts and follow our vision of going further than just microfinancing. This meant that small business owners and their families would find in one place everything they need to improve their quality of life: microcredit, emergency credit, supplies for work, supplies for home, health insurance, medical assistance, hospitalization, and even “homes with the own little houses."</p><h4>And did you find it?</h4><p>When you follow your dreams and learn to listen to the voice of your heart, your visions materialize. We found that with PROINCO, which was the most well-recognized real estate brand in the country. Hence, with PROINCO already operating, we decided to add YAPA, a word that inspired us because of its meaning “to give more," and which helped us to renew our philosophy in our new financial inclusion project. For us, giving a little bit more makes us happy.</p><h4>What does PROINCO do?</h4><p>PROINCO is a financial entity specializing in financial inclusion. With just 27 staff, we disburse $12 million in microcredit per month, leveraging the YAPA's existing commercial network nationwide, as well as in partner institutions and other non-bank outlets. The client portfolio generated is then sold on to financial entities that lack our know-how and experience. To access credit, our unbanked clients can conveniently utilize an existing banking network to pay their YAPA fees. And now that electronic money is gaining ground, we will be issuing credit and receiving payment via cell phones, eliminating the need to even have a bank account.</p><h4>What prospective markets could you expand into going forward?</h4><p>We will offer the world's first example of a system that generates products that are an alternative to social security for those not covered. This is the culmination of many years of planning based on a vision of inclusion set out by my father. To achieve this, we have formed an alliance with a financial entity from the Popular and Solidarity Economy.</p><h4>How will you achieve this?</h4><p>Clients who are not affiliates of the IESS will invest in a certificate of contribution, becoming a member of the financial entity of the Popular and Solidarity Economy. The profit from this certificate will create a reserve fund for the retirement of small business owners. Also, being a member of the entity will give rights to health insurance, medical assistance, and hospitalization with microcredit for their business, credit for home and business supplies, and mortgage credit so that they can build what my father used to refer to as a “home in their own little house." In this manner, we continue his legacy.</p><h4>Does your motivation come from your father's sense of social justice?</h4><p>PROINCO Inmobiliaria is continuing on the same path. He founded El Recreo, and we have founded Nuevo Sur, which will become the neighborhood boasting the best services and housing in the south of Quito. There is a commercial center planned, as well as a theater, schools, and even a dry port with storage for heavy trucks, sparing merchants the long journey to Quito. All this was designed by considering improvements to the overall quality of life of local families. Meanwhile, a separate project of this type in the parish of Cutuglahua, in Mejí­a Canton—the new development center of Quito—has received foreign investment.</p><h4>Does PROINCO Inmobiliaria also realize other types of development?</h4><p>Our sole mission is to improve the quality of life of the communities that receive our real estate investments. We are developing the best project on the Ecuadorean coast in Jama, Punta Ballena. By combining the efforts of the public and private sectors, we are improving social conditions in El Matal, in order to transform it into a prime tourist attraction, which is in line with the government's goal of redeveloping our beaches and towns. It will be known as Mundo Jama, and will prove the point that merely planning a socially worthwhile scheme is the first bold step toward realizing it in reality.</p><h4>Everything you have said could be summarized with the message: giving a little more makes us happy. Would you agree?</h4><p>Yes. This is our philosophy, and I hope God will give us the light and life to continue enjoying it, and that we can achieve all that we have proposed and that we can leave our children with a mission and a task to fulfill.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[cementing-the-future]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance of having a national cement company?<br></h4><p>The cement business is a monopolistic business by nature. This is typically because there are very few producers for a lot of consumers. In Ecuador, we have four plants and three companies for 15 million consumers. Locally, there was a lack of cement from 20 years ago up until 2012. In 2007, the government started to improve things, such as infrastructure, roads, health, and education. To achieve these goals, we needed cement as one of the main building materials, and up until 2012 the government asked us to increase production because the private producers could not supply the market. In most countries, except Ecuador and Paraguay, the entire market belongs to the private sector. In this case, we have two main private producers, which are also the two biggest producers in the world. One is Holcim, which is Swiss, and the other is Lafarge, from France. Now, these two companies have merged and have more or less an 80% market share. We made many investments, especially in recent years, and increased our production three fold. We needed a public cement company, but now the supply has met the market demand and we can leave this business to private producers.</p><h4>What is the significance of the restructuring within the public cement sector?</h4><p>The government has two companies. One of them is Cemento Chimborazo, and the other is Industrias Guapan. Previously, they were owned by different parts of the government, but we have now merged them together into the Unión Cementera Nacional UCEM Compañí­a de Economia Mixta, where 95% of shares belong to Empresa Publica Cementera del Ecuador (EPCE). This was because Cemento Chimborazo had a 5% market share and Guapan had a 7% market share; therefore, we decided to bring them together to make the company stronger. We performed this merger in November 2013, and right now we are looking to make this company stronger with an investment of around $230 million to put in a brand new clinker line. Clinker is one of the steps in making cement. The cement is produced from limestone and clay. From limestone and clay, we produce clinker, and with clinker and the addition of gypsum we produce cement. Therefore, we need a kiln and a lot of equipment, such as a crusher. Right now, the country imports a lot of clinker, close to 1 million tons per year; however, the government is working to reduce imports, which is why we need to increase domestic clinker production. To do that we have to invest huge amounts of money, and the government has decided to transfer the responsibility to the private sector.</p><h4>Would you say the cement industry can play an important role in the transformation of the productive matrix?</h4><p>Definitely, because it is a strong industry. The cement industry is a nice one because we start with geological materials, with mine quarries, and limestone, and then we have to transform this material, meaning we need the mechanical-electrical industry. We also have to transform materials with heat, making it a chemical industry. Then, we have to sell the product, meaning it is a market industry. We also need electronics and software. The cement industry uses combustible fuels, meaning we have to move away from the use of fossil fuel or oil to other products. In Europe, for example, they can substitute 50% of these combustibles, such as coal, oil, and gas, by using waste, such as plastics and tires. In Ecuador, the use of such fuels is now zero, meaning we can use the cement industry to initiate this change. The cement industry could be, in a few years, the friend of humanity because we can utilize all of the waste, instead of burning it. We can reach two goals simultaneously by helping the environment while using this material to produce cement.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of Ecuador for Novartis?<br></h4><p>Ecuador is an interesting market for Novartis. Latin American markets have factors that are different in comparison to the US and European markets. In Ecuador, there are 16 million people and we provide them with the most innovative treatments. Novartis puts a lot of effort into having the same portfolio in Ecuador a in Europe and the US. Besides pharmaceuticals, Novartis Ecuador has over-the-counter (OTC), generics, animal health, Alcon, and ophthalmology.</p><h4>What would you say is driving growth in the Ecuadorean market?</h4><p>For Novartis, it is different in each business line. Through the primary care business, we pursue detailed promotional activities to reach key opinion leaders and primary care physicians to promote our solutions for hypertension, metabolism, respiratory, pain, and central-nervous system issues. We have a great opportunity in the primary care business since it has been, and will continue to be, the main driver of our growth. We work with physicians and many important distributors in the country. For Novartis, it is really important to continue developing specialty businesses. We have held many launches here, and all of these products have scientific agents behind them.</p><h4>What is the split of your business between the public and private sectors?</h4><p>The private market continues to be very important, consisting of almost 75% of our operations. The public market is increasing day-by-day and is reaching 25%. More than 60% or 70% of the Ecuadorean population has some type of healthcare coverage, while 30% of people are below the poverty line. We are trying to grow in both segments of the business. The public business should be a higher percentage than it is today. The public sector may be proportionally bigger in other countries, but both markets are very important for us.</p><h4>Do you see the potential for Ecuador to become a major exporter of pharmaceuticals?</h4><p>The government will need to put more effort into changing the productive matrix. In order to do this, Ecuador should guarantee investments both locally and externally. For example, IP protection must be improved. We talk about compulsory licenses, but in terms of the cost of maintaining patents, Ecuador is one of the highest in the world. Additionally, the time it takes to approve a patent in Ecuador is considerable. In the past five or six years we have only had a couple of examples, so we need long-term, clear rules. The government could provide clearer signals to the pharmaceutical business in this area. Right now it is difficult, as we have seen with the EU agreement. Possibly the most critical issue that postponed the agreement has been IP regulations. We may need to qualify the long-term strategy from the government authorities to try to become more attractive as a market.</p><h4>What kind of challenges does Ecuador present for the pharmaceutical industry?</h4><p>Ecuador has challenges similar to those you may find in any other growing and emerging markets. In the Latin American and Asian markets, because we have weak IP protection, there are low levels of reimbursement. The government offers limited budgets, and many local pharmaceutical companies produce copies and brand generics that hurt the market more so than in European or US markets.</p><h4>Should IP be a concern in issues of public health?</h4><p>We really want to have a dialogue with the government and Minister of Health on this matter with a long-term perspective. We have been working to establish a link to the patient so that treatment costs are part of this dialogue. The patient is at the center of our decisions. Ecuador deserves innovative treatments just like other countries. We are not adapting our portfolio for this situation; on the contrary, we are working hard to establish a strong portfolio here.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the global significance of Ecuador to Grunenthal?<br></h4><p>Ecuador holds a special position for Grunenthal. Not only from a production perspective, since one of the five plants that Grunenthal has in is the world is located here, but also due to the fact that Grunenthal Ecuador was the first subsidiary opened in Latin America. Last year we celebrated 40 years of operations in the country. This was of great significance for the group. Currently we are involved in an ambitious project to grow within the Latin American region. Ecuador, being one of the largest subsidiaries of the group, occupies an important role within that project. We provide pharmaceuticals from Ecuador to all the countries in which we operate, from Mexico to Chile. The Ecuador plant produces for all of Latin America.</p><h4>Would you say that having a plant here distinguishes Grunenthal from the other pharmaceutical companies in the country?</h4><p>Definitely, because I believe that it allows us the flexibility to produce. We also generate work. The plant allows our group to introduce new products with more flexibility and a reduction in the time to market, compared to other companies in the country.</p><h4>How does the pharmaceutical sector here compare to that of Panama?</h4><p>They are different situations. Panama has limited local manufacturing, as opposed to Ecuador where we have multiple manufacturers. That is the reason why the government is insisting on raising the quality of the products. Government policies are different in each country, too.</p><h4>What is your view of the role that pharmaceutical companies can and should play in supporting public health?</h4><p>As companies dedicated to research, it is important that we make new technology available to the population and that we educate people in the use of that technology. It is also important that we continue working to reduce the time it takes for these products to reach the market so that they can make a difference in people's lives as soon as possible. That is where we can best contribute; international companies have the best up-to-date practices related to drug safety and compliance, which regulate these internal practices and could be shared with local companies, thus improving the quality of their practices. We are talking about health and business. This is a very fine line, which must be widened so we can be more compliant. The industry has been negatively labeled at times, so I think it is important for our industry to work within these guidelines in order to protect the population.</p><h4>What is Grunenthal's vision for the sector?</h4><p>Grunenthal's vision is to be focused on the patient. We want to be the player that is close to the physicians and making available new technologies, as well as transferring information regarding the treatment of pathologies. Grunenthal mainly focuses on the treatment of pain and women's health pathologies. We strive to become stronger partners for physicians, institutions, and patients in those areas.</p><h4>Grunenthal recently acquired the Chilean pharmaceutical company Laboratorios Andrómaco. What is the importance of that acquisition for Grunenthal's regional operations?</h4><p>This acquisition will help to improve the availability of new products that we can promote and bring to patients. It is also an opportunity to grow not only in a business sense, but also to grow with our collaborators. We are bringing new ideas, and this is important for the company. Another objective is to make sure it continues to be a great place to work. This is related to having the capacity to attract and retain talent. You have to have people who are proud of being part of the Grunenthal group. Of course, we also want to consolidate our position as a main partner of our physicians and clients.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have ESPOL graduates contributed to development in Ecuador?<br></h4><p>ESPOL was founded 56 years ago. During this time, one of our main goals has been to offer high-quality undergraduate education. I would argue that our undergraduates become the best-qualified professionals in Ecuador. Being a technical university, our primary contribution is to the industrial sector, the private sector—engineering areas such as electrical, mechanical, civil, petroleum, and, computer science, geology, and marine biology, among others. We work in applied research to generate knowledge for developing the agricultural sector. Our marine research lab CENAIM developed most of the techniques used to prevent white spot disease. We are also working on biotechnology for bananas growers to organically combat certain agricultural diseases. Our curriculum is designed to develop leaders and entrepreneurs, rather than only engineers.</p><h4>What role do you see for technical education in Ecuador in the efforts to transform the productive matrix?</h4><p>This transformation requires well-trained people. For example, the Refineria del Pací­fico project requires 2,000 engineers skilled in petrochemicals, automatic control, electricity, mechanics, chemistry, and so on. The country lacks these human resources, and the university's role is to bridge this gap, which is difficult because training in any of these fields requires at least five years. The other option is to retrain professionals from other areas, for example training a mechanical engineer for the petrochemical sector. To transform the productive matrix we need well-qualified researchers in order to generate knowledge for innovation. Research plus development leads to innovation and to changes in the productive system, and research and development should be done at universities and through innovation by the private sector.</p><h4>Do you see relationships with the private sector as a bigger part of how the university will respond to future national requirements?</h4><p>In the oil and gas sector, most companies are state-owned enterprises—PetroEcuador and PetroAmazonas, for example. These entities are destined to have an important role in the productive matrix and need well-trained people. You either bring these people in from abroad or you train them here, and this is where ESPOL plays an important role.</p><h4>What is the importance of international links for ESPOL?</h4><p>This is essential in both undergraduate and graduate education. We are the only university in Ecuador with international accreditation: two engineering programs accredited by ABET and our business school accredited by AACSB. We are going to start two PhD programs. A key component of these will be a six-month stint abroad at a research lab. We encourage our professors to author papers with professors from other universities and to write research proposals. Our professors work with colleagues from America and Europe on different research projects.</p><h4>What is your vision for ESPOL and its relationship with the government, the productive matrix, and private sector?</h4><p>Until 10 years ago all universities in this country, including ESPOL, were teaching oriented, where the main goal was undergraduate education. We are today going from an educational to a research-oriented institution. This means that while we formerly hired professors for teaching positions, today we hire professors for research and teaching. We are now incentivizing professors to publish in international, high-impact publications. We also encourage people to seek research funding. Our key point is that all effort must ultimately be aligned with the productive matrix. ESPOL is developing an Innovation Zone for Ecuadorian Littoral (Zona de Innovación del Litoral Ecuatoriano [ZILE]) as a mechanism to work on applied research and development for innovation; because the coastal area needs a technical, economic, and social development engine.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Universidad de Cuenca is over 145 years old. How has the institution's significance for Ecuador changed over that time?<br></h4><p>The University of Cuenca is the second oldest in the country after the Universidad Central del Ecuador. It has had a clear impact on both the city and the country at large. Many Ecuadorean politicians have previously served as professors at the university, or were educated here, and in that context our institution has a long and well-established tradition. The new higher educational law will present a challenge for us, having been created to transform the universities' teaching institutions more into centers of research. Indeed research is one of the activities that our universities have yet to fully embrace.</p><h4>What are the challenges involved in effecting this transition?</h4><p>The main problem is the need for skilled individuals who are keen to conduct research. The teachers are not prepared to undertake research as they lack experience in this area. At present, we have many students who are set to obtain their PhDs overseas—in the US, Spain, Belgium, or Germany—so it is simply a matter of time before they return having developed this expertise themselves. The current government wants to implement these changes rapidly, but this cannot be done to order. We agree on the need to advance ourselves to become a more comprehensive university. We have to teach, but also have to conduct research. For that we need to prepare people, as well as install infrastructure such as laboratories. This is the easier part of the equation that simply requires financial outlay. The challenge lies in adequately training human capital.</p><h4>What role do inter-university connections play in building research capacity?</h4><p>We need to develop a research network beyond the national network of research in the principal universities of the country. However, we also need connections with other countries because Ecuador is a relatively small nation. We have connections with Belgium, Germany, Spain, the US, and other countries, where we are trying to link our own institutions with the best universities we can find.</p><h4>How would you characterize the University's relationship with the city of Cuenca?</h4><p>We say that the city belongs to the university and the university to the city. This is the only public university in the area, and I consider its contribution important for personal development. We have agreements with all municipalities, and numerous mayors of the city belong to the university. The city's mayor was a professor at the university, so there is a close relationship with the government, and also with the people. We have given assistance to small towns to help them obtain water, for instance, and are running such studies at this university.</p><h4>What is your medium-term vision for the university?</h4><p>It will remain a quality university that helps to solve the problems faced by the country, that educates the people of this region, and that cooperates to help develop the city and its surrounding region. We will try to take good care of the country's natural environment. We are heavily active in this area and our students know that it is important to have this clear objective. I see the future of this in research.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Moore Stephens has a wide international presence. What is the significance of Ecuador for the group as an international consultancy firm?<br></h4><p>Moore Stephens was founded in London in 1906, and now it has a presence in over 105 countries worldwide, one of which is Ecuador. Ecuador is one of our most important markets in the Latin American region. We started not as an auditing firm but as a consulting firm, and, thus, we had numerous multinational clients that required services in other countries. Ecuador has been an important reference to other firms in the region and worldwide.</p><h4>What is the main focus of your practice in Ecuador today?</h4><p>We used to work on huge legal studies with partners from Deloitte, Arthur Anderson, PwC, and so on. But we did not want to be just a law firm or an audit firm. We preferred to become a more strategic consulting firm that provides a comprehensive service. In that regard, we use all of this knowledge as a tool to provide strategic business consulting without dividing into practice areas.</p><h4>Many of your clients switch to you from one of the big four consulting firms. Why is that?</h4><p>Many companies or clients we work with have normally worked with the big four. But, in Ecuador, they choose to work with us because we create value for them. We provide a difference in our services. We offer considerable personalization, and offer important creative and strategic products that meet customer needs. We are always working within the concept of a factory. We do not produce cars, but we do produce ideas. Ecuador has extensively reformed its constitution and laws. It is not only a matter of understanding the new legal requirements and obligations the companies have to meet, but also how to help them take advantage of those reforms to be more competitive.</p><h4>What would you say, then, is your value proposition in Ecuador?</h4><p>We want to be the iPod of consulting. We want to make a difference and I think we are doing that because we have the trust of multinational and national clients. All of the products we create are designed with a focus on creating value or trying to go one step ahead. We want to create products that perceive what the needs and obligations are, and help clients understand their legal requirements.</p><h4>What kind of services could an international company looking to enter the Ecuadorean market expect to receive from Moore Stephens?</h4><p>At the beginning, we will send along all the information about doing business so a firm has an overview of legislation in Ecuador. We can then work on the legal establishment of the company or branch, and will advise on the better options. We can also help with the accounting of the company, or even with its representation if the client so wishes. We can help with tax matters and financial issues if a firm needs capital or loans for projects. We can also assist with hiring personnel and headhunting, as well as strategic issues specific to the business you want to implement.</p><h4>What are the major challenges you see for foreign investors coming into Ecuador?</h4><p>We have had a lot of reforms, and we have to be aware that Ecuador's is a revolutionary government with a “21st Century socialism" oriented mindset. We also have to understand what its goals are. All of the laws it is issuing have an eye on instituting its overall goals, so it is important that companies understand the new regulations. They have to improve their processes in accordance with those regulations, and they have to see the opportunities that are available.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-favorite-tuna]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Would you say that Marbelize has played an important role in the economic development of Manabí­ province?<br></h4><p>Yes, certainly. We are the biggest exporter on the catering side of tuna pouch bags in Ecuador. The tuna pouch bags are our main business. In 2001, we started bringing the latest technology into the plants. We contribute notably to the economy by directly hiring 1,125 people from Manta, and working with 3,000 indirect workers, and many vessels. In 2008, we also started a company for the mechanical and electronic parts of our operations.</p><h4>What distinguishes Marbelize in Ecuador's tuna sector?</h4><p>Marbelize is the fourth largest exporter of tuna in Ecuador. We are also the first to develop new kinds of products. We are innovative; we invest in research to develop new products and create new trends. We were the first company to have tuna in a glass container in Ecuador. Afterwards, the competition followed, and now you have a mixture of seafood in glass jars. We introduced that in 2004, and also export glass jars now. There are two big companies with more than 50 years of experience in the market that focus on cans. To compete against them is impossible, and so we pursue other targets and alternative products. We are going to change the way people eat tuna, for example by flavoring it, and packaging it in glass jars, and we also have Cazuela Manabita (Manabí­ Casserole). We are developing other products such as tuna nuggets, hamburgers, and meatballs. We also have green olives filled with tuna and then fried. That is a new market in frozen products. You can find these products in the supermarket, but we also deal directly with cafeterias in schools. We work with 900 different brands from all over the world. It is not just my own brand. In the German market, we have a client that wants our tuna meatballs with a different sauce. They are willing to pay for it because they are confident of its quality. We also sell glass jars to Australia. We even make a special product for cruise ships.</p><h4>What portion of your sales is domestic?</h4><p>It is not even 2%. We are increasing it considerably, but we don't have the volume here in Ecuador. Most people in Ecuador prefer canned tuna, but that is a small part of our business. We are going with the niche products on one side. Meanwhile, I am developing products for the military, and caterers that supply meals to government schools.</p><h4>Given the importance of exports, how closely do you work with the Ministry of Foreign Trade to open new markets for Ecuador?</h4><p>I visited Russia with the President, and also to Chile and Dubai. We work a lot with the government in this area. We have to decrease duties, because with 40% in some countries, 50%, or even 80% in others, exports are hindered. Today, we are developing a strong market here and in South America. Although we don't sell to Venezuela, we do sell a lot to Brazil and Chile. Argentina is opening up again. Asia is starting to work a lot with South America, and that creates export difficulties. However, as soon as people sample our quality, they stay with us.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What growth has Laboratorios LIFE experienced over 2013?</h4><p>Last year was an important one because, in addition to the private sector, we have become a key Ecuadorean supplier of products to the public market. Over the past seven years, the government has invested in improving national health conditions. That means that more pharmaceutical products are needed for patients, and the volume has significantly increased accordingly. We thoroughly understand the government's requirements and, accordingly, know precisely what investment and technology is required to meet those needs. Close to 27% of our business is in the public sector.</p><h4>How do your strategies differ when approaching the private and public sectors?</h4><p>They are completely different strategies. In the private market we have the products, we know the doctors and hospitals, and we understand the requirements of specific therapeutic areas and develop our strategies accordingly to supply that market. In the public sector, what is important is to cover the basic needs of the majority of the population through the National Basic Product List, needs that differ entirely from those of the private sector. The most important customers in the public sector are the Ecuadorian Social Insurance System, the Ministry of Health, the Armed Forces, and so on.</p><h4>What notable investments have you committed to?</h4><p>This year, for example, we have invested close to $10 million, and are set to have completed several projects by the end of September 2014. The three most important projects, which make up the majority of that amount, include one new complete line of injectable lyophilized products. The area where we manufacture injectable products has been completely redesigned and rebuilt. We are also expanding the manufacturing capacity of large volume parenteral. Those are the main investments on the technical side. Another important investment is new Enterprise Resource Planning software (ERP). This new system performs the planning and management of the entire company. In addition to that, we are going to implement a new Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and Business Intelligence System, so we will not only be upgrading our internal capacity to manage the business, but also boosting all other systems to better understand the market and its requirements. This will also help us to analyze what strategies we need to implement to remain competitive and increase our market share.</p><h4>What are your main goals for the next couple of years?</h4><p>We are interested in certain therapeutic areas. Ecuador has an increasing need for specialized products in the cardiology, biotechnology, and oncology areas. We develop formulations of our products here in Ecuador. That means we need not only information of what the active principles are that we need for a product, but also on what the right formulation is in order to make it equivalent to original foreign products.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does Universidad Técnica Particular de Loja (UTPL) play in Ecuador's education system?<br></h4><p>The main role has been to democratize teaching through distance education. Our university has been a pioneer in distance education in Latin America for more than 30 years. We began providing distance education in 1976 with the aim of training teachers, as in those days many of them did not hold a university degree or a higher qualification.</p><h4>How has UTPL's focus on distance education transformed the education system in Ecuador?</h4><p>Actually the UTPL boasts more than 26,000 students, many of whom have studied through its distance education program. Our focus has been on providing education for people who live in rural areas, for instance, where it is difficult to access higher education facilities. This has meant that many Ecuadoreans have been able to obtain a degree while doing their normal job. As a result, this has enabled many students to progress in their professional careers. We have also contributed to improving the lives of a vast number of Ecuadorean migrants, especially those who moved abroad for economic reasons. Many of these migrants have been able to complete their studies with us via our distance education courses. This has changed the way many employers view Ecuadorean migrants abroad. We have also received international recognition from international accrediting bodies for our work in this area.</p><h4>How has UTPL contributed to local development in Loja?</h4><p>Since it was originally founded, UTPL has played an important role in developing the local economy. An essential part of the university's mission is to provide outreach to society. In this regard, we have a number of university-led projects that aim to develop the local economy. Essentially, the aim is to provide work experience for our students who take undergraduate programs in related fields such as business administration, hospitality management, and so on. In this sense, we have made a significant impact on local development. It is largely thanks to these initiatives that Loja now has hotels and restaurants of an international standard. There is also UTPL's Technology Valley, which serves as a hub for business incubators and business start-ups for the southern region of Ecuador.</p><h4>Are there more challenges for entrepreneurs in Ecuador who are not based in or near Quito and Guayaquil?</h4><p>There are certainly more challenges for local entrepreneurs, and those challenges are more complicated. One of the major challenges is the lack of formality within the local economy. In Zamora province, for example, a significant proportion of the economy is focused on artisanal or small-scale mining. In the most recent census, it was calculated that there were 91,000 inhabitants in that particular province. Interestingly, the number of people actually registered with the tax authorities as having formal jobs was only 159, and they all came from the public sector. Notwithstanding, there are major mining companies now moving into this field, all seeking a stake in the market. As a university, we are working hard on providing training for both professionals and workers in this field so that they can become more actively involved in the decision making process.</p><h4>Would you say there has been a change in the international perception of higher education in Ecuador?</h4><p>Yes, because the Ecuadorean government is making a major effort to transform our higher education system, specifically through the use of scholarships that promote international mobility programs for students and professors. Unfortunately, there are some key aspects that still require improvement. Arguably Ecuador has had limited opportunities for doctoral level studies compared with other counties in the region, which has made it much harder for the younger generation of professors to obtain their PhDs here in Ecuador, and to have those doctorates recognized internationally.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize the level of success Ecuador has had in protecting its biodiversity?<br></h4><p>I would like to put your question in context: Ecuador has the highest biodiversity per square kilometer in the world. More than 20% of Ecuador's territory has been declared a protected area. The Galápagos National Park is a world example of good environmental management. But some hot spots of biodiversity are in great danger because of oil and copper extraction. An example is the Yasuni National Park, the most biodiverse place in the Western hemisphere.</p><h4>As the former head of the Yasuni-ITT Initiative, how do you feel about the final outcome of the project?</h4><p>I feel disappointed both with the international community and with the Ecuadorean government. The idea was to avoid oil exploitation in the Yasuni National Park, keeping 20% of Ecuador's oil reserves under the soil forever and asking the world community to contribute to half the value of that oil. Ecuador committed to invest those resources in conservation, reforestation, renewable energy production, and support for the poorest communities. After 18 months as head of the Yasuni Initiative, I managed to receive the support of six European countries with a commitment to contribute during 13 years a total amount of $1.76 billion. Unfortunately, large countries such as the US and China showed no interest. When the negotiation was ripe, the Ecuadorean government proposed conditions on the donors that were not attractive, and the project fell apart. Having said that, I must say that I feel proud of the Ecuadoreans who collected 750,000 signatures demanding that a public consultation should be held asking the people whether oil should be exploited in the national park. The authorities bent the law to avoid public consultation.</p><h4>How important is the environment for Metropolitan Touring?</h4><p>We live from this incredible environment. We give the highest level of support to any kind of regulation that is established in the places where we work. Where such regulations do not exist, we promote them ourselves. A good example of that is what we do in Mashpi and in the Galápagos. Our hotel in the Galápagos has received the Travel Award for the third year in a row, as the green lodge of South America. In Mashpi, we are investing not only in the protection of the forest, but also in research. We are developing a project to reintroduce a species of monkey that had disappeared in that area. There were only 250 of them in Ecuador previously. We have constructed a 3.6 MW photovoltaic plant in the same area.</p><h4>Up until now, Ecuador's tourism sector has focused on the Galápagos. Do you see the future of tourism developing in Ecuador as tourism on the mainland?</h4><p>Ecuador has great potential. We must be careful to avoid the type of large-scale, cheap tourism that does not bring progress into the country. I would prefer a tourism portfolio of small facilities where the people, not the large companies, are the owners. That is consistent with the philosophy of the government, with which I agree. Ecuador has the characteristics of small ecosystems and ecodestinations that are completely different from each other. This means that each town's people can develop small facilities, such as hotels or tourist services that can be managed by them. The good thing in tourism is that you need a relatively low amount of capital and training to offer good service. For example, in Mashpi, almost 70% of our employees in our 22-room lodge come from the region. They are learning English, and becoming first-class guides for watching the 450 species of birds. In just a year and a half, they have become experts in tourism, while before they were farmers. That is the value of tourism if you do it in the right way. I hope that the model of tourism we develop in Ecuador will use these small niches wisely, where you will feel the difference between one place and another.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In many countries, the rail sector is considered industrial. However, in Ecuador, it is seen as touristic. Why is that?<br></h4><p>Ecuador used to have a railway network of around 1,000 kilometers built at the end of the 19th century, operating until the mid-20th century, and eventually becoming obsolete. The network had been built according to the prevailing geographic and economic conditions of the time, meaning that it did not comply with today's regulations regarding slopes and curvature. Today, Ecuador's railway network is much more functional, and works through a modern system of tunnels and bridges. The railway has been reintroduced by the current government, and we have taken important steps over the past few years such as the recovery of the touristic train, a rehabilitated line of nearly 500 kilometers in length. Moreover, the government aims to revive railway transportation so as to contribute to the transformation of the production matrix, which is not exclusively industrial. We have sought international expertise on these projects as part of broader infrastructural commitments.</p><h4>How does the Ministry work to bring railway expertise back to the country?</h4><p>We have sought international advice from countries like Spain, where Renfe handles over 15,000 kilometers of railway. We have also prioritized the development of the rail lines we have built, so we know how they work. All in all, we prioritize the development of an Ecuadorean knowledge base, and we have also sent staff to some European countries. I think it is important to have international partnerships for infrastructure construction projects. Today, we have as many as five private Ecuadorean companies laying railway lines and five others engaged in other aspects of railway infrastructure and logistics. These companies also take part in other railway projects in neighboring countries like Peru and Colombia.</p><h4>What is the impact of the more than $350 million in investment plan implemented by the Ministry to local communities?</h4><p>The Ministry started operating railway tracks in 2008, and back then we had just 16,000 tourists a year. In 2013 the figure reached 150,000 tourists. This growth has been possible due to several projects implemented by the Ministry; for example, the excursion train, which is a one-day journey through several regions of our country. We also implemented the so-called Tren Crucero, where tourists can spend some nights on a scenic journey. We have also implemented subsidy plans for certain communities in the country, such as for scholars and the disabled. Today, 75% of our railway tourists are locals, demonstrating the importance of this means of transport for our people. Our main goal in the near future is to boost the Tren Crucero, where 60% of the passengers are foreigners, and increase the overall number of visitors using the Ecuadorean railway network. We have already spent $10 million on promotional campaigns in the US and Europe. These tourism activities bring development and economic alternatives to many rural communities in our country. Our main priorities in this regard are: 1) to bring economic dynamism to the communities through which the train travels, 2) to restore the cultural heritage associated with railways, 3) to operate one of the most beautiful railway lines in the world. We also have plans to supplement the above-mentioned activities with other initiatives such as the Museum of the Train, the Coffee Train, and many more. The communities on the train lines are the ones in charge of managing them, so we will increase their level of participation, generating job opportunities with as many as 5,200 direct employment positions and around 16,000 indirect ones, and providing economic alternatives to these communities.</p><h4>The Tren Crucero we talked about has been nominated for the World Travel Awards. Why should it win?</h4><p>This touristic product was launched in mid-2013 and by the end of the year we were awarded the prize of Best Touristic Product Outside Europe. This in itself is one of the main reasons why we are a real competitor for the World Travel Award; the award is based around the educational and economic impact of the project, the social responsibility aspects of the initiative, and its touristic potential.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-results-oriented-process]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>For more than 20 years Raimbek Group has been one of the leading holdings here in Kazakhstan. What are your recent milestones and highlights?</h4><p>The company has been in the market for more than 23 years, and is one of the few companies that started in the 1990s and is still here today. This stability and longevity is one of our key achievements. Naturally, having been around for more than 20 years, we have reached a period of sustainable growth. A decade ago, Raimbek Group was heading in more than 10 directions, and now we are focused on only three areas of operation. We have gone through rapid growth, as well as post-crisis growth, which describes our current growth. At the moment we are focusing on food, agro, and retail. We have an understanding of these sectors. This is conscious, stable, and pragmatic growth.</p><h4>The activity of the Group's subsidiaries—Raimbek Bottlers, Food Trade House, and Raimbek Agro (dairy products)—make Raimbek Group an active player in Kazakhstan's FMCG segment. How do you compete with international holdings that are also consolidating their presence in the country?</h4><p>The market here is very competitive. The fact is that we have held a leading position for 15 years along with Coca-Cola and PepsiCo. We have been focusing on the resource base, and also believe that vertically integrated holdings are not the right way to go. Instead, we focus on what we know, and create infrastructure around our line of work. Raimbek combines the kind of work that I do as businessman and as an advisor to the Prime Minister. This helps the company evolve, and is what we are focusing on right now.</p><h4>The government is currently working on diversifying the economy and increasing industrial production. What is the importance of increasing your production here in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>Diversification has been very important for our economy since the first day of independence, but unfortunately the problem has not been solved yet. Oil and gas is something that Kazakhstan is known for. However, we don't give up and we are still looking for the possibilities for diversification. At this point we have identified agriculture, processing, and transit potential, as well as ecotourism. Of course, it is always better to sell petrochemical products as opposed to crude oil, or heavy equipment as opposed to metal. In terms of Raimbek Group, our strategy does not revolve just around Kazakhstan. We also have facilities in China, as well as CIS countries and the Caucuses, and our products are being sold in these regions as well. Kazakhstan has potential for zonal expansion as it is politically stable, and its geographical position is also very good. Raimbek is focusing on its resource base, and concentrating on three areas.</p><h4>How will the recent establishment of the Eurasian Economic Union support the expansion of your operations?</h4><p>The Eurasian Economic Union is a very complex matter. I am a part of the Council for Russian, Belarusian, and Kazakh Businesses, which is a part of the Commission for the Eurasian Economic Union. I am also monitoring some of the Kazakh businesses, and I have the experience of knowing how things are done with Kazakh businesses and other countries. Of course, the Eurasian Economic Union will introduce increased competition with Russian companies, but it will also allow Kazakh companies to enter the Russian market, which was previously not allowed. The new union will allow Kazakhstan to enter these markets, and barriers are being removed. Now the ball is in Kazakhstan's court, and the country has to realize the competitive advantages that have been identified by McKinsey and the Boston Consulting Group. Can businesses in Kazakhstan actually realize all of these competitive advantages? That will depend on their resource base, and management. Obviously the Eurasian Customs Union will be a challenge both for the Kazakh government and businesses, but it is much more interesting to work in a market of 170 million rather than just 17 million. It all depends on whether Kazakhstan can create an environment that fosters the expansion and development of companies.</p><h4>Since 2002, you have co-chaired the Council of the Forum of Entrepreneurs of Kazakhstan, which promotes the development of SMEs. In your experience, what has to be done to support entrepreneurial skills in the local community, and the growth of SMEs in the country?</h4><p>There are two things that we should focus on, and the first is the reduction of administrative barriers. This is something that President Nazarbayev has been advocating for a long time. It is a results-oriented process. These barriers impede the emergence of SMEs. The eradication of administrative barriers is very important. Secondly, we need infrastructure in place, and not just in terms of engineering, but also in terms of creating conditions for the development of various sectors, training, and support for the peripheral businesses and the transit economy. This is something that the government should work on and invest in, in order to create a good business climate.</p><h4>Can you share with us your business outlook for 2015? Do you have a specific goal?</h4><p>Our priority is the development of the resource base. We want to increase our international base in China and in the CIS.</p><div class="quote">“We have been focusing on the resource base, and also believe that vertically integrated holdings are not the right way to go."</div><p>© The Business Year - January 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the production of agricultural products and livestock evolved in the Beira Corridor since the establishment of the Beira Agricultural Growth Corridor (BAGC) in 2010?</h4><p>Agricultural production tends to go through cycles, depending on the nature of the seasons. But having said that, we have noticed a general increase in the level of productivity in terms of yields per hectare, especially at the level of smallholder farming. This is due to a slight increase in the use of improved seeds and chemicals, which roughly translates into a 15% rise in yields over this period.</p><h4>How is BAGCP collaborating with financial entities to improve small-scale farmers' access to credit?</h4><p>Banks are able, to some extent, to meet demand for seasonal and short-term investment finance, but when it comes to long-term finance, they have yet to figure out a way to provide financing windows that can be helpful to farmers and other agribusiness investors. We continue talking with them and other entities about the need for longer-term capital that will enable investments in long-term productive assets such as irrigation, fruits, and animal breeding stock. And additionally, addressing the issue of irrigation and irrigation infrastructure is paramount for the rapid growth of agriculture in the corridor.</p><h4>What products offer the greatest potential for the next few years in the Beira Corridor?</h4><p>The Beira Corridor is lucky in that it can support almost anything that one may want to produce. However, what has been coming through is fruit, such as lychees and avocados, which offer big opportunities. Right now, there are some large companies that want to undertake a major venture in lychee production. The livestock value chain is also producing opportunities, such as feed and processing facilities, and we have been talking to certain potential investors. Beef cattle, dairy, and poultry are clear focus areas, while horticulture is also important. Traditionally, rice is a significant crop in the Lower Zambezi and Sofala; the country continues to import almost all of its rice need, and therefore rice investments remain relevant. The challenge now is to produce it at competitively low cost.</p><div class="quote">“First of all, agriculture within the corridor needs to improve its competitiveness."</div><h4>What needs to be done promote exports from the Beira Corridor?</h4><p>First of all, agriculture within the corridor needs to improve its competitiveness. We need to reduce the costs of production for commodities such as fertilizer and livestock feed. The country is heavily dependent on imports and these come in two forms: finished products and raw materials. And because we are importing, we are also importing costs, which impacts our competitiveness. We have been discussing ways to reduce costs with the fertilizer industry by lowering taxes and improving on logistics. Part of this is the need to improve roads and other elements of transport infrastructure. Meanwhile, the financing of local businesses is a pressing matter in need of urgent attention, as inadequate financing is a major constraint on the ability of local businesses to grow through investment.</p><h4>How would you characterize the relationship between agriculture and mining in the Beira Corridor?</h4><p>The opportunities that the mining sector can provide, especially to support food production, are great. At present, neighboring countries produce the food consumed by the employees of mining companies. While the mining companies see this as a procurement problem, our institution, the Beira Agricultural Growth Corridor (BAGC), considers that long-term development of agriculture in the region would be a valuable solution. The BAGC is forging links between mining and agriculture by structuring demand and developing supply chains involving local producers. The mining companies' need for food gives local farmers a nearby market, especially during the construction phase. The role of the BAGC is to create incentives for local sourcing, and to develop core investment in local agricultural development. The other element is infrastructure. If there is coordinated planning, infrastructure for mines can also support the growth of other sectors. The mines are planning to build a railway line through Malawi to Nacala Port. Assuming that becomes open-access infrastructure, it could have a positive impact on agriculture.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the Beira Development Corridor Summit?</h4><p>The event will raise issues and take stock of where we are now, developments in the world of agriculture, and information on new programs that might prove helpful. It also builds consensus on priorities for investment areas. Investors can leave with better knowledge of the corridor, and information about where they can invest tomorrow. Also, the summit helps to highlight the things that we talk about every day; it will help to set the agenda. These issues can be solved.</p><h4>What are the competitive advantages of investing in agriculture in the Beira Corridor instead of other areas?</h4><p>The advantage of the Beira Corridor is that, historically, it has been a successful transport corridor and has been a focus of agricultural investments. We have a higher concentration of agriculture investors here than in other Corridors. The high presence of economic actors improves the economics of supplying infrastructure and services. It is for this reason that we advocate the clustering of more investors in the Corridor to improve the economic climate. If you look at the number of farmers here, we have a better supply compared to other locations. One of the reasons for this is the proximity of the corridor to other countries that are also significant trade partners such as Malawi, Zimbabwe, and Zambia, among others. Investors can move quickly between the Beira Corridor and these countries. For example, lychees can be exported quickly through Harare and arrive in Europe in under a week, allowing producers to reach premium sales windows ahead of competitors. The rainfall we receive, due to the mountains on the border with Zimbabwe, is high. We also have an advantage with regard to irrigation possibilities. All these things make the Beira Corridor attractive for investors. We also have a share of the extractive industries, such as the coalmines, which also boosts the local economy.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are Tanzania's strategies to attract additional FDI in regions other than the country's traditional FDI sources of Europe and the US?<br></h4><p>Let me first say that attracting investment, both local and foreign, is a major policy objective of the government of the United Republic of Tanzania. We are doing this because we believe in the efficacy and power of investment to promote growth and development for our country and our people. There is no growth without investment. There are no jobs without investment, and there is no development without investment. Let me hasten to say that we have put in place both investment policies and laws that are friendly and attractive to investors to make Tanzania their destination of choice. I am using the words “policies" and “laws" deliberately to underscore the fact that there are national investment policies and laws that cover all of these areas. Also, there are certain sectors that have specific policies, laws, and regulatory regimes, and this is due to the particular circumstances relating to those sectors or subsectors. Clearly, investment in oil and gas differs from investment in agriculture, tourism, or manufacturing. We are encouraging investors from all nations to come and do business with us. We neither have nations of preference, nor of disfavor. For historical reasons, Europe and the US have been our traditional sources of investment. Over the past two and a half decades we have witnessed major changes. Investors from other regions of the world such as Africa, the Gulf States, and Asia are becoming more proactive in investing in Tanzania. Investments from these regions have been increasing rapidly and catching up with the pioneers.</p><p>Tanzania's investment potential and business environment are being advanced, and the outcome has been far better than initially expected. Considerable interest has been shown by investors the world over. So far oil and gas, mining, agribusiness, manufacturing, tourism, housing, energy, and telecommunications and IT have been leading areas for attracting investments. As an investment destination of choice, it is important to note that our country has enjoyed uninterrupted peace and stability since Tanzania came into being over 50 years ago now. This has not been the case with several other African nations. We always pray and work for continuity, and we also want people to know that our membership of the East African Community (EAC) and the Southern African Development Community (SADC) represents huge market access which should be taken advantage of by investors. The 20 countries that comprise the two regional economic groups have a GDP of over $650 billion, a population of close to 400 million, and a sizeable middle class. Tanzania offers a market of 48 million people.</p><h4>What policies are you implementing to develop Tanzania's industrial output, specifically in terms of higher quality and value-added products?</h4><p>Seeing Tanzania become an industrialized nation has been a lifelong dream of its people and their leaders, before and after independence and the union between Tanganyika and Zanzibar. It is not a distant dream, as Tanzania has all it takes to become an industrial powerhouse in the region. There is a huge raw material base from agriculture, mining, forestry, marine products, and natural gas. The geography of our country presents an ideal position to make her become a regional industrial and commercial hub. As you know Tanzania borders eight countries of Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, DRC, Zambia, Malawi, Mozambique, the Comoros, and the Seychelles. Five of these are land-locked, and use Tanzanian ports, roads, and railways for their import and export business. As you may recall, in the year 2000, Tanzania announced its Tanzania Development Vision (TVD) 2025. The overarching objective was to develop Tanzania into a middle-income country by the year 2025. In 2010 we launched the Long Term Perspective Plan (2010—2015) to guide the implementation of Tanzania Development Vision 2025 for the remaining 15 years. The long-term plan was divided into three medium-term plans of five years each. It is important to note that the private sector is playing a more dominant role in Tanzania's drive to industrialization. Thanks to economic reforms, the private sector, instead of the state sector, became the engine of growth. The establishment of the Tanzania Investment Centre and the Export Processing Zones Authority has played an important role in what has been achieved to date. The future looks even brighter when the pipeline projects actually come to fruition. Much more will be realized, once the Mtwara and Bagamoyo Special Economic Zones become fully operational, over the coming few years. There are plans to establish Special Economic Zones in other parts of the country as well.</p><h4>What lessons or examples has Tanzania learned to ensure that its vast mineral and natural gas wealth ultimately benefits the development of the entire country?</h4><p>Indeed, we are cognizant of the fact that our national development is dependent on our natural resources, among other important factors. Fortunately, Tanzania is blessed with numerous minerals and substantial natural gas reserves. Tanzania has almost all minerals known to exist in the earth's crust, and some of these are present in large deposits. Since 2010 discoveries of sizeable gas deposits have been made and further discoveries are expected. This is putting Tanzania on the global map as one of the world's important sources of natural gas. Overall natural gas discoveries in Tanzania so far have reached 53.2 trillion cubic feet (tcf). Ensuring mineral and natural gas wealth benefits the development of the entire country is the essence of doing exploration and development of these resources. It begins with legislation, especially with regard to licensing and fiscal regimes. Fortunately, Tanzania has mining and petroleum development laws, which effectively take care of the interests and benefits of the country. Interests and benefits of investors have been taken care of as well. There is a win-win arrangement. Tanzania has come a long way. From time to time reviews of the mining policy, mining law, and regulations have been undertaken. Also, a number of other initiatives were undertaken. All these actions were meant to improve matters and ensure benefits to the country, investors and communities living around mining operations. During my administration we undertook reviews of the mining policy, mining law and regulations. Subsequently, in 2009 we came up with the New Mining Policy and in 2010 the new Mining Law was enacted. We also renegotiated Mining Development Agreements with certain companies to bring balance to both sides. We strengthened the mining audit, which saw companies pay corporate tax earlier than originally thought. We also became more proactive in engaging mining companies with regard to sourcing services locally so as to promote backward and forward linkages between the mining sector and other sectors of the national economy. New mining policy obligates mining companies to do more for their local communities. This way the local inhabitants also benefit and have a sense of participation. Thus far these initiatives have worked well for the country, as well as for investors, local communities, and the general population. Nonetheless, we have not ceased to seek ways of improving matters, and ours is always a work in progress. There are two scenarios with regard to natural gas development in Tanzania. The Songosongo and Mnazi Bay gas fields are fully owned by the state. The government funded exploration and discovery back in 1974 and 1981, respectively. It has entered into partnership with private companies for further development of the gas field and utilization. For this reason, proceeds from these gas fields benefitting the entire nation are assured. Fortunately, the terms of the partnership contract between the Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation and Wentworth Resources Limited for Mnazi Bay, and Pan African Energy for Songosongo, serve that purpose. The huge gas reserves discovered offshore present the second scenario, and are the product of private investment. According to the terms of the Production Sharing Agreement between the government of Tanzania and these companies, the interests of our country and her people have been adequately addressed. Of course, we are aware of voices being raised about local content, both in terms of benefits to local communities and of the participation of indigenous Tanzanians in the gas value chain.</p><h4>With 10 years left to the fulfillment of Vision 2025, how would you rate Tanzania's current progress toward becoming a semi-industrialized country?</h4><p>In the year 2000, the Third Phase government under President Benjamin Mkapa unveiled the Tanzania Development Vision 2025 (TDV 2025). The ultimate objective of TDV 2025 is to develop Tanzania into a middle-income economy by the year 2025. By 2025 Tanzania will be characterized by the following: high-quality livelihoods; peace, stability, and unity; good governance; a well-educated and learning society; and a strong and competitive economy. Since then much work has been done to implement the objectives of TDV 2025 with significant progress registered. In 2010 we gave better focus and structure to the actual implementation of Vision 2025. And after a comprehensive review of Tanzania Development Vision 2025 documentation we developed the 15-year Long Term Perspective Plan. The latter was meant to be a more focused guide to the implementation of the Vision during the remaining 15 years. Implementation of the long-term perspective plan was divided into three Five Year Development Plans. We are now implementing the First Five Year Development Plan (2010/11 — 2015/16), the focus of which is on unleashing the country's latent potential. After that we will implement the second plan from 2016-17 to 2020-21, where the focus is on industrialization, and the third and final plan from 2021-22 to 2025-26, which will focus on rendering Tanzania competitive in every aspect. I am confident, also, that the target is attainable and that Tanzania will indeed become a semi-industrialized country. The implementation of the Second and Third Five-Year Development Plans will deliver on these three ambitious objectives that will be underwritten by the gas economy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you see the monetary union affecting the Tanzanian economy in the long term?<br></h4><p>We feel it will be a positive influence in the sense that it gives you discipline. Once a country ties itself to a monetary union, with related macroeconomic benchmarks, you simply cannot afford not to be efficient. It involves a degree of sovereignty transfer, in terms of running your monetary and economy policy, to the East African Central bank to be formed. The current central banks will essentially become agencies of the main bank. All economic statistics will be monitored to assure efficient performance, and we are ready for that challenge. Firstly, we have cheap power that will if anything become cheaper yet, once we adopt natural gas as the main power source. Currently, we are the only nation on a 15 American cents per unit price of power; most others are on 17 or 18 cents. We should, therefore, be selling power to the rest of the region, rather than the more traditional fruit, grains and coffee. An economy becomes more competitive, not only in terms of exports, but also in terms of its own industry. A 5% drop in electricity costs can work wonders for a textile factory employing 3,000 people, making for a wholly different bottom line print. We feel we will be one of the stronger economies in the East African Community (EAC) because of the various resources that can be utilized to make life much easier for everybody.</p><h4>What EAC projects will be considered a priority for 2015?</h4><p>Universal power connectivity is our main objective, and will allow the grid to address supply deficit in one specific area by leveraging the entire grid. Meanwhile, the improvement of ports, railway lines, roads, and airports will be critical for trade and tourism. This would pay dividends in terms of making East Africa one consolidated destination for tourists. The other thing we are working on is telecommunications, as we are not quite integrated at this stage. The service providers are well-known brands, such as Vodafone, so there is no reason why we should not integrate this, and make it much easier to communicate with each other across borders. We are also working on a tripartite free trade area between COMESA, the EAC, and SADC. It is going to be the largest free trade area in Africa, reaching from Cape Town to Cairo, and will encompass more than half of the African population.</p><h4>What would the full economic and political integration of the EAC mean for the long-term development of Tanzania and East Africa?</h4><p>We feel that once we reach full integration, and for us that means a federation of the states of East Africa, one of the greatest dividends would be regional peace. Countries such as Tanzania, which have achieved peace and stability for a long time, can guide the rest. You would no longer, say, see an insurrection in Rwanda, as all neighbors would then rally as one federated state. In that sense you avoid a situation whereby groups want to cause unrest through another member state; it would be just one sovereign country. Therefore, we feel we can achieve peace throughout the territory. Secondly, there are tangible economic benefits. Take, for example, integration and the single currency; this is something that will create financial and economic discipline and render East Africa an attractive address for investors.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The IMF's 2009 conference on Africa was held in the context of a global economic crisis. Since then, how does a country such as Tanzania feature in the “Africa Rising" story?<br></h4><p>When we got together five years ago in Tanzania, Africa's economies were facing adversity as the global economy was enduring its most severe crisis since the Great Depression. When we met in May 2014 in Maputo for the follow-up conference, the narrative had indeed changed to “Africa Rising." Obviously, difficulties encountered by countries such as Ghana and Zambia, or the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, are strong reminders that African economies face many challenges and should continue to build their defenses against all sorts of shocks. But the changes over these five years have been dramatic. Africa's achievements have been remarkable, and the overall outlook for the continent is optimistic. Growth is expected to average at about 5.5% in 2014, and to remain strong in 2015 in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Together with other countries in the East African Community (EAC), Tanzania has been very much part of this story. Over the past decade, GDP per capita has increased by more than 50% (which is significantly more than the average for SSA); inflation has been kept in check; spending on social programs has increased markedly; macroeconomic stability has been preserved; structural reforms have been advanced; the standard of living has increased; and poverty has declined. Tanzania is an example of ongoing economic transformation for the region. Its exports now include the fruits of great progress in the area of manufacturing, including processed foods, beverages, cement, and textiles, just to name a few. That said, the fact that manufacturing still makes up only a relatively modest share of GDP, employment and exports in Tanzania also show that economic transformation requires the sustained implementation of reforms over the long haul. Tanzania needs to broaden economic reforms to make the economy even more resilient and to ensure that the benefits of growth can be even more widely shared among all Tanzanian people. The fact is that, like other countries in the region, poverty is still high and progress toward the Millennium Development Goals remains too slow.</p><h4>What is your medium- and long-term macroeconomic outlook for Tanzania?</h4><p>Tanzania's economic progress over the past decade has been commendable. The country grew by almost 7% over the past five years, and it is expected to remain at the same level in 2015 and over the medium term. The authorities have pushed for economic policies that have laid the groundwork for the country to transition from low-income status to become a middle-income country. Inflation has been controlled and is in line with the 5% medium-term objective. That is positive, given that the rate stood at almost 20% at the end of 2011. Having said that, there are some issues that need to be addressed. The key challenge is to meet both the government's fiscal policy objectives of preserving space for increased investment and social spending, while gradually bringing the deficit closer to its debt-stabilizing level. This was further complicated in the last fiscal year when revenue fell short of the ambitious targets set in the budget, which led the government to contain spending to meet the deficit target of 5% of GDP.</p><p>Tanzania now has a major opportunity. If the recent discoveries of offshore natural gas are commercially viable, they could generate significant exports and revenues during the next decade. Of course, further exploration is ongoing, and none of the potential investors has yet made a final decision on the project viability. But if managed well, these resources can be used to address pressing social problems, provide jobs for the young and growing population, and also to build-up the country's infrastructure. Of course, these are big “ifs." We have recommended that the government establish a transparent framework for natural gas taxation and wealth management, because the idea is to foster long-term inclusive growth and ensure inter-generational equity.</p><h4>The IMF's Executive Board recently approved a three-year Policy Support Instrument (PSI) for Tanzania aimed at supporting the country's efforts to maintain economic stability and to reduce the country's current account deficit. What actions must be taken by Tanzania to achieve these objectives?</h4><p>Over the years, we have worked hard with governments in Africa to reform our lending instruments, and we have also tailored our policy advice to better address the specific challenges facing the region. The PSI is designed for low-income countries that may not need financial support from the IMF, but seek to maintain a close policy dialogue with the IMF, including Fund endorsement and assessment of their economic and financial policies. The PSI signals the strength of a country's policies to donors, multilateral development banks, and markets. Tanzania's PSI, approved by the IMF Executive Board in July 2014, aims to support the government's medium-term objectives. These include the two issues that you have mentioned: the maintenance of macroeconomic stability and the preservation of debt sustainability. Other objectives include the promotion of more equitable growth and job creation, two areas that are crucial to Tanzania's future development and prosperity. With regard to macroeconomic stability, priority actions include strengthening public finance management in order to improve the efficiency and transparency of public spending, and the further broadening of the tax base to mobilize revenues and reduce aid dependence. In addition, the PSI is intended to strengthen the framework for monitoring and managing fiscal risks. Through these efforts, the program aims to provide the fiscal space to allow for spending on infrastructure and priority social programs. The government has identified infrastructure, education, health, and essential social services as priority spending areas for creating jobs and fostering inclusive growth. The program will also support efforts to ensure that potential revenues from offshore natural gas, which may start accruing in the 2020s if a large-scale gas project goes ahead, benefit all Tanzanians.</p><h4>Despite more than 5% average growth over 10 years, countries in SSA do not seem to be making progress in terms of creating jobs for their youth or reducing poverty and inequality. Why is this the case?</h4><p>Let's be clear. There has been progress. For example, the number of people living on less than $1.25 a day in Africa has fallen significantly since 1990. That is the result of the robust growth that so many countries have experienced; however, extreme poverty remains unacceptably high. And you are correct that high levels of inequality persist. There are various reasons as to why there has not been more progress. Some countries are still facing internal conflict and are struggling to exit fragility. In the medium term, sustained strong and inclusive growth can make a difference. For most African countries, this entails higher investment levels, economic diversification, the removal of constraints to the business environment, and urgent reforms to support job creation. Looking ahead, there are a number of longer-term demographic, technological, and environmental challenges that need to be addressed. For example, how can we tap into the productive capacity of Africa's youth? How about the evident potential of technological innovations? And, how can we address the implications of climate change for our natural resources? In response, three policy priorities are crucial. These include: building infrastructure, building institutions, and building people. Quality infrastructure—energy, roads, and technology grids—is a key foundation to any sustainable economy. Africa must also strengthen its institutional and governance frameworks in order to better manage its vast resources. And of course, the focus should also be put on building the capacity of Africa's greatest resources—its people—with programs aimed at boosting health and education and other essential social services, particularly for the poorest in each country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the Dar Es Salaam Stock Exchange (DSE) grown over the last year?<br></h4><p>It has grown significantly. In 2013, the local index, which we call the Tanzania Stock Index (TSI), grew by almost 100%. We doubled in terms of domestic market capitalization for the 12 locally listed companies. For total market capitalization, we experienced more than 25% growth. We have two indexes, a local index for domestic companies and an all share index for the whole market, including cross-listed companies. Some of the cross-listed companies did not do so well in 2013 in their primary markets. We have five that are cross-listed from Nairobi and one from the London Stock Exchange.</p><h4>The Tanzanian government recently released its plans to ease restrictions for foreign investors, especially for government bonds. How will these changes affect the DSE?</h4><p>The President has indicated that the government is in the final phases of enhancing capital account liberalization, and this will increase the level of foreign investors in our listed equities and also in the fixed-income instruments space. We believe that this might happen in the next 12 to 24 months. This, for us, is a great move because it will increase the investor base. Once you have that, then market forces tend to play a role and hence a better price mechanism and proper valuation for listed securities will emerge. And we will also be able to manage the pricing of these financial products.</p><h4>How would you assess the current level of foreign interest in investing in the DSE in light of these new reforms?</h4><p>The interest and appetite of foreign portfolio investors to participate in our market is high, both in the equity segment and on the fixed-income side. We receive a lot of queries as to when we will increase or remove the limits or restrictions that hinder foreign participation in our equity and fixed-income markets. Foreigners are allowed to participate up to a limit, and currently the ceiling is 60%. In the East African region, our limit in the lowest, followed by Kenya, which is at 85%. Uganda and Rwanda do not have the threshold, while Burundi does not have a stock exchange yet. It is important we note that most of the companies listed on the DSE have already reached or, in some cases, exceeded that limit. What this means is that, generally, foreigners are not allowed to participate in our market because, in most of the companies, the ownership limit has already been reached. Many foreign investors are keen to participate if we increase the minimum threshold. On the fixed-income side, we also receive many portfolio investors from abroad. As a country, we may decide to remove this restriction in a phased approach. We may begin by allowing East African investors to participate in our market, which is how other countries in the East African Community (EAC) are doing it. Many investors from other countries normally run their operations in the region through Nairobi. Once we allow investors from the region, such as portfolio investors and other similar types of investor, i.e. portfolio or fund managers, then we will tap some foreign investors beyond the region who are interested in our market.</p><h4>Could you please elaborate on your integration plans with Kenya and Uganda?</h4><p>We are part of the East African Securities Exchange Association (EASEA). With that association and the support of the EAC, we have been making significant progress. We are in different phases of implementing some activities, including initiatives toward regional securities issuances, regional stockbrokers, common securities trading, and depository and settlement infrastructure. We are now at an advanced stage toward introducing the regional infrastructure platform that will integrate our automated trading systems and our central securities depositories. The EAC Secretariat is spearheading the project, which will bring these exchanges together through ICT infrastructure, meaning that securities and investments will be easily moved across the region.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the importance of BG's assets in Tanzania in relation to BG's overall strategy?<br></h4><p>Tanzania is a great example of how BG works to its competitive advantages. Our group strategy focuses on the exploration and LNG segments. We entered Tanzania in 2010, driven by an exploratory analysis of the country's suitability and potential for exploration success, and natural gas exports to customers in Asia, where demand for energy is growing strongly. In addition, we saw an excellent opportunity to meet Tanzania's growing domestic energy needs. The early exploration work we did indicated that there were some potentially very large gas-prone basins, and to date we have made multiple discoveries, with total gross recoverable resources of around 15 trillion cubic feet. We've also made good progress on the proprietary work needed to advance the selection and acquisition of a site for an LNG terminal. This puts Tanzania squarely among the leading opportunities BG Group is pursuing, alongside Canada and the US, to expand our LNG business. We focus on identifying exploration opportunities early, moving swiftly to make discoveries, and then developing world-class LNG projects and supplying LNG into our global LNG marketing business. We are still at an early stage in Tanzania, but we have made an encouraging start.</p><h4>What are your short-term expectations regarding your ongoing exploration activities in blocks 1, 3, and 4?</h4><p>We've had a 100% success rate with offshore Tanzania so far, succeeding in 15 out of 15 wells since 2010. That's really amazing in this industry, where exploration wells often have a success probability of 10%-20%. A total of 10 of those were discovery wells, and the other five were appraisal wells, and we've also performed three successful drill stem tests on those discoveries. These have proven sufficient resources for a two-train LNG project. We are currently conducting further appraisal and exploration work, and we will be moving on to preparing for another phase of exploration, probably in 2016 or 2017. So we will be doing a lot of preparation work for that next campaign. What is really exciting is that, in addition to our exploration work program, we are now moving ahead with what we call the “select phase," where we conduct careful analysis of different options for developing the proven gas resources we have. This includes detailed design to determine the best configuration for our offshore and onshore facilities, as well as maturing the commercial structure of the entire project. Our joint venture partners, including the Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation, and also various government agencies, will be involved in maturing the commercial structure, with the signing of these agreements targeted for 2015. Overall, I'm proud of everything we have achieved to date, and I expect the next 12 months will be an exciting and pivotal period.</p><h4>How can Tanzania fully realize its vast potential as an LNG exporter?</h4><p>We have a large upstream project that we are developing, and we have formed a consortium to develop a joint LNG project. That is between ourselves and our partners (Ophir Energy and Pavilion Energy) in blocks 1, 3, and 4, and with the consortium for block 2, which is Statoil and ExxonMobil, that have also discovered significant gas resources. In 2012, the government asked us to explore the opportunity of building a joint LNG plant. It's a great opportunity for everyone involved because it saves on costs and is a more efficient solution. So we are working with officials on that, and we have now agreed with those five companies and the government to work together on the feasibility of that energy project over the next couple of years, with BG taking a lead role in the consortium. We've established a joint venture team with representatives from all organizations. We have an office here in Dar es Salaam and also one in London for that joint venture to progress the work. I am also very excited by the way that in both the joint venture for the LNG plant and the upstream operation, we are working very carefully and closely with Tanzania to help build a platform to maximize Tanzanian involvement in the project, and use the capacity of Tanzanian institutions and local companies to construct and operate the project.</p><h4>How is BG Group working to further increase its level of local content?</h4><p>We're dedicated to improving livelihoods and supporting development in Tanzania through our investment activities. We have only been here a few years, but we have already made some strides there. BG has established a dedicated offshore drilling supply base in Mtwara in collaboration with Ophir and Statoil. As part of this we have upgraded the port in Mtwara in collaboration with the Tanzanian Ports Authority (TPA), investing about $40 million, 70% of which has been invested through Tanzanian-registered companies. That involved working with them to make sure they're able to meet international oil and gas safety and quality standards. That has been successful, and it's a statistic we're very proud of. We're committed to continued work with the local government and companies in Tanzania to maximize local content throughout our operations, while maintaining the safety and quality standards that we expect. There are things we need to do to make that happen, obviously, as it isn't going to happen by itself. We have a big part to play, as has the government and other institutions. The key is to have the human capacity to take this on. So we are taking an education pipeline approach to that, and we have a number of social investment initiatives to support this approach. It is important to get young people interested in the key disciplines that are important in oil and gas, so we have a partnership with Young Scientists Tanzania (YST), which runs a science competition in schools in all regions of the country. The final factor starts at home; we have a lot of national staff in our organization, and a point we're particularly proud of is our international graduate development program. In the past two years we've recruited nine Tanzanians from universities. They then go on a two-year program where they work in three to four other countries that are part of our international operations around the world. After that they move into roles within the company. We have also been providing scholarships for higher education in science-related studies. From 2012 to date, 14 students have been sponsored to pursue Master's studies at British universities. Areas of study include Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Petroleum Engineering, Petroleum Geophysics, and Oil and Gas Chemistry. From 2012 to date, eight students have also been sponsored to pursue Master's studies in Materials Science Engineering at the Nelson Mandela Institute of Technology in Arusha.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[gas-on-the-mind]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What aspects would Statoil like to see included in Tanzania's upcoming Natural Gas Law?<br></h4><p>We would like to see enough flexibility to enable our project and other projects to progress. We also require laws and regulations that recognize the need for a return on investment. We have made comments on local content policy, gas policy, and the Petroleum Act. Now that the Natural Gas Act is pending, we have the opportunity to contribute, and it is up to the government and law making institutions to draft laws that are suitably attractive to investors. With regard to local content, I feel the impatience of many who would like to see companies staffed by Tanzanians, including upper management. I have been through the whole process back in Norway, and I know it takes time, but it will happen.</p><h4>As part of the joint venture responsible for Tanzania's future LNG plant, how do you see the export of LNG affecting the overall economy?</h4><p>There is a huge investment needed to bring the gas onshore. There is a popular misconception that the gas is there. Obtaining it requires a vast investment, which has to be financed. That is why the export of LNG is so important for us in this project in terms of paying for this development to generate a stable and predictable income, which is needed given the enormous up-front payments involved, before you derive any income. There is also the discussion about domestic gas use, which is extremely important politically for Tanzania internally. We completely understand that. Some of the gas will definitely be used domestically, and we are also investigating how this could be done. It is also a matter of establishing customers for this gas. It will take both substantial investment and time. It is important that an eventual gas based industry is profitable and able to pay for the gas, rather than giving away the gas to subsidize a non-sustainable industry. Tanzania, a huge country of 48 million people, will need more of this industry. One project will not transform the economy, thus some people are concerned at the prospect of the resource curse. There is no way that this development should change the whole economic situation for all of Tanzania, but it can make a big difference for people involved, government income, tax income, and the government's ability to actually develop the country in many ways that could make a major difference. It depends on the manner in which off-shore assets in Tanzania are developed. Tanzania, as with Mozambique, is well positioned in relation to other markets, namely those of China, Japan, and India. It could also tap into the South American market.</p><h4>What milestones does Statoil hope to reach in Tanzania by the end of 2015?</h4><p>We are working toward having a defined project by concept selection and to actually start up the front-end engineering. You then start significant engineering and field work to establish the basis for the final investment decision which will be about two years later. By the end of 2015 we should be in that phase. It all depends on the technical resource base and the technical solutions; we have still not qualified all solutions for our offshore development, which is a huge challenge in itself. The scheme involves 2,500 meters of water, and is located 100 kilometers off shore. Our ambition is to bring the gas to shore without having any offshore installations, namely via pipelines to shore. We have previously accomplished this in many major projects, but this one is more demanding in terms of depth, in this case, the seabed, which is challenging as a result of the deep valleys and hills. We also need to establish the commercial and regulatory framework.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you elaborate on the way your portfolio has developed over the years and the current flagship projects you are engaged in?<br></h4><p>We started operations fully in 1995, and worked exclusively for Shell over the following five years. After this, we diversified into working for other IOCs and Nigerian LNG companies in maintaining their pipeline transmission systems. We are seen as a company that comes with a strong technical background based on my vision and experience. I have worked for Schlumberger worldwide, and I returned to Nigeria in 1994 with the vision of building the country's capacity in oil and gas technical services. We started by building flow lines for Shell and eventually began building trunk lines and transmission pipelines for them, after which we started building facilities like manifold stations, including the largest of such facility in Nigeria (36-inch TNP Manifold in Ebubu). We have grown to the point where our service delivery covers the entire pipelines and flow lines of all sizes. The vast majority of pipelines we construct today are actually gas pipelines, not oil, because more and more gas pipelines are being built as distribution systems throughout the country. We are the primary indigenous construction company in this sector, having built over 30 pipelines, far exceeding the number that any other indigenous company has created. Oilserv is the only Nigerian company with the capacity to construct 10 pipeline projects simultaneously, and we are currently working on nine. On top of that, we are building a 48-inch diameter pipeline, which will be Africa's largest. We are talking about a full EPC contract, including maintenance for 24 months following construction, which is a capacity that no other contractor can ensure. We employ over 500 people and our activities are spread across Nigeria, and we also run additional operations in other African countries.</p><h4>How did you manage to position the company as the only indigenous player to provide world-class services?</h4><p>Capacity building is the key. I have a strong engineering background, whereby Oilserv is driven by my vision as an engineer. We started well before the Local Content Act was passed, and were already competing with international companies, winning jobs, and delivering them efficiently. The high quality of our delivery has given us a strong track record; however, it is not just about the delivery, as we are cost-effective, too. We deliver far cheaper results than the multinationals can, and our robust engineering background is the reason for this. From inception, we have trained our people in using a range of heavy-duty and specialized equipment, and we continue to do this. We choose between 30 and 40 graduates for our graduate program annually. As some of the university curriculum today in Nigeria is not adapted to specific industries, we have to guide graduates in the right direction in the oil and gas industry; therefore, we build capacity internally and train people to instill our culture of quality delivery in them, which is the only way to ensure satisfied clients. We are always in touch with the latest technology in pipeline construction. We are also one of the few companies with the capacity to deploy and operate horizontal directional drilling (HDD) systems that enable us to preserve ecosystems, and the first to deploy automatic and semi automatic welding systems on a large scale, when 90% of today's welding systems in Nigeria are still manual. This significantly increases the amount of joints we can weld in a day. Furthermore, we have brought more heavy-duty Volvo PL pipe layers to Nigeria, whereby capacity building and technological advancement have brought us to where we are today. Moreover, we reinvest in our business, resulting in a huge asset base spread over a large area, and our ability to handle this many projects simultaneously.</p><h4>Could you tell us more about the operations you are starting in Tanzania?</h4><p>We are bidding to execute a gas pipeline in southern Tanzania, which is several hundred kilometers. We have also expressed interest in building and developing 15 CNG systems. We are trying to become a major contributor to gas distribution within Tanzania. The government has a comprehensive plan and we want to be part of that. We told them that the key is that whatever we have done in Nigeria we would to replicate in Tanzania helping to train local people so that in the long term they will run all the systems themselves. One of the key factors that most East African countries see as appealing is solid plan backed up by experience in capacity building.And ultimately, capacity building is the only way to move forward.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your plans to expand your branch network in Tanzania?<br></h4><p>We plan to open at least two new branches over the next year. One will be in Mtwara where there is considerable potential due to the discovery of oil and gas. We want to be closer to our customers and also to be able to make use of subcontractors. At the industry level, the regulator is working on a program to ensure that the market is able to tap at least 10% of the large oil and gas business. We have a shopping mall branch in Mlimani City in Dar es Salaam, and are the only insurance company to be open daily, including Sundays and public holidays from 8AM to 7PM. Having seen the potential of the mall, we are planning to open one more branch within the year. Meanwhile, our distribution network simultaneously enables us to reach over 100 outlets nationwide.</p><h4>You operate in Kenya, Malawi, and Mozambique. What is the importance of the Tanzanian market for the company?</h4><p>The Tanzanian market is crucial because it contributes roughly 30% of the group portfolio. Tanzania also ranks number two in terms of turnover, and with a staff of 59 people we account for 50% of head office turnover.</p><h4>What would you say are the main trends within the Tanzanian insurance sector?</h4><p>The new trend is toward much greater social inclusion in terms of coverage. What we are trying to do is create affordable products that offer comprehensive coverage.  A good example is the farming community, for which we pioneered agriculture insurance i.e. tobacco insurance as this is the only crop where we have reinsurance protection. We plan to provide cover for other crops such as rice, maize, coffee, and cashew nuts. We are glad that farmers are finally beginning to see the importance of insurance.</p><h4>What are the challenges and opportunities unique to the Tanzanian insurance market?</h4><p>The main challenge is that the uptake of insurance is extremely low compared to other markets, at less than 1%. Moreover, awareness is low, and we as insurers are to blame in some ways. Insurance in our market is at the bottom of the priority list for most people who view it as irrelevant to their lives. Personally, I feel that insurance is the backbone of the economy, without which the financial services sector and all the sectors of the economy cannot function. Meanwhile, reaching the people  in the villages is another challenge, albeit bearing within it the opportunity of an untapped market through which up to 47 million people could benefit from a micro-insurance product. Nationwide coverage requires an industry-wide approach including the regulator and the government educating the public on the benefits of insurance.</p><h4>What would you say are your main achievements in the Tanzanian market and what would you hope to achieve over the next five years?</h4><p>My main achievement was to double our turnover. In 2010, our turnover was TZS9 billion, roughly $5 million. In just two years we reached TZS16 billion, and in three TZS18 billion, totaling at approximately $11 million. We have managed to pay dividends to our shareholders after five years where no payments were made. Importantly too, we have benefited from a stable team in terms of training and development. Turnover in the insurance sector remains high in Tanzania as the industry lacks adequate number of professionals. I would like to see our turnover reaching TZS50 billion.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will the Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation's (TPDC's) role evolve in light of new legislative changes?<br></h4><p>The role of TPDC is set to change significantly and the institutional change has already begun. The TPDC was formerly the regulator, monitoring companies as well as participating in exploration and licensing. This will no longer be the case, as the role of the TPDC will now involve actual exploration. The government has already allocated two blocks to TPDC and we plan to undertake exploration on our own, which is a major step for us. We cannot continue the previous role of regulator, as we cannot be both stakeholder and regulator simultaneously. The other significant change will involve the promotion and participation in the downstream segment. Given that there will be significant gas discoveries, we need to consider how best to commercialize them.</p><h4>What type of sharing arrangement will the TPDC have at its two new blocks?</h4><p>We will complete most of the basic work ourselves. We have already acquired the 2D study and are now completing the interpretation. We will close the 2D component, confirm the relevant structures, and then move into 3D scanning. The work we are doing is geared at reducing risk at the blocks, and we will eventually look for a strategic partner for the drilling stage. It will not be a PSA, but a strategic partner. In the near future, we are mobilizing a seismic acquisition group, which we are doing jointly with INP Mozambique. We will run seismic surveys on those two blocks, in addition to the ones on the grid. The 3D will be ready in the 4Q2014 or 1Q2015. We should undertake the actual drilling of the wells in those two blocks in 2015.</p><h4>Six international companies recently submitted bids for four exploration blocks. What factors are you looking for to determine the winning bid?</h4><p>We are looking at technical capabilities, financial capabilities, and the amount that the government will get from the PSA. Those are the three main factors that we take onboard. With regard to the government share, we had set some thresholds in the bidding documents, and it will be the companies' decision to move beyond those thresholds. If a company bids below the level, it will be out of the running. Currently, it is difficult to speculate on why companies are not bidding for the other blocks. It could be the water depth, or maybe there is the possibility that the acquired data did not emerge clearly. This is something we will have to think about once we have the evaluation.</p><h4>What sets Tanzania apart from countries with similar exploration opportunities?</h4><p>The terms we are offering are competitive for investors, in addition to which is the sense of security Tanzania instills. Ours is a reasonably stable country, with strong economic growth.</p><h4>How is TPDC involved in the development of LNG capabilities?</h4><p>TPDC fully participates in the development of LNG, and our objective is to establish an LNG plant in Tanzania. Our participation is crucial, in what is a vital project for the country, and we need to play an active role.</p><h4>What competitive advantages does Tanzania have in terms of becoming one of the world's leading LNG exporters?</h4><p>Tanzania's advantage is that developers are well-experienced companies, including such firms as ExxonMobil, which operates a number of LNG plants worldwide. BG has also built up several LNG plants, while Statoil owns a number of LNG facilities in Norway. These players are already well established and boast profound experience in the field. By contrast, none of our colleagues in Mozambique has built an LNG plant to date.</p><h4>What is being done to ensure that local content in these partnerships is of national benefit?</h4><p>The government is drafting a local content policy. This is being discussed with stakeholders and will subsequently be released to the public for scrutiny. Eventually, it will become a policy document backed by a loan, and even now we are working closely with the international oil companies (IOCs) to ensure that we are at least implementing and ensuring a stronger focus on local content. Thirdly, there is the issue of education. We are trying to educate people on the potential opportunities that are available for people to participate in. We also have a national program to educate people for employment in the industry. National universities have launched programs devoted to oil and gas, with the idea being to produce efficient professionals to staff this sector. The education program we are undertaking seeks to inform the general public of the opportunities and how they can take part in them. In addition, the gas policy requires companies to work closely with the communities in which they are based. The policy stipulates that the community should not be told what to do, but should rather have a participatory role. Communities should devise projects and the IOCs should see how they can assist in realizing them. The ideas should be coming from the communities.</p><h4>What are your priority targets for the end of 2015?</h4><p>Our primary target is to ensure that all power plants that TANESCO is installing are fed with gas. We want to ensure that TANESCO receives sufficient gas for their plants. The next project will be to reduce the impact of deforestation resulting from the construction of a pipeline that we are installing around Dar es Salaam to provide gas for industries, cooking, and vehicles. The design of the project is almost complete, and the next phase is to organize a contractor and arrange for financing.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the energy sector in general over the coming decade?</h4><p>The energy sector is progressing well, and remains the essential engine of development. This is why the government has decided that the pipeline project is key to ensuring sufficient gas supply, primarily for power generation, and also for industry. From Mnazi Bay, where there was a major gas discovery, the pipeline is 36 inches in diameter, and will come all the way to Dar es Salaam. There is another section from Songo Songo that will connect, via a 24-inch diameter pipeline, to Dar es Salaam. In the next 10 years, we expect double-digit GDP growth. Once there is sufficient power, it will be possible to attract a range of industries to the country. We expect that exports will also grow on the basis of the fact that there will be an industrial base that is provided with relatively cheap power.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the current environment for foreign energy companies trying to operate in Tanzania?<br></h4><p>If you consider the basics, Tanzania is in a relatively unexplored and underdeveloped region. It has considerable petroleum potential, as is evident from the gas that has already been discovered, and it has one of the fastest growing economies in Africa. At the same time, the strategic location of Tanzania is a huge bonus, and with adequate infrastructure it could become an economic gateway to Southern and Central Africa. That being said, we are of course in a tough neighborhood, as the past 50 years of the region's history have shown. But Tanzania stands out as being stable, which is of course a very positive attribute. The overall environment is therefore attractive in terms of the investment opportunities that exist, but it is challenging when it comes to dealing with the complicated processes for negotiating with the government and other local partners, obtaining the necessary permits and approvals, and dealing with the commercial and taxation issues and stakeholder relations once projects are up and running. A particularly challenging aspect of the investment environment recently has been TANESCO's inability to meet its payment obligations to private energy suppliers. This issue will hopefully be addressed by the government through the extensive restructuring and commercialization of the power sector that it has just launched. Another challenge is that even though the basic terms of petroleum exploration and development agreements are clear, the policy environment is still being defined. This makes the future value of oil and gas development investments difficult to project and thus enhances perceptions of risk. For example, the new Gas Act is expected to prescribe a gas industry structure that was not envisaged under the existing production sharing agreements.</p><h4>How confident are you that the Gas Act, currently in its draft stage, will address most of the sector's major framework concerns?</h4><p>It is difficult to describe how a shoe fits without wearing it first. Issues will definitely arise during the anticipated discussions about the Gas Act, in which stakeholders will seek to further safeguard their interests. Although the stakeholders have an overriding common interest, they nevertheless will have competing sub-interests. No doubt we will see stakeholders attempting to  have the Gas Act crafted so that their interests and concerns are addressed. It will be difficult to completely satisfy any stakeholder or group. The key will be to strike a balance that everyone can live with, the overriding consideration being to facilitate the optimal, efficient development of the gas industry within the boundaries set by natural gas policy. Once we start implementing the Act, issues that the stakeholders had not foreseen will probably emerge, and that may require amendments to legislation or new regulations to iron those issues out.</p><h4>How would you characterize PanAfrican Energy's (PAE's) role in the NNGIP?</h4><p>The company's involvement will be simply as a supplier of some of the gas that will be needed in order to bring the new NNGIP pipeline into operation. PAE is expected to provide up to 100 million cubic feet per day to the NNGIP. However, production will have to be doubled to 200 million cubic feet per day. As I mentioned earlier, we are currently in negotiations with the Ministry of Energy and Minerals and TPDC about the gas price and other terms that will enable PAE to secure financing from the International Finance Corporation (IFC) to double gas production. We are talking about an initial investment of about $150 million in order to drill new wells, service some of the existing ones, and install additional infrastructure.</p><h4>What is PAE's long-term future in the country?</h4><p>Tanzania has and will continue to have many opportunities for energy sector investors. As long as those opportunities are assessed to make business sense, PAE's will consider pursuing them. The company took nearly a decade of hard work to earn the government's final approval to invest in Tanzania, and it has now been here for a decade producing gas reliably, with no major problems or incidents, generating most of the power in the national grid and for the largest industries in Dar es Salaam. We would obviously want to continue that way indefinitely.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>During the first quarter of 2014 your profits rose by 42% YoY. What are the main drivers of this growth for Exim Bank?<br></h4><p>Several factors have contributed to Exim Bank Tanzania's exponential growth. Ours has been a story of 'growth by self-evolution.' The bank is uniquely placed in the banking sector which is occupied by over 50 players, with some of the major international names having a direct or indirect presence here. Despite being an indigenous entity, the bank has been able to create its own niche within the short span of 16 years, attaining 5th position in terms of total assets, on a sustained basis for the past few years. The bank enjoys a very strong brand, built over its ability to facilitate and convert 'opportunities into reality' by providing faster turnaround on banking services. It is also known as being one of the most innovative banks in the country, having introduced many new concepts. Be it the pioneering introduction of credit cards in the country (in affiliation with MasterCard International), facilitating the exchequer with automated collections at the prestigious Tanzania National Parks (TANAPA Cards), or being the first Tanzanian bank to establish a banking footprint overseas with the establishment of its first wholly-owned subsidiary in the Union of Comoros, it has remained at the forefront when it comes to creating value for its patrons. With a view to ensuring sustainable growth and remaining among the industry leaders, the bank has embarked upon a transformation drive—with a focus on three key pillars: people, processes, and technology. The idea is to attract the best talent in the industry and retain it, supporting it with the best in class technology, and building strong processes for efficiencies and improved controls. We have sought the assistance of some the world's leading firms as advisors to take us through this process, and I am happy to share that progress thus far has been rather encouraging. We hope to accomplish the task by 4Q2015. The medium term vision is to be a strong regional bank that relies on best practice models. Beginning in 2014, we have started seeing the desired impact of these initiatives. With effective funds management, net interest margins improved noticeably. Non-interest income also fared well, led by treasury and forex gains, and supported by fee income from non-fund business and alternative channels. It is noteworthy that this is despite a jump in operational costs arising due to initiatives as shared earlier. We are hopeful that during the rest of the year we will further strengthen our dedication to our vision.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on the bank's expansion strategies?</h4><p>With digitalization transforming many aspects of modern life, it is imperative to factor this phenomenon into the distribution strategy of the bank. While the bank is in a process of crafting its distribution strategy for the year 2015, the focus shall be to further tap the potential within existing markets. The bank will endeavor to establish its base at key centers such as Dodoma and Kahama, while further broad basing our presence in Dar es Salaam, Arusha, and Mwanza. We are also keeping a close eye on regional developments related to the opening up of CAC (Capital Account Convertibility) within the East African region.</p><h4>What are the main strategic points of your 2016 Vision?</h4><p>Building upon our ability to provide a faster turnaround and a loyal customer base, the bank revamped its branch management structure earlier in 2014, to become more focused on sales.  Common back office activities are being centralized so that the branches will be able to devote much of their time to understanding the needs of the customer and service them in the manner they want. We aim to be the leader in payments and also to increase our market share in CASA by 50% from the existing nearly 5% to about 7%. We have sourced a state-of-the-art 'switch' solution on an outsourcing model, to provide the right platform to not only remain contemporary with the digital world of banking, but for introducing value added digital solutions matched to the local needs, with ease of implementation. The relationship model of managing our corporate, HNI, and SE clients is expected to give us a competitive edge and boost our market share on low cost deposits. Some novel offerings for corporates and retail clients are soon to be introduced.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the participation in social security grown in Tanzania since last year?<br></h4><p>Since 2013 it has grown to encompass 8% of the working population. The main driver for this growth is that pension funds have started implementing section 30 of the Social Security Regulatory Act No. 8 of 2008, which opens it up for everybody. Even the informal sector now is allowed to join social security, which is different from in the past when you had to be formally employed in order to access social security services. Mandatory pension funds have established supplementary schemes that accommodate the informal sector. They came out with products and services that suit them. For example, for collection you do not have to go the offices; you can send through M-Pesa, Airtel Money, or Tigo Pesa. You can use mobile money to send contributions, and they are also flexible in terms of frequencies; they can contribute on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis, which is different from the traditional scheme in which you had to contribute monthly. They are also taking contributions in the form of commodities for supplementary schemes. For example, through collection centers farmers can contribute in terms of kilograms of tea, liters of milk, or trays of eggs, for example. This flexibility has encouraged other people to join social security schemes.</p><h4>How is the Social Security Regulatory Authority (SSRA) working toward a universal pension fund?</h4><p>The universal pension fund is something we are still working on, and we are presently working with the Ministry of Labor and Employment in reviewing the previous policy because it was developed in 2003, and some areas are already outdated. We have carried out study visits and established a task force to deal with it. When this is complete, the framework will be established for a universal pension. We only want to be sure that the scheme is affordable and sustainable. As you can see in Article 11 of the Constitution, social security is a constitutional right, but there is no obligation to contribute. We have sent our recommendation that places social security contributions as the obligation of every Tanzanian. If everybody with an income contributes a certain amount for an old age pension, this will ensure the sustainability of the universal scheme.</p><h4>What other regulatory changes are priorities for the social security sector?</h4><p>We are currently working on the harmonization of benefits. This is the current top priority. We have a common contribution rate, which is 20%, but the benefit packages differ significantly across the schemes, so we want to harmonize, and make benefits adequate and the system more sustainable. The beauty of the Tanzanian social security system is that the sector is dominated by (defined benefits) pension funds with generous replacement rates. This guarantees a certain degree of adequacy. Further, the schemes are guaranteed by the government, while most of the countries in East Africa have defined contributions schemes. Looking at portability issues with a government-guaranteed pension fund, it is important to have a well-structured system in order to avoid the unnecessary burden that may result from labor movements across the region. Alternatively, we have recommended coordination to accommodate this. So if you have someone from Burundi, Kenya, Uganda, or Rwanda working in Tanzania, they can contribute in Tanzanian schemes and when they go back it can be arranged for them to be paid in their home countries.</p><h4>What are the SSRA's targets for 2015?</h4><p>The target is to increase coverage through awareness, harmonized benefits, and innovation. We have developed a communication strategy, as one of the main challenges we face is the fact that public awareness of social security is remarkably low. The communications strategy has identified the penetration rates in different forms of media that will be used in building awareness. As we speak, we have started an awareness campaign. As well, we are working closely with the Ministry of Labor and Employment on the harmonization of benefits and the universal pension system. By the end of 2015, we are looking at having another round of reviews for our legal regulatory framework as well. We are aiming to create a unified law to cover all social security schemes. Currently, we have five different pieces of legislation covering these schemes. By 2015, we expect between a 10% and 12% participation rate. Currently, formal employees are about 80% covered, and we are planning to reach 100% coverage.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on your social security awareness campaign?</h4><p>We have a number of interventions, and hold specific seminars for workers through trade unions, employers associations, members of parliament, and policy makers at the governmental level, and we also run “social security week" where we engage with the public. In other areas, as the government employees' provident fund has changed to a pension fund, we need to educate its members and the public to eliminate misconceptions, specifically because we have been receiving a lot of requests for awareness. We also have 55 colleges of social development that need awareness seminars, as well as 12 higher learning institutions. This is a massive campaign carried out at the regional level in collaboration with the Ministry of Labor and Employment, trade unions, and employers associations. Another way that we are doing this is through publications and electronic media. We also have TV programs, and conduct different debates and dialogues with stakeholders.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the current focus of TANESCO's restructuring process?<br></h4><p>The restructuring of Tanzania Electrical Supply Company (TANESCO) is ongoing and taking place in two phases. The first phase consists of what we call the TANESCO Internal Reforms. We are focusing on four key areas here. These reforms will bring improvements to our operational performance, while another area of focus will bring improvements in business, especially business growth. The third area will improve customer service. Finally, we are also implementing reforms that will improve upon the effectiveness of our human resources. In the first area, which focuses on improving organizational performance, we are looking at areas such as procurement, where we want to restructure functions and create specialized sections in the procurement pool. The first section will be dealing with generation and transmission procurements. Another section will be the distribution procurements. The third one will deal with general procurements and the fourth will oversee the procurement of major projects and consultancies. We are also planning to decentralize procurement, with most being done from regional zones. The head office will only deal with a few high cost, or specialized procurements. We also want to decentralize the business in terms of balance sheets and P&amp;L accounts, so that each region acts as a profit center, with its own balance sheet, and its own profit and loss account. We are also investing in ICT to support the business. Our expectation is to see improved revenues, customer service, as well as stake-holder and customer relations, and to improve our public image. That is our number one priority. Second in importance is the reform being pioneered by the government, which encompasses the whole sector and not merely TANESCO. We are highly involved in this, as TANESCO accounts for almost 80% of the sector. Therefore, reforming the sector by definition means reforming TANESCO.</p><h4>What role will the private sector have to play for Tanzania to meet its energy demands?</h4><p>The role of the private sector in the energy sector in terms of TANESCO's business is crucial because neither the government nor TANESCO have sufficient capital to realize all the investments that we are faced with. At the same time, experience shows that private-sector participation goes hand-in-hand with new technology, capital, fresh ideas, and new experiences, which is exactly the case today. We have seen a great deal of interest from the private sector; for example, we have two Chinese companies at Kinyerezi III and Kinyerezi IV. In fact, they are participating as a public-private partnership (PPP). We have a joint venture with CPI and another with Poly Group and both, again, are Chinese companies. We also have a PPP arrangement with Symbion Power, a US company. We have independent power producer (IPP) arrangements with two Tanzanian companies; Kilwa Energy operating in Kilwa, and Kamal Steel operating in Palumbo. These companies operating in the country have already shown great interest, and we know that as we progress many more companies will show interest in working with us.</p><h4>What will Tanzania's natural gas discoveries mean for the country's power generation?</h4><p>Today, the key focus is to increase power generation from natural gas. By the end of 2015, we aim for a total capacity of 3,000 MW, predominantly from natural gas. In the long run, we are going to improve on the generation mix; however, our interest for now is to quickly ensure adequate natural gas power generation to reduce cost. Currently, we have idle gas that cannot be utilized because it has no real market. As we expand on power generation and construct the pipeline from Mtwara, we are set to utilize the idle gas in Mtwara. At the same time, we are undertaking significant deep-sea exploration and drilling for gas earmarked for liquefied natural gas (LNG). The amount of natural gas to be used for power generation is small compared to the discoveries.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How successful has the e-Government initiative been so far in regard to its goal of increasing efficiency?<br></h4><p>Let me put it this way, the e-Government Agency (e-GA) is a fairly new government institution; it is only about two years old. But we began to leverage ICT for improved service delivery and efficiency even before e-GA was created. There have been some successes, such as the Integrated Financial Management System and the Human Capital Management Information System. What e-GA is doing is to accelerate, improve, coordinate, and expand these efforts. We want to improve efficiency, to make the government more accessible and accountable to the general public, as well as to streamline, harmonize, and coordinate ICT in government. We also want to establish various standards for ICT applications across government departments, build capacity in ICT among the various ministries and departments, and install the related infrastructure. We already have in place the ICT fiber-optic broadband backbone, and are now working on last-mile connectivity issues to ensure we can connect as many government offices as possible. We are working on an integrated government-wide network to bring the whole government together and avoid unnecessary duplication and parallel systems. We are trying to create a closed government cloud that is accessible 24/7, along with a dedicated and secure government mailing system. Overall, we are fairly on track to achieve these targets. We are also trying to create a government service mobile platform so that citizens can access services on their mobile phones, which most people today have access to, without having to visit government offices. Not only will this save time and money for both citizens and the government, but also by minimizing face-to-face contact between citizens and government officials we can reduce the opportunities for corruption.</p><h4>How has the increase in e-governance benefited Tanzania's open government initiative?</h4><p>Tanzania joined the open government initiative in 2011 because we strongly believe that the government should be more open to its citizens and to have a more interactive government with an ongoing dialogue with its citizens. We believe in open government, and much of what the government does should be accessible to the public. In doing so, we will empower the public to hold the government accountable. My other wish is that one day, for example, a farmer will be able to use his mobile phone to take a picture of a crop that is not doing well, and upload it to agricultural extension officers, enabling the officers to provide a solution promptly. Or, if there is a water point in a city or rural area that is not working, someone can take a picture and upload it to the relevant officials who can locate it by GPS and arrange for immediate repair. This possibility is not too far off, either. The technology is there; we just need to implement it. There is a cost in terms of human and financial resources. Yet, efficiency gains will ultimately compensate for the costs.</p><h4>Tanzania also recently began implementing the Big Results Now (BRN) initiative. How would you rate the progress of the first year of this program?</h4><p>We have made excellent progress considering the teething problems we encountered. We agreed as a government that this is what we are going to do and that we will closely monitor performance in key results areas (KRAs) on a weekly basis to make sure that those implementing priority projects are always on track. This also helps to identify and resolve problems early on. The main problem was financing. Our philosophy is that a plan without a budget is only a draft. There is no point in giving someone key performance indicators (KPIs) without the money to meet those targets. We identified six main KRAs. These are agriculture, education, resource mobilization, energy, central transport corridor, and water. We have just added a seventh KRA, which is business environment. I think we have done quite well in most of these priority areas. The latest evaluation results confirmed unprecedented performance, and attribute this to the new way of doing things. In education, for example, we had intended to re-train about 3,500 teachers in new ways of delivering the curriculum, and we have managed to train about 3,000, so we are almost on target and are beginning to see results in terms of school performance. Regarding water, by June of 2014, after only one year of BRN, we were able to provide 2.8 million people in rural areas with connections to clean water. This is at least five times the highest rate we have ever achieved since independence in a single year. Resource mobilization has helped us reduce the fiscal deficit from TZS6 trillion to TZS5.648 trillion because of the identified new sources of revenue. In energy, by June 2014, 36% of the population had access to the power grid. The connection rate is now at 24%, compared to only 10% in 2002 and 13% in 2007. The biggest jump occurred after we began to implement the BRN initiative.</p><h4>With some 10 years left to achieve Vision 2025, how optimistic are you about meeting the set goals, especially considering the progress of recent years?</h4><p>I think we are going to get there. I am optimistic when I take into account what we have achieved so far, especially in the past few years. The reason we introduced the BRN initiative is because we began to worry that we wouldn't meet the targets. Now, with BRN, I am confident that we will succeed. For example, the economy is growing at an average of 7% per annum, which is strong growth, and I am sure it will reach 8% in the near future. In per-capita income terms, it was $652.1 in 2012 ($742 in current US dollar prices). But, we are now rebasing the data. From the initial figures we have, this will increase GDP substantially. The World Bank is trying to validate the numbers, but by September we should have the new GDP data. We expect the new data will confirm that we are now on track to becoming a middle-income country by 2025. Other important numbers include the extreme poverty rate, which was 9.7% in 2012 compared to 16.6% in 2007. People living below the basic needs line amounted to 28.2% in 2012, down from 33.6% in 2002. All this shows that we are on track, and all numbers point in the right direction. Life expectancy is now at 61 years, up from 50 years in 1988. Literacy is at 78.1%, up from 69% in 2002. When we look at these numbers, and with the commitment we have, we have every confidence that we will meet our 2025 targets. The future is optimistic.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the greatest successes achieved thus far by Tanzania's foreign policy transition to “economic diplomacy" and how would you rate its overall performance since its implementation?<br></h4><p>The  success achieved by Tanzania's foreign policy's transition to economic diplomacy has been impressive. Stable growth rates, a stronger engagement in global economic and financial cooperation, and support from our trade and development partners have come as a result of this new policy mode. As a result, Tanzania has been among the fastest-growing economies for the past decade. With the discovery of oil and gas deposits, we are expecting to see even more economic growth. Second, the increase of FDI inflow and portfolio investment has become an important source of financing and economic development, especially in emerging and developing countries. Due to its importance, it has been actively sought after by virtually all emerging and developing countries. Tanzania has made considerable efforts over the past three decades to improve the investment climate here with a view to attracting more FDI. Major policy and structural reforms were carried out since the mid-1980s to target the improvement of the business and investment environment. These efforts have resulted into an increase in FDI inflows. According to the “Tanzania Investment Report 2012," FDI stock in Tanzania rose steadily at an average rate of 10.3% per annum from $463.4 million recorded in 2000 to $10.39 billion in 2011. This is a result of joint efforts made by all the stakeholders involved with economic diplomacy in promoting the available investment opportunities. The economy of Tanzania depends on the economic situation and security of its trading partner countries, as well as the global donor community. The economic downturn that occurred in 2009 in the major world economies impacted our economy, and a decline was observed in FDI inflows. In 2010, inflows bounced back, but declined again in 2011 following the large repayment of a number of short- and long-term loans. FDI inflows have averaged $1.34 billion per annum over this period.</p><h4>Beyond Tanzania's traditional sources of FDI, what other countries or regions has your Ministry identified as being potentially significant investment partners?</h4><p>FDI plays an imperative role in Tanzanian economic development, and our nation as a whole. For our economy to grow to the required extent, we need to have strong development partners in this segment. Its impact on the local economy has been in terms of improved job creation, government revenue, technology and skill transfer, capital investment, and foreign exchange earnings. However, going beyond our traditional partners, we are now looking to attract investment from the economic regional blocs we are involved in, as well as BRIC countries and the Asian tiger economies.</p><h4>What are the Ministry's strategies to increase the exposure and accessibility of Tanzania to foreign investors?</h4><p>The Ministry, in collaboration with other ministries, departments, institutions, and the private sector, will continue to implement economic diplomacy by attracting strategic investors to come and invest in various sectors in the economy. To this end, our strategies include the building of an enabling environment for economic growth, the strengthening of international partnerships, giving priority to economic objectives in bilateral cooperation, strengthening multilateral cooperation, improving relations with our neighbors, and improving regional cooperation. Our participation in various meetings such as joint permanent commissions, bilateral meetings, and regional and international meetings, as well as official visits abroad by our leaders and the official visits of foreign leaders to our country, are crucial to the realization of our goals. For these to happen, the Ministry will coordinate investment forums and facilitate the participation of Tanzanian companies in international trade fairs in addition to establishing trade/investment/tourism desks at all Tanzanian missions.</p><h4>How do you see Tanzania's foreign policy and position in the region evolving over the long term?</h4><p>Since independence, Tanzania's foreign policy has been focused on promoting friendly relations with all nations and on playing a constructive role in the UN, the African Union (AU), and other international bodies. Despite the fact that the new foreign policy is placing an emphasis on economic diplomacy, particularly strengthening economic cooperation with our development partners, it still continues to sustain the major principles of traditional foreign policy. Hence, the Ministry is keen on  defending our sovereignty and the right to decide  our own affairs, and promoting good neighborliness. Tanzania identifies with the goals of the AU and the UN as well as the policy of non-alignment. We fundamentally respect human rights and equality, and we still believe in being a non-aligned country. In view of the deepening process of economic globalization and the impact of trade liberalization, Tanzania has put emphasis on regionalism in order to create synergies through economies of scale, as well as strategic partnerships to strengthen domestic markets, attract investments, and create new platforms for beneficial integration into the global market.</p><h4>As an example of stability and security, how is Tanzania working with member countries of the East African Community (EAC) and the Southern African Development Community (SADC) to increase security throughout the region?</h4><p>Tanzania has been an active Member of both the EAC and the SADC for a number of years now. Both the EAC and the SADC advocate economic policies for the benefit of all partner states. Therefore, the idea of maintaining peace and stability among member countries is of paramount importance. For example, Tanzania is working hand-in-hand with other member countries in formulating a Regional Strategy for Peace and Security for the EAC. Since the inception of the EAC in 1999, the organization has taken bold steps to create a framework and structures to address security issues. This treaty recognizes peace and security as pre-requisites for the success of the EAC regional integration process. Developed through a highly consultative and inclusive process, this strategy will anchor peace and security sector activities, giving form to the areas of cooperation in addressing regional threats. In terms of the SADC, Tanzania has actively participated in efforts at peace creation and peacekeeping in the region, including sending of troops to the Eastern DRC as part of the Force Intervention Brigade following  a request of the UN Security Council. The mandate was to fight against rebels of M-23, who were ultimately defeated and forced to surrender in early March 2014. M-23 signed the Nairobi Declaration to denounce armed rebellion and laid down their arms.</p><h4>What steps is Tanzania taking to balance the economic integration of the region with core national interests?</h4><p>The creation of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in 1963, which became the AU in 2000, was aimed at integrating African countries into one powerful, united continent. This is because most African countries had small markets, limited power infrastructure, an unfavorable business environment, conflicts, and a poor industrial base. Subsequently, African leaders, including the Father of the Tanzanian Nation, Mwalimu Julius Nyerere, stressed the creation of a unified African nation on a step-by-step approach. In this regard, Tanzania has been an active member of both the EAC and SADC, and through these regional economic communities member countries have expedited several infrastructure projects and are striving to maintain peace and security.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the current level of bilateral cooperation and economic relations between Singapore and Tanzania?<br></h4><p>It has never been better. President Jakaya Kikwete's visit to Singapore in June 2013 generated new momentum in our bilateral relations. Since then, we have inked four Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) and an Open Skies Agreement. President Kikwete and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong also had a chance to speak over the course of the Commonwealth Heads of Government (CHOGM) Summit in Sri Lanka in November 2013. I myself had the good fortune to visit Dar es Salaam in June 2014 with a Singaporean business delegation for the Tanzania-Singapore Business Forum, and the rapid pace of development in the country impressed us all. Needless to say, we felt very welcomed. Tanzania's huge potential is reflected in our bilateral trade, which has risen steadily in recent years (SGD187.7 million in 2013). Singaporean companies are now present in the coal, agriculture, shipping, and steel sectors in Tanzania. Our businesses have also shown increased interest in understanding and exploring the Tanzanian market. The Singapore Business Federation, for example, has organized two business missions to Tanzania since 2013. Tanzania also participated in the recent Third Africa-Singapore Business Forum, a major platform that drew more than 600 top businessmen from Africa and Singapore.</p><h4>Highlighted by Pavilion Energy's $1.28 billion investment in Tanzania's energy sector, Singaporean investors are beginning to look beyond Asia toward Africa. What opportunities are there for such investors in East Africa, and especially Tanzania?</h4><p>East Africa is attractive to investors due to its relative stability, the abundance of arable land, and the availability of natural resources. More recently, oil and gas finds have encouraged more foreign investment. Tanzania is a suitable investment destination for companies, due to its political stability and recent economic reforms. Companies already doing business in Tanzania should explore opportunities in moving up the value chain in the long term. Oil and gas companies can explore developing downstream activities such as refineries, while agriculture companies could introduce agri-technologies, such as fertilizers and other machinery. Beyond natural resources, I believe the next phase of growth will be driven by the region's youthful population and burgeoning middle class.</p><h4>Besides the energy sector, which other sectors in the economy have you identified as having the most potential for cooperation between Singapore and Tanzania?</h4><p>There are numerous areas of potential. The first is education. Tanzanian policymakers understand that the development of human capital is vital for the country's long-term economic development. They have identified vocational education as a key sector for job creation and have directed significant resources toward improving the national education system over the past decade, with public expenditure per student more than doubling since 2005. There are ample opportunities in this regard for Singaporean companies, such as Informatics Education and the Institute of Technical Education (ITE), to establish themselves in Tanzania and the broader East African region. The area of transport and logistics has also emerged as a key sector. Tanzania's proximity to Asia makes it the natural transhipment gateway to inland Africa for Asian products. Given Singapore's port and logistics expertise, a number of opportunities are present for Singapore to further boost the connectivity inside and outside of Tanzania. Finally, the public sector also presents opportunities in capacity building, and e-government services are another possible area. Singapore's experience in public sector management and the design and implementation of e-government systems is highly relevant in this sector. East Africa is one of the most connected regions in Africa. Governments are embarking on projects to not only improve their business environment, but also to become more transparent.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the importance of Tanzania's participation toward the successful integration of the East African Community (EAC)?<br></h4><p>Tanzania is a key member of the EAC, as one of the founder nations. It is an important growing economy, especially in the non-oil sector, with growth in tourism, financial services, mining, agriculture, and more recently, gas. In terms of contributions to the EAC, Tanzania has been significant, and will remain so.</p><h4>How satisfied are you with the current progress of integration within the EAC?</h4><p>Given that the customs union has only been in place since 2005, witnessing the gains that have been made through what is now a common market, not to mention having established the framework of a political federation, is extremely impressive. Of course, the challenges are immense and further momentum is required.</p><h4>What are the most pressing challenges for the EAC?</h4><p>The challenges predominantly lie in infrastructure. We need investments, such as in rail and energy, to further unlock development. We also need to invest in the right skills. Ours is a young, growing, urbanized population; however, we need to ensure that it has the requisite skills to grow the economy of tomorrow. We must also produce more jobs, and finally there are still obstacles to integration. We need to remove non-tariff barriers to trade, such that services and people are able to move seamlessly within the EAC.</p><h4>As the Secretary General, what milestones would you like to see the EAC reach by YE2015?</h4><p>In 2015, we will see the single customs territory in full operation. In 2014, it was rolled out on a pilot basis for the northern corridor. Thus far, it has been highly successful for the products involved. We want to strengthen it, and ensure it is fully functional in 2015. We are working on an EAC passport, and hopefully by 2015 the respective heads of state will be in a position to launch it. We are also working on airspace liberalization and deeper fiscal integration.</p><h4>How would you assess the political will from member states to cooperate on common EAC goals? What would be the economic effect of greater integration among them?</h4><p>I believe the will is there, as all leaders in East Africa are committed to integration. However, the speed of integration varies from country to country. Integration has already yielded solid benefits. Growth is up across the board, as are revenues. Intra-EAC trade has more than doubled, growing at almost 36% YoY. We are also seeing freer movement of labor, whereby graduates are moving across the entire region, widening their opportunities. Tourism, too, is on the rise, and will grow further in the advent of a single tourism visa. Indeed, this tourism growth is registering even amid concerns over security. Overall, I think this integration has already been greatly beneficial for the average East African. And with deeper integration there can only be greater benefits to reap.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Value Chain Ahoy!]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[value-chain-ahoy]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why is it necessary for Ecuador to transform its productive matrix?</h4><p>The National Strategy for the Change of the Productive Matrix was a response to the prevailing conditions of our country. When the government entered office, Ecuador was a country with serious deficiencies in energy and infrastructure. There was also a lack of investment in roads, ports, and airports. We also had the second-lowest broadband penetration in all of Latin America, as well as many other challenges. Having had a dollarized economy for 14 years, we have a fixed exchange rate. As a consequence, we cannot use monetary policy as a means of generating competitiveness in the way that many other countries can. This affects our trade balance, which is why we are focusing on projects like the Pacific Refinery. We subsidize petroleum in Ecuador, which we see as part of a social transfer, but it is increasingly expensive for the country, and worsens our trade balance. We have improved the quality of life for people in Ecuador, but this has also contributed to increased consumption, which means a further increase in imports of the kinds of goods and appliances people want for their homes and daily lives. Now, our goal is to change our economic structure in Ecuador to help ensure the competitiveness of the economy and generate more wealth and opportunities for Ecuadoreans. We have traditionally been an exporter of non-value-added products, such as petroleum and agricultural goods. We need to make the leap to industrialization and Buen Vivir, while keeping in mind the protection of our environment. We are dependent on primary exports, and need to step beyond this dependence. This is why we have proposed the strategy for the change of the productive matrix.</p><h4>What does the transformation of the productive matrix mean, more practically, for the economy?</h4><p>The first step is to develop industrializing industries, that is to say, the primary industries that can spur further industrialization in other sectors. These are industries, such as petrochemicals, iron and steel, copper, aluminum, and shipbuilding, among others. The growth of these industries can allow us to overcome our dependence on primary exports. Other countries, such as China, South Korea, and Singapore, have made this transition in the past, but we cannot take the same amount of time that they did to realize the transition. We need to accelerate this process and will invest in this with financing and strategic alliances with friendly nations. I have visited a number of our allies to discuss this, such as India, China, and Cuba. All of this comes down to strengthening national productivity on all levels, from micro-enterprises to large-scale industries and projects.</p><h4>What role can the agricultural sector play in this transformation?</h4><p>Agriculture will remain an important part of our economy. We need to increase productivity per hectare for our agricultural products, such as bananas. Moreover, whatever we produce in the agriculture sector, it is important that we produce much more in the agro-industrial sector as our neighboring countries do. We have defined quality standards for our national products, so that their quality can be recognized not only locally, but also internationally. More generally, the idea is that we need to look not at individual products, but at value chains in order to determine what components can generate the most profit. This will mean greater revenues for producers, allowing Ecuador to move up the value chain. Ecuador is proud to produce the best cocoa in the world. But a kilogram of chocolate sells for much more than a kilogram of cocoa. We can use technology and innovation to make the most of our agricultural strength.</p><h4>How does regional integration fit into this strategy?</h4><p>We have identified that integration as an important part of this, not only in terms of political integration, but also in terms of building regional value chains. Specifically, we are looking at the integration of our energy systems and how this can be used for economic development. We recently signed an agreement with the Ministry of Energy of Chile. Ecuador will soon have an abundance of renewable energy from the eight new hydroelectric projects set for completion by 2016. This is the energy we need to sustain our development and industrialization. Looking at regional value chains, Ecuador has proposed the construction of a copper refinery. Chile and Peru export copper concentrate, but refined copper is a much more preferable export. The refining of copper involves significant energy consumption, and Ecuador will shortly have a substantial supply of environmentally friendly electricity. This is energy that can also be used, for example, for the aluminum industry, another industry that could play an important role in industrializing the country.</p><h4>What role can private international investment play in transforming the productive matrix?</h4><p>The main protagonist in this transformation is the private sector. We have decided to invest here because it is not feasible to await private sector commitment. My country lost decades though neoliberal policies that shaped our economy and lives. Much of the private sector's investment of that time, in the energy sector for example, was costly and inefficient. These plans represent $10 billion of investment and imply many opportunities for investment for the private sector. We have seen considerable interest from investors in countries such as Russia and the Middle East, as well as opportunities to obtain both financing and expertise from other friends, such as China and Brazil, and a few European countries interested in becoming a part of the development of these new industries. Now, here in the Vice-Presidency, we receive international investors from all over the world who are interested in the opportunities that are presented by the productive matrix strategy. These include technology providers, financial institutions, and strategic partners, all of whom are waiting for us to finalize studies in many of these investment areas. At the Vice-Presidency we are working to promote investment, and seeking the technology to transform our economy. Our goal is to ensure that the private sector has the financing and the human talent available to make the necessary investments. That is why Ecuador ranks among the highest-level countries regarding investment in education as a percentage of GDP.</p><h4>How would you characterize the importance of the trade agreement with the EU?</h4><p>This agreement represents opportunities not only for our current exports, but also for export growth across new segments. The important consideration is exports with value-added. This trade agreement will allow us to export everything that represents the new industries that we are building in this country. Ecuador went into this negotiation with a number of clearly defined red lines in terms of public policy, tax policy, public procurement, and strategic areas of the economy to protect. Ultimately, I think we have achieved our objectives. The agreement has yet to be ratified in Ecuador, and during negotiations we have not lost sight of our dollarized economy. We are unable to devalue our currency to generate competitiveness, and, therefore, need to ensure no loss of competitiveness upon signing.</p><h4>What makes Ecuador an attractive destination for international investment?</h4><p>The intensity of our development objectives and our plan to industrialize the economy in the timeframe we are talking about, and with the conditions that we have already created in Ecuador, is something unique. During our time in government we have provided energy, infrastructure, roads, ports, and we have the backing of our citizens. We are proposing $10 billion in investment in basic industries, not including projects like the Pacific Refinery, or our hydroelectric, or infrastructure projects. Ecuador represents opportunities because of its geographic position, and because of its natural resources.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>My recent visit to Ecuador, without a doubt, was extremely significant, considering that it has been 10 years since a Mexican President last visited that nation. It was therefore, a great honor to visit our sister republic in order to reaffirm the desire of both governments to deepen our relationship. A relationship that can hopefully serve as a basis for cooperation, trade, the strengthening of our economies, an increased flow of citizens between the two countries, and above all, of sharing diverse experiences of success, which can allow us to truly strengthen the development of our peoples and prepare them to be part of the demanding and competitive globalized world.<br></p><p>During my visit to Ecuador, President Correa and I expressed the desire of both governments to work towards all goals agreed upon in various memorandums of understanding and agreements, in cooperation and collaboration toward a range of objectives. Our target is a broadening of our commercial relations in order to achieve a greater equilibrium in the trade balance between the two countries and to secure the strong support and cooperation of our countries' educational institutions with the Yachay City of Knowledge.</p><p>Additionally, we aim to build the technical cooperation of the Mexican Federal Electricity Commission with electrical generation projects being developed in Ecuador. We also agreed to create a worthy space for the headquarters of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which could not boast a grander headquarters, and which has the potential to become a cultural space delegated to the Cultural Economic Fund, which fosters still closer cultural links between Ecuador and Mexico.</p><p>The goals that President Correa and I agreed on during my visit are more than good intentions; they are real objectives for our two countries. Beyond discussing our mutual relations, we have set tangible goals that can bring real benefits and results for the harmonious relationship between our two countries. In Mexico, we have been working to rise above the fundamental challenges that the world is facing. We have pushed forward structural reforms to energize our economy and to achieve better economic performance on which to base social development for the inhabitants of our country. Ecuador, without a doubt, has been doing the same.</p><p>Ecuador has seen sustained economic growth over recent years, having promoted inspirational social policies that are, without a doubt, reaching segments of the population that previously had no support. Mexico is doing the same. What we are doing in Mexico is very similar to what Ecuador is trying to achieve. Mexico, and the administration which I have the honor to lead, has set five main national goals, oriented at national security. As a result, today we see a Mexican State of greater capacity and strength. We have detained many high profile individuals from various criminal organizations precisely because we have been strengthening the capacity of the Mexican government through greater coordination between different levels of government.</p><p>Another major objective that we share with Ecuador is education. We cannot hope to be a more developed society with greater opportunities for our people if we cannot spark greater abilities and capacities among new generations. As such, Mexico is pushing forward education reform, not only to achieve wider coverage, but more importantly to improve the quality of education being provided.</p><p>We have worked toward making Mexico more inclusive, through different social programs, and without a doubt, those that Ecuador has implemented have become a key benchmark for what we can achieve through the social policies that our government is implementing in Mexico. A prosperous Mexico, which is our goal in assuring that Mexico grows economically and sustainably, can provide conditions for enhanced development. This, again, is an objective that we wholeheartedly share with Ecuador.</p><p>A further goal is to transform Mexico into a responsible global actor. It was for precisely this reason that I visited Ecuador earlier in 2014. Primarily, to reaffirm Mexico's Latin American identity, and then to reaffirm the links of brotherhood and respect that Mexico has, and maintains, with all of the people of the Latin American region. I believe that we have successfully conveyed this sentiment on many platforms and forums.</p><p>I therefore pledge that the goals that President Correa and I set out during my visit will be realized to the fullest extent, helping to strengthen and broaden the relationship of affection and brotherhood between Ecuador and Mexico.</p><p>Extracted from a speech given following the visit of President Nieto to Ecuador on March 10, 2014.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Upon President Rafael Correa's visit to Spain last April, he stated that relations between Ecuador and Spain were experiencing an “extraordinary moment." How would you assess the relations between both nations, what is your vision for the future of Spanish-Ecuadorean relations and what areas have more potential for growth?<br></h4><p>I agree with President Correa and thank him greatly for valuing so positively the state of our bilateral relations. President Correa is the second Latin American president I welcomed in the Moncloa Palace, just four months after starting my mandate, in March 2012. I remember well our first meeting. Beyond ideology, we agreed on the essential, on the need to apply, above all, common sense, taking into account the circumstances of the moment and what is more convenient for citizens. Ever since then we have had a special understanding. We had bilateral meetings on a total of four occasions. President Correa is, with Colombian President Santos, the Latin American President with whom I have met the most. The last visit of President Correa was especially pleasing. He came to receive an honorary doctorate from the Universidad Autonoma de Barcelona and used his visit to drive forward the priority of his third term: human talent, science and technology.</p><p>President Correa knows that Spain is always ready to provide Ecuador with all the cooperation it may need, as he could see for himself during his visits to the Institute of Marine Sciences in Barcelona, and Biomedical Research Park in Madrid. Ecuador is enjoying a great period of political stability and economical growth. The country is developing infrastructure projects that will improve competitiveness and productivity, and especially the life quality of its citizens. Projects such as Quito's metro and Cuenca's tram are concrete examples, but there are many more. With the recent accession of Ecuador to the Multiparty Trade Agreement of the European Union with Colombia and Peru, our trade relations and investment flows in both directions will receive a significant boost. Therefore, our relations are meant to be even more intense in all fields, but particularly in the economic and talent mobility.</p><h4>Ecuadoreans represent the main Latin American community in Spain. How do you assess the integration of Ecuadoreans in Spain?</h4><p>As I said in my press conference with President Correa the first time I had the pleasure to meet him at the Moncloa Palace, relations between Spain and Ecuador are special because people are our greatest asset. The human factor is always the most enriching and the element we must look after the most in bilateral relations between countries. Ecuador and Spain are setting a good example to the world by their orderly, legal and mutual integration migration flows. In Spain we have the second largest Ecuadorean community abroad, which is here the first Latin American community: more than 400,000 Ecuadoreans live in Spain, and many more if you count dual nationals.</p><p>Almost 40% of Ecuadoreans who emigrated from Ecuador to Spain have received Spanish nationality without losing their Ecuadorean nationality. Since 2000, more than 260,000 Ecuadoreans have obtained Spanish citizenship through residence. All Spaniards are truly grateful for the contribution of Ecuadoreans to our development and the fact that they choose Spain as their second home it is a matter of great pride for us. I want to emphasize that Ecuadoreans are integrated into our society with a commendable sense of solidarity, sharing our values and even fighting for freedom in the most difficult missions of our Armed Forces. Estalyn Angelo Mera, who died in combat in Afghanistan, is an example of Ecuadorean heroism, sacrifice, and values. His Majesty the King awarded him the Cross of Military Merit with Red Badge, an extraordinary distinction. I would like these pages to be a homage of them all, paying them, again, all our tributes, recognition, admiration, and respect.</p><h4>How does Spain evaluate Ecuador's adhesion to the Multiparty Trade Agreement of the EU with Colombia and Peru, and where does Spain stand in the elimination of the Schengen visa for Ecuadorean nationals?</h4><p>I am extremely pleased with the accession of Ecuador to the Multiparty Trade Agreement of the European Union with Colombia and Peru. We must congratulate President Correa for this decision. He gave an example of pragmatism and political realism. A good leader is one who makes decisions based on what is best for his citizens on the long-term, not letting his ideology limit them. By becoming a middle-income country, in 2015 Ecuador will not be able to benefit from the Generalized System of Preferences of the European Union, losing the benefits of market access with zero (or very low) custom tariffs.</p><p>Therefore, Ecuadorean exports would have to start paying custom tariffs if it wasn't for the fact that Ecuador has joined the Multiparty Trade Agreement. Without this privileged access to the EU market, which is the world's largest integrated market, Ecuadorean exports would have lost competitiveness and market shares, for custom duties would have become more expensive. Ecuador would have ended up exporting less, in other words, having less national income and therefore a lower ability to redistribute income. All Ecuadoreans would have lost a lot.</p><p>Thanks to the Multi-Party Trade Agreement, Ecuador goes from a limited system of market access, unilateral and temporary (GSP +), to an improved, bilateral (which takes into account the needs of both parties) and long-term (almost definitive) system.</p><p>In a transitional period of 10 years, Ecuador's exports will have free access to 96.4% of the European Union market, from which significant Ecuadorean products and sectors such as fishing, bananas, flowers, coffee, cocoa, fruits and nuts will benefit. European exports, for the first time, will also improve access to the Ecuadorean market, examples being cars and alcoholic beverages (wines and spirits). However, it is not just about trade. The agreement means, above everything else, that Ecuador enters the list of the most reliable, open and safe countries to invest in, with clear rules. European investment will pay more attention to Ecuador and not only to its neighbors Colombia and Peru. With more exports and more investment, the national income of Ecuador will increase too and therefore the capacity and ability to redistribute this income and thus social cohesion. Ecuadoreans will also directly benefit from the agreement, for they will be eligible to travel to the EU without a visa. The main argument of my Government in asking the European Commission and Member States to withdraw the Schengen visa for Colombia and Peru was the entry into force of the Multiparty Trade Agreement of the EU. I hope that the agreement will soon be signed and ratified, so that with its entry into force we have a new ambition in our relationships. Ecuador can always count on Spain so that the efforts of Ecuadoreans are recognized and its policies of trade liberalization and legal security are rewarded without discrimination. Those are the sound policies the European Union applies and wants for its partners.</p><h4>How do you envision Ecuador's economic future?</h4><p>I am very optimistic. I believe in Ecuador; first of all in the capacity of Ecuadoreans, but also in the country's new political stability and its economic future. The fact that the Ecuadorean government has been pragmatic and has acceded to the Multiparty Trade Agreement of the European Union with Colombia and Peru inspires me with much confidence.</p><p>The figures of our trade and investment flows show that Spanish companies are also increasingly turning to Ecuador. Between 2009 and 2012 Spanish exports to Ecuador increased by 222%, from ‚¬184 million to ‚¬593 million. Spanish investment has also been gradually increasing, from an aggregate of ‚¬742 million in 2010 to ‚¬998 million in 2012, which means an increase of 34%. The crisis has not stopped Spanish investment in Ecuador. It is worth remembering the success of the Hispano-Ecuadorean Business Meeting held in 2012 and closed by the then Prince of Asturias, King Felipe VI today.</p><p>In addition, Ecuador is addressing with ambition the bottlenecks of its economic development, as evidenced by the development of infrastructure and creation of alternative sources of income to oil. Exporting more and with a greater diversification of products and markets, receiving more investment, developing infrastructure, collecting more tax revenue for other complementary policies such as education, science and technology, Ecuador has become an example of change and pragmatism. Ecuador is on the path of progress and as Prime Minister of Spain this gives me great satisfaction. Ecuadoreans deserve this.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Ecuador recently concluded its negotiations for a trade agreement with the EU. What is the significance of the agreement for Ecuador?<br></h4><p>The negotiation of a trade agreement with the EU concluded in July 2014, after nine rounds of negotiations from bloc to bloc. The process started in 2007 together with the Andean Community countries. The result of this process is an agreement that meets the needs of Ecuador in relation to access to the European market and the protection of sensitive domestic production sectors. Ecuador requested special and differential treatment due to the size differences of the economies; Ecuador is more vulnerable to international prices due to its dollarized economy. Undoubtedly, the negotiations represent a win-win scenario.</p><h4>Do you feel that the EU has been receptive to providing special and differential treatment, which acknowledges the different challenges Ecuador will face?</h4><p>We feel the EU has been receptive; however, its first option was to negotiate an association agreement. In addition to bilateral trade talks, the EU also maintains agreements between specific trade blocs and, as such, negotiations for an agreement between the EU and the Andean Community was initially proposed. Unfortunately, due to the fact that we could not carry out this negotiation in a mutual manner as a bloc, Ecuador decided to continue unilaterally. The primary objective is still the same; however, this agreement deals not only with trade, but development in general, as well as helping regional economies and creating welfare.</p><h4>Do you see it as something positive that Ecuador is negotiating an agreement on its own rather than as part of a bloc?</h4><p>Every bloc negotiation has its positive and negative aspects. When you secure a trade deal as a single country, it is adapted to meet the specific needs of that state. As a bloc, the interests of some countries are sacrificed for the good of the group. On the other hand, it is notably better to negotiate as a bloc, because you have more power and influence in the negotiation process. In that respect, during these negotiations, we have certainly gained in terms of certain specific interests for Ecuador, but we have also lost some negotiating capacity.</p><h4>What is the current importance of trade with the Middle East, and specifically the UAE, and what role do you see it playing in the future?</h4><p>Currently, our trade with the Middle East is not very significant. However, the importance of this region lies in its potential for greater opportunities. The Middle East has enormous consumer capacity, especially in regard to our products, and there is a significant market demand in this region for high-quality products, which Ecuador can provide. The market demand for food exports is particularly high, due to the lack of capacity that many Middle Eastern countries have to grow local crops. Countries like Ecuador can provide high-quality food products, year-round. There is also huge immediate potential for Middle Eastern countries to invest in Ecuador, as the country provides a strong, structured option for countries seeking to diversify their risks following the financial crisis, which made a significant impact on much of the Western world. Ecuador can fill this portfolio gap, primarily because of its political, economic, and social stability. The country has developed interesting high-value projects in both the public and private arenas. We are working to incentivize countries like Qatar, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia to invest in Ecuador's energy, physical infrastructure, telecommunications, food, and industrial sectors. It is also worth mentioning that Ecuador is looking to utilize the city of Dubai as its main economic hub for the Middle East and nearby regions, such as Africa and India.</p><h4>How is Ecuador responding to the suspension of preferential access to the US trade market?</h4><p>The US market will remain a crucial partner for Ecuador, and we are keen to increase investment opportunities between the two countries. Ecuador has opened four trade offices in the US located in New York, Miami, Chicago, and Los Angeles, and the country is looking to open another office in Houston, in 2015. The possibility of negotiating a trade agreement with the US does exist, and Ecuador has a significant interest in this; I made this point quite clear in meetings with the US government in 2013. The real question lies in what type of agreement this will be. In our previous experience negotiating with the US, we found that many times the asymmetries between itself and its negotiating partners are not properly taken into account. It negotiates as if other countries are on the same level, which is unacceptable. If the US is willing to take Ecuador's unique economic situation into account, then negotiating a new trade agreement could be an option.</p><h4>How will the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) affect Ecuador, considering that the country is not participating?</h4><p>Ecuador is well aware that the Asia-Pacific region is the most important area in the world today. It is also the most strategic, because the countries that will exhibit the highest growth rates in the coming years are found in this region. Ecuador is also a part of the Pacific Rim and, as such, participation in any process related to developing economic trade in this region is important for the country. We are examining whether we should integrate ourselves into Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), an organization that helps to create a type of economic synergy among regional actors. However, for the moment, we have decided not to officially take part in this forum primarily because, from a trade perspective, the region is too liberal. This does not mean we aren't keeping up with what is happening with this mechanism, in fact, we may seek to become part of this agreement in the future. If the TPP comes into force, Ecuador will re-evaluate its role in this forum; however, I am not optimistic about the outcome because interests are quite varied at this moment.</p><h4>What are your key priorities for Ecuador's trade policy over the coming years?</h4><p>We hope that the conclusion of the agreement with the EU will help our country close other pending deals and lead to negotiations for agreements with Canada, the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), Turkey, and South Korea. In Latin America, we are in the process of finishing negotiations with El Salvador and Nicaragua, and are commencing negotiations with the Dominican Republic and Honduras. We also hope to reach a more comprehensive agreement with Mexico in the near future, and we are working to finalize and sign an agreement with Venezuela in 2015. Ecuador is also launching a powerful campaign next year to improve the country's image by promoting various sectors, including tuna, shrimp, and flowers. We want to boost our exports in terms of both value and volume; however, this requires a change in our export tendencies. Finally, our goal is to increase foreign investment into the country.</p><h4>The past few years have not been positive in terms of multilateralism in world trade. Is the future of international trade going to be in bilateral agreements?</h4><p>The position of the Ecuadorean government is that multilateralism is the best option. We believe in the WTO and its purpose. Unfortunately, the reality is that it is extremely difficult to reach result-oriented agreements in the WTO. The last meeting in Bali was more successful than Doha in reaching certain trade agreements, but was still not sufficient.</p><h4>What role should international trade play in developing the Ecuadorean economy?</h4><p>The role of international trade is essential in developing the economy. When you have a dollarized economy, there are only three ways of bringing in currency: debt, foreign investment, and exports.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-city-on-the-rise]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As you begin your term as the Mayor of Quito, what do you see as the biggest challenges facing the city?<br></h4><p>One major challenge is improving our citizens' quality of life. This involves a number of things: improving mobility, transportation, and traffic, which is a major problem here in Quito. The other is competitiveness. We believe that Quito's potential competitiveness has not been taken advantage of in the past. This is because the previous administration believed the municipality had to do everything on its own, and regarded the private sector with skepticism. We believe that the private sector should generate wealth and employment, and that the municipality should be a partner in achieving these goals. In order for this to happen, we need to establish a clear and solid rule of law. This will create an environment that fosters entrepreneurship, local and foreign investment, and industrial areas with clear rules where new businesses can develop.</p><h4>To what extent does a local government actually have the power to facilitate such economic developments?</h4><p>Local governments have many tools at their disposal. Many industries have been leaving Quito for neighboring cities in Ecuador, which shows that the problem is on a city level. If you compare the investment coming into Quito with other cities in the country, you can see that we have been losing our position over the past few years. Investment is stagnating because local taxes in Quito are up to six times higher than in Guayaquil and Cuenca. Our response will be to reduce local taxes for the lower and middle classes. That will also create a much friendlier environment for entrepreneurship and investment. We are also eliminating bureaucracy and red tape, municipal licenses, and permits required to operate a business in the city. In the past, red tape prevented many new businesses from setting up in Quito, and these are steps we can take on a local level to stimulate growth and investment. We must establish a clear set of rules regarding land use. Establishing specific areas within the city for industrial development and applying the right kind of incentives for industry in such areas will foster competition and investment. We have also identified three main economic areas in which we see significant potential for Quito in the future.</p><p>The first is tourism, which Quito has an innate potential for developing. Quito was designated as UNESCO's first world-heritage city in 1978. We have also won the World Travel Awards for the best South American Touristic Destination two years in a row. Quito is also one of the 21 semi-finalists for the seven new wonders of the world process. All these factors have been useful in terms of promotion. Quito now receives 630,000 tourists per year, and we are hoping to double that number during my term. We are already establishing incentives for more investments in tourism such as hotel projects and programs that foster tourist activity.</p><p>The second area we have identified as strategic is our logistics export activity around the new airport. The airport is located in rural Quito. The location is quite isolated, so there is potential for development around the airport with a focus on logistical and export-related activity. Thirdly, we want to develop the economy of creativity and technological development. We are working on a new innovation district in Quito with professionals from MIT. These are the same people who developed the innovation districts for Medellí­n, Barcelona, Singapore, and other cities around the world. There is great potential in this arena because young professionals will take Quito into the future. We will advance not only by leveraging software and technological development, but also through innovative solutions to everyday urban problems.  So, in these three economic areas, we have created specific tools to foster entrepreneurship and drive foreign and local investment.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the government's strategy to ensure that public investment translates into sustainable development?<br></h4><p>The goal of our government is to promote a change in how the country produces goods and services. We want to change the country from being mainly a primary goods producer to one that has a significant industrial and services sector. In 2013, Ecuador's economy grew by 4.5%, and over the past four years it has recorded average growth rates of 5.2%. This is quite stable, not just for Latin America, but globally. But more importantly, the manufacturing sector and the non-oil economy grew considerably. The non-oil sector has grown by 5.8% since the world economic crisis of 2010. Our aim is to transform Ecuador into a non-oil and knowledge-based economy, although it remains in need of generating foreign exchange. These foreign exchange revenues are being used to promote a different growth and development pattern. Public investment has to underpin a basic infrastructure that allows the non-oil industries to shift their costs to become more profitable. This has been happening heavily over the past five or six years. This is because, from a cost structure perspective, it would not be possible to bring about the changes needed solely through private initiatives. The government must provide the infrastructure, roads, electricity, education, healthcare, and higher education. These are all crucial to changing the relative costs of industry over time. Today, all non-oil sectors are growing faster than in the past, in a highly stable economy. Ecuador has solid growth, low inflation and unemployment, stable interest rates, and increasing human talent, all conducive to private sector investment. We do have a current account deficit, since we are investing and importing raw materials and capital goods to support production and these investments, but the current account deficit is still only 1.3% of GDP, which is quite manageable. Our financial system is also stable. We have the highest liquidity rates in our history since becoming a dollarized economy, having increased from 29% in 2009 to 37% in 2013.</p><h4>Concerning dollarization, do you have concerns that you are using a currency over which you have no control, while at the same time engaging in high levels of public investment?</h4><p>This concern explains why we place great importance on stability and responsibility, and accounting for every dollar. As we lack a national currency, each US dollar that goes out means less money to fund Ecuadorean growth, while each US dollar that comes into the country promotes growth, spurring greater investment opportunities and aiding the financial system in general. Three years ago new policies allowed us to control the volume of money in the economy, helping to attract money to Ecuador. In the past it was common for bankers and citizens to save money abroad. Our new policies make it more attractive to keep their money here. This has increased liquidity in the economy, which encourages further investment. Credit policies are also important, be it via the private or public banking sector. Total credit increased from 20.3% of GDP to 28%. In nominal amounts, credit growth has been at 109% over the past five years, while private credit rates have grown by 92%, and the public banking figures are at 356%. We have followed a deliberate policy of increasing credit to keep the country going and the economy running smoothly. In 2013, FDI accounted for 0.8% of GDP, or $702 million, which many consider low, although FDI in Ecuador is a net provider of foreign exchange, and those rates are still the highest Ecuador has seen in the past five years.</p><h4>What are your key priorities for the BCE over the coming years?</h4><p>Providing sufficient liquidity for the economy and making sure it stays stable with an adequate growth rate for credit, and making sure loans are repaid are all key priorities for us. We also have to be careful about spending quality, as we are obviously trying to make sure we have a net increase in the amount of money coming in.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role do Seguros Sucre and Seguros Rocafuerte play in Ecuador's insurance sector?<br></h4><p>Today, there are two state-owned insurance companies in the industry, Seguros Sucre and Seguros Rocafuerte, and we both currently work to ensure that the entire public sector is insured. Both companies are led by two highly experienced professionals, who have both worked in the insurance sector for over 25 years. These are two key elements for both the sector and the state. All in all, it is important for the government to have a state-owned insurance company in order to protect its vast public structure and insure its properties.</p><h4>How would you characterize the insurance market in Ecuador?</h4><p>Today, the sector is gaining relevance, experiencing the growth and expansion we all expect. However, Ecuadoreans are not yet fully culturally aware of the importance of insurance coverage. This is something we all need to work on in the industry. At the moment, there are around 40 insurance companies operating in Ecuador, and they will all need to fulfill the requirements of being stronger in terms of capital adequacy and equity, as stipulated by the government.</p><h4>What is required to increase the social penetration of insurance products?</h4><p>We need high levels of innovation and hard work with products for the mass consumer segment. Also, insurance companies must be creative enough to develop new products and strategies to target alternative market niches. Ecuador lags behind in terms of premium level and share of GDP, or in other words, the penetration of the insurance sector in society, as compared to other regional countries like Colombia, Chile, and Costa Rica is lower. This difference is mainly related to the way each country has developed its insurance industry—Ecuador has definitely not developed its insurance sector as far as the aforementioned countries.</p><h4>Looking forward, what are the greatest challenges facing Ecuador's insurance industry?</h4><p>We have to be able to increase our penetration, culturally educate people in the importance of insurance products, and also increase our share and role in the national economy. I think the greatest challenge by far is to increase the share of the insurance sector in GDP. However, let me say that over the past few years we have received more foreign investment in the sector—today, numerous multinationals operate in the industry, and I believe we are in the process in which local players must become more competitive to survive and as the level of professionalism increases, so too does the awareness among people of the need for insurance.</p><h4>What is the balance between public and private companies in your client portfolio?</h4><p>Around 80% to 85% of our client portfolio is composed of public entities. In this context, one of our main challenges is to become more competitive and transparent in order to better target the private sector in the near future.</p><h4>What are your goals looking ahead?</h4><p>Seguros Sucre is the leading insurance company in Ecuador, whereas Seguros Rocafuerte is among the top 10. Our goal is to consolidate the operations of both companies in order to increase our solidity and reliability, which will enable us to increase our share of the market. Also, we need to increase the number of services offered to our clients. These two elements will enable us to become a more relevant player in the private sector. If we want to increase our reliability in consumer perception, we must become a more transparent company. In this context, we have already taken important steps toward achieving this; we have traveled abroad with our largest clients when negotiating their reinsurance contracts, so they can be part of the entire process, knowing exactly where we stand at each particular moment.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the role of Petroecuador in Ecuador's efforts to transform the energy and production matrices?<br></h4><p>We play a key role within the energy sector, as part of the decision-making process, and  we provide advice on the business to the public authorities. Ecuador currently imports large volumes of diesel for power generation. Once projects like the Pacific Refinery, in which we also play a substantial role, are on course, Ecuador will become self-sufficient in diesel for its industrial needs. We are also involved in efforts to change consumption patterns in terms of electricity and gas, areas in which Petroecuador also has several projects. We also have close ties with other economic sectors to better assess their fuel needs. Petroecuador not only produces fuels, but also many other products such as asphalt, an essential element in the large infrastructure projects the country is set to implement. Again, we have close ties with public authorities and the relevant ministries in order to better orientate our projects and business activity toward the main objectives of the government.</p><h4>What analysis has the company made in terms of producing and marketing alternative fuels such as ethanol and biodiesel?</h4><p>We have conducted technical analyses and studies in order to start biodiesel production. Technically speaking, we are ready to produce biodiesel, but this is not a decision we can take unilaterally, as it also requires infrastructure such as service stations, and the vehicles need to be prepared for this type of fuel. Currently, Ecuador produces palm oil, which is transformed into biodiesel, and so far there is just one biodiesel producer in the country. However, a tariff scheme has to be set up. In the meantime, we already produce several types of fuel such as fuel with ethanol. Over the final months of 2014, we will be providing this type of fuel to all of the Guayaquil city area and we plan to expand nationwide. I should also note that for us to fully cover the Ecuadorean territory with such fuels, we require substantial sugar cane production.</p><h4>How has the restructuring of Petroecuador made the company more efficient?</h4><p>This restructuring, which also involved Petroamazonas, took place a year and a half ago. It has been a positive decision for both companies. Before, there were two companies engaging in duplicate activities: production and exploration. The restructuring implied greater efficiency and more synergies. Petroamazonas has increased production and we have a stronger focus on the activities we do, namely, refining, logistics, distribution, and supply of hydrocarbons.</p><h4>How important is the Pacific Refinery project for the national economy?</h4><p>Ecuador produces 550,000 bbl/d of crude oil and the national refining capacity only reaches 175,000 bbl/d. The remaining production is exported, and we import industrialized products such as diesel, gasoline, and LPG. One should bear in mind that the gap between exported oil and imported products is significant. We have a strong dependence on fuel imports. The Pacific Refinery will redress this situation, augmenting the economy and boosting development of the whole country. This refinery will also help us to improve the quality of our fuels. It should become fully operative within five years, as key steps have been taken over the past few months. Our company and the country itself are making large investments in infrastructure and other projects such as the storage and transporting of LPG. We also have ambitious projects regarding the storage and handling of diesel and gasoline, as well as petrochemicals, including several key pipelines and oil distribution centers. We have invested in the latter areas over the past few years to make our infrastructure more efficient. We are also modernizing and making much more efficient use of infrastructure at the Esmeraldas Refinery. At this facility investment is exceeding $1 billion.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What differentiates Sertecpet in an industry dominated by foreign players?<br></h4><p>Sertecpet's principle characteristic over its 23 years of history is innovation; we have developed technologies and services that are patented and internationally certified. Additionally, the value our company generates with its products and services allows us to stand apart. Our integrated solutions are efficient and profitable, and today our clients consider us partners, rather than contractors. These features have enabled us to internationalize our services and products, and are the basis of our success.</p><h4>What challenges have you faced as an Ecuadorean business expanding internationally?</h4><p>Our company has operated in the industry for the past 23 years; however, the real technological and innovative development of Sertecpet has taken place over the past 14 years. It is not easy for a company from a small country to sell its products and services abroad, especially in our industry, which hosts large and highly experienced players. Our company has lowered these barriers, confirming that not only large countries and multinationals create technology and generate value-added for other companies. We have demonstrated that Ecuadorean expertise is as valuable as any other, registering our own R&amp;D advances. We have always had a clear market niche; mature and low production oil fields, where our solutions boost efficiency and competitiveness. For example, we have taken 15 closed fields from PEMEX to a current production level of around 6,700 bbl/day.</p><p>Initially, we focused our strategic plan on the Middle East, but socio-political turbulence prompted a shift to the American continent, today our key focus. Our aim is to consolidate regional operations from Alaska to Patagonia by 2020. We also plan to widen our area of activity to both non-renewable and renewable energy. Overall, we have a more global and integrated strategic plan for the near future based, again, on our know-how, technologies, and capacity to reach new levels.</p><h4>How can Ecuador sustain its impressive social and economic development?</h4><p>I believe that the public and private sectors, as well as the education sector—with emphasis on tertiary education—should together analyze national needs for the public good. I think this is essential to achieving the much desired change in the production matrix—establishing the role of each sector in the process. Sertecpet is an exemplar in terms of commitment to R&amp;D and innovation, underpinned by an Ecuadorean workforce and registering great success abroad. Today, we are talking about an organization of 1,800 staff, which makes a tangible economic contribution.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the energy sector?</h4><p>Ecuador has a suitable regulatory framework and the resources to boost the development of solar energy projects over the coming years; it also has the potential to double current production figures, and will increase hydro-electric energy generation in the short term through ongoing projects. Overall, the country is well placed to become a regional energy exporter. Ongoing energy projects will reduce costs and boost industrial competitiveness. In this context, Sertecpet has quite a role to play in Ecuador, but also regionally. We will continue investing in R&amp;D and rely on innovation to generate value-added, forging strategic alliances with local and foreign players, and contributing to the development of Ecuador and any other market we operate in. Having said that, our goal is to consolidate our activities on the entire American continent, requiring important changes to include corporate governance and listing requirements.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You became the head of LAN Ecuador at the beginning of 2013. What has been your perception of Ecuador's airline sector?<br></h4><p>The airline sector is very modern featuring the latest generation aircraft, which is not typical of many airlines in South America. It is an industry that has high standards in terms of safety and airport infrastructure. It is a dynamic market because of the country's geography, which makes it very decentralized. The size of the market is also large considering the size of the country and the per-capita level of travel is very high. There is a culture of air travel in Ecuador because the corporate sector is used to high-frequency travel. They demand fast and high-quality service, which makes the market very fluid.</p><h4>How does that compare to the last market you worked in, Peru?</h4><p>Peru was much more centralized with domestic traffic flying through Lima, and much less traffic between other cities. In Ecuador, there is a higher rate of flights in the corporate sector. The new airport in Quito is somewhat farther from the city, so people plan their trips more. A lot of people just get on a plane to have lunch with their client, and then return to the office in the afternoon. People are used to the flexibility of commuting between cities.</p><h4>What does good service from an airline mean to you?</h4><p>Good service is a combination of attributes: modern airplanes, proper maintenance, scheduling, and rigorous training standards. We have also worked hard to enhance cooperation with the authorities, the government, the airports, and our suppliers. In Quito for example, there is an issue with turbulence during the summer due to the mountains situated near the landing path. We found out that most of the turbulence comes from a certain area, and is caused by volcanic activity and air rising from the Amazon, so we mapped out a different route. This change has reduced the number of canceled flights at Quito airport by 20%-30%. We also worked with the Quito airport to make an alternate plan to land from north to south because sometimes the wind changes direction. We have also improved efficiency with a larger runway. The old airport was at a much higher altitude, and required more distance for take off, while the new airport is built at a lower elevation making it more efficient and safer.</p><h4>LAN is also working with the Fundación Municipal de Turismo para Cuenca. What is the significance of that for your operations in Ecuador?</h4><p>Our business depends on tourism, and we work closely with the tourism authorities, with Quito Turismo, and the Ministry of Tourism, with whom we recently signed an agreement to promote Ecuador. We are trying to promote more international and Ecuadorean travel. We work with the Ministry of Tourism on marketing campaigns to bring in tour operators and to learn how to promote Ecuador through training and education. We also work with tour operators internationally for very specific marketing campaigns. We have quotas for certain places, like Barcelona and have sales teams all over the world.</p><h4>How much of your business is in cargo here?</h4><p>Cargo represents about 25% of our business, and the growth of the flower sector has played a large part. Ecuador has become one of the world's greatest exporters of roses. Growers here have introduced many new varieties that have attracted new consumers, and opened up fresh markets. Ecuadorean flowers are in high demand in Eastern Europe and Russia.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the number one mission of PRO ECUADOR?<br></h4><p>PRO ECUADOR, in reality, has two main objectives. One is the promotion of our consolidated export offer, and we also play a role in the promotion of new value-added products from the country. A second goal is the attraction of investment to Ecuador.</p><h4>What kind of support does PRO ECUADOR provide for exporters?</h4><p>One of the main features of PRO ECUADOR is the fact that we have 32 business offices around the world, working in about 1,000 activities related to the promotion of exports and investments in any given year. That means that every day, we have at least three or four activities going on somewhere in the world. I consider it vital that we offer the export sector such global promotion. We also have several tools that can be used in the promotion of Ecuadorean goods to the world, and these tools are basically designed in relation to each country where we have a presence. This strategy has been designed simply because we have different degrees of commercial relations with different countries. We can basically divide our consumer markets or targets into three groups: the countries with which we are just beginning to develop relations, those where we are at an intermediate stage, and those in which we enjoy fully developed commercial relations.</p><h4>How do your export promotion strategies differ by market type?</h4><p>There are two basic kinds of strategies supported by different tools or activities. We have image creation tools and sales development tools. They are related to the specific kind of activities we do in any of those markets. In a market that in which we are just beginning commercial relations, like Turkey for example, we mostly do image development activities. In intermediate markets, we do a mixture of image creation and sales development. In fully developed markets, we basically concentrate our activities and strategies on implementing incremental export sales from Ecuador. We also have more specific tools that are developed to help SMEs and major companies.</p><h4>What would you say are the challenges for Ecuadorean companies looking to export?</h4><p>We try to identify “complementary production platforms" in order to do business with them, because we produce what they don't. A company's first strategy should be to identify sectors in which it does not compete with that country. The same applies to the goods that we produce. In that sense, we rely heavily on the help that we get through our international officenetwork, which provides the cure strategic intelligence used in entering those markets. Another challenge that companies face is fostering an export culture to begin with.</p><h4>What are the key areas in which Ecuador should be promoting investment?</h4><p>I guess one of the main concerns of the government has been to develop Ecuador as a modern society and robust state. I do not know of any developed country that has achieved that stage, unless they have developed three basic areas: a solid infrastructure, a healthcare system capable of satisfying the population, and also a quality educational system. Those objectives are the main concerns of our government; we are working on achieving them to propel Ecuador into the future. I was recently contacted by a large foreign investor who said that they had selected Ecuador over another Latin American country because we have better highway infrastructure. We have chosen the right path to develop the Ecuador of the future. For the first time, this government knows exactly what we have to do and how to support the projection of our exports around the world. PRO ECUADOR is an example of that. We have only been here for three years, but we have opened up the world to Ecuadorean exports as never before.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of Ecuador's trade with the US?<br></h4><p>For Ecuador, close to 50% of exports are bound for the US, which is in turn one of the main suppliers for Ecuador. There are many US companies present in Ecuador, involved in production, trade, and sales, and re-exporting from Ecuador. This is particularly important for the banana industry. Bananas are exported by large US multinationals to markets such as Europe, Turkey, and even New Zealand. These companies play a vital role in our economy, and we enjoy excellent business relations with the US, despite a certain tension in the past arising from our diplomatic support for WikiLeaks. The private sector has remained robust despite these issues, and we liaise with ambassadors and officials so that private contacts have been able to sustain bilateral relations. Our combined trade of almost $19 billion is set to increase, while our population is 15 million, which means that for almost every person there is close to 20% of GNP per capita with the US. It is vital to keep trade flowing and pursue more markets. It will take a while for some to realize that these bilateral relations are crucial not only for businesses, but also for individuals, as almost 10% of the population lives abroad, with most residing in the US.</p><h4>Should it be a priority for the government to renegotiate a bilateral agreement?</h4><p>It is arguably ill-advised to reach an agreement with a nation that is much larger than yourself as you run the risk of asymmetrical trade. The counter argument is that it is good to partner with a large country in that it can open the door to large investment possibilities. The government is looking into an ideological agreement that deals with the difficulties of a bilateral agreement with the US, because for us this trade is crucial. Half of our exports are destined for the US, while just a fraction of US exports come here. Also, trade is focused on certain parts of the US. For example, Ecuador is an important trading partner for Florida, but wholly irrelevant to Washington, DC. Meanwhile, Texas exports many products for the oil and gas industry to Ecuador; therefore, it is vital to address diverse perspectives when considering such questions.</p><h4>How would you describe the focus of AMCHAM Quito's work?</h4><p>We work both domestically and internationally, and have taken many Americans who have long worked here to Washington, DC. When businessmen who have worked in a specific area visit the capital, their cases are listened to carefully. For example, when we were lobbying for an extension of the ATPDEA, we lobbied on six separate occasions due to the number of updates. We have authorities here in Ecuador who are trying to impose restrictions, or pass new provisions on intellectual property that will affect new members. Sometimes, we are successful and sometimes we are not, but we do raise issues and then come back and provide other opportunities to move agendas. We are often grouped together with Venezuela, Cuba, and Argentina as anti-trade, but we respond to this by saying that we are not anti-trade and it is a mistake to put us in the wrong group because you lose business opportunities. No matter how much Correa supports Maduro in a speech, if you walk down the street and talk to business owners, general managers, and other people involved in commerce, you get a different view.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Recently, President Correa said that his top goal for Ecuador is to promote social and economic development. What role does the Ministry of Finance play in that?<br></h4><p>First of all, we are a growing economy. Over the past five years, we have grown by an average of 4.2%. In our national development plan, we have two clear objectives. The first is to change the energy matrix, and the second is to develop the productive matrix. My role as the Minister of Finance is to secure the necessary financing to achieve these goals. For example, the plan to change our energy matrix will cost approximately $8 billion. The result of this change will mean that, from 2016, Ecuador will save $1.2 billion annually. This is 1.2% of our GDP. Obviously, to do these major infrastructure projects requires a lot of funding, and our goal is to find the best sources of financing to fund public investment.</p><h4>You recently signed an agreement with the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). What is the significance of that agreement?</h4><p>My responsibility as Minister of Finance is to find the best sources of financing with the best terms from sources all around the world. A few years ago, we negotiated a special agreement with China. However, it's not good for an economy to be reliant on only one creditor. Therefore, we are also looking to Russia, Brazil, and multilateral lenders, such as the Corporación Andina de Fomento (CAF) and the European Investment Bank (EIB). We recently opened a new line of credit with the Abu Dhabi Development Fund. We believe the Ecuadorean development policy should be by Ecuadoreans, for Ecuadoreans. For this reason, we don't accept any conditionality on loans or financing.</p><h4>Ecuador is looking to re-enter the international bond market, and has spoken with representatives from Citibank and Credit Suisse about floating around $700 million in bonds. What steps are being taken in that regard?</h4><p>In April 2014, I met with institutional investors in Europe and the US to discuss Ecuador's return to the capital markets. International investors have seen the economic growth that Ecuador has experienced in recent years, as well as the current economic health of the country. But, of course, the question is: what is different now? The difference is that we are now a country that knows where we are going, and what we want for the future. We are a country that will not be an exporter of commodities, but a producer of high value-added goods. With respect to the default in 2008, the important thing to emphasize is that these bonds were not created by the Ecuadorean state. They were bonds that we had taken over as a result of the nationalization of private accounts. Private debts were taken over by the state and then restructured. Now, the new Ecuadorean constitution prohibits the nationalization of private debt, which removes the danger of this. The important point is that Ecuador is experiencing strong economic success and, in order to achieve the economic transformation we want, we need stronger financial muscle.</p><h4>Ecuador has seen strong growth fuelled by a high level of public investment. What is the plan to ensure this translates into longer-term sustainable development?</h4><p>This depends on evolution over time. If you had asked me in 2007 if Ecuador was an attractive destination for international investment, I would have told you yes, for oil and gas and for mining. Now, after the changes we have experienced over the past seven years in terms of infrastructure, energy, human capital, and the judicial system, we are facilitating new forms of investment. Ecuador is now an attractive destination for investment in non-traditional sectors, not just natural resources, and we are seeing investment from Mexico, the US, Colombia, and Peru in non-traditional sectors like food and industry. Furthermore, we have seen growth in private investment. We hope that, by the end of 2014, we will have investment in exploring our mineral resources. We have $220 billion in proven mineral resources, and private investment will play its role. FDI is not an end in itself, but it is a means to achieving development by allowing companies to create jobs and bring in their knowledge. Our development plan is something comparable to what the Asian tigers did. However, we don't have as much time as them. What they achieved in 30 years, we need to do in 10. To achieve this, we need stronger financial muscle. That is why Ecuador is working to control its current account and public spending. We have the highest level of public investment in Latin America to develop the infrastructure necessary to attract foreign investment.</p><h4>You compare Ecuador's growth model with that of the Asian tigers. One of the important elements of that growth model was technology transfer. What role does that play in Ecuador's model?</h4><p>To attract technological investments, we have been working to transform our education system in Ecuador. The city of Yachay is an ambitious plan in this regard, as it combines a technology-based university and a destination for international technological investment. We have created many advantages for technology investment, but the most important is investment in human capital. For this reason, we currently have 8,000 Ecuadorean students studying abroad on government scholarships to ensure that we have prepared the right human capital. Additionally, we have both tax incentives and a good legal framework for technology investments. We don't have the same amount of time as the Asian tigers, and for this reason we need to use what we have. What we have is natural resources, so we are using money from natural resources to fund this technology development.</p><h4>What has been the most important FDI in Ecuador in recent years?</h4><p>The most important investments have been in our industrial sector, unlike our neighbors, which have seen major investments in the mineral resource sectors. However, in the future, we are expecting to see more investments in the mining sector. This is a sector where we need foreign investors who can bring in better know-how to help us make the most of our resources.</p><h4>What has been the most important public sector investment Ecuador has made over the course of your term?</h4><p>Right now, the most important public investments we are making are in two areas. First, in the petroleum sector, we are spending around 4% of GDP in working to maintain and grow Ecuador's petroleum production. We are upgrading all of our petroleum infrastructure. These can have a return of more than 130%. The other area is the energy sector, which right now consumes 2% of GDP. We are channeling around 8% of GDP into energy investments, such as hydroelectric development, which is expected to produce a return of 1.2% of GDP from 2016 or 2017.</p><h4>What are your top policy priorities for the coming year?</h4><p>Our top priority will be to reduce the level of poverty in Ecuador. However, if we don't start to more aggressively transform the productive sector in the country, we cannot effect this economic change. That is why the President is looking to deepen the transformation of the productive matrix by creating more incentives for investment, using public investment to accelerate growth, and creating clear rules for investors. We are also working to ensure that the financial sector can provide the necessary resources to the productive sector to effect this transformation. We recently announced that this year we will be passing a new financial code, which will try to bring the financial sector in line with our development strategy to provide cheaper long-term financing for productive investment.</p><h4>Why Ecuador?</h4><p>Ecuador has a different model of development than its neighbors. We believe in our people and what they can do for Ecuador. We are not making superficial changes; we are making deep structural changes to the country that make Ecuador a favorable destination for investment. All foreign and all private investment is welcome in Ecuador as long as it respects three fundamental things: the rights of workers, payment of appropriate taxes, and respect for the environment.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What distinguishes ZHM from other providers in Ecuador's insurance sector?<br></h4><p>We present an alternative to the larger networks, and place a strong emphasis on personal service and high-quality technical solutions by having a clear understanding of how the global market and the large corporations work from an insurance perspective. We have been able to establish a matrix of service that works well for large- and medium-sized Ecuadorean corporations and at the same time for major international firms. We are brokers for SABMiller, América Móvil, Arca Continental Coca-Cola, and Bimbo among the top Ecuadorean industrial firms.</p><h4>What constitutes good service for an insurance broker?</h4><p>You first have to understand the nature of the business your client is involved in and begin assessing their risk exposure to determine and advise on the required coverage. In our line of business, we have to make sure we are aware and ready for more than meets the eye. Planning for the future is also another key factor to develop value-added partnerships at a whole different level with clients; it's imperative that we can guide them through mid-term and long-term growth and expansion. Once you understand that, you can start looking for adequate insurance partners to provide them with solutions to their needs. When I speak about service, it is because our clients are accustomed to having close connections with their partners throughout the processes of underwriting policies and claims management when needed.</p><h4>Has the recent influx of international companies into Ecuador changed the insurance sector?</h4><p>Before 2011, an estimated 40% of Ecuadorean premiums were in hands of financial bank-lead holdings. Regulations over market power and control during that year banned all banking institutions from the ownership of any business aside from the banking business itself. A swift sale process began taking shape, with interest from the big names wanting to come in, either buying in through the acquisition of bank-owned insurers or landing a spot through local privately-owned companies at a time when the market would present them with much more attractive conditions and opportunities. As a result, household names like Liberty, Mapfre, and QBE have positioned themselves alongside already established names like AIG, Generali, and ACE. We believe this trend will continue and have a positive impact on competitiveness, the supply of new insurance solutions, it's penetration measured on premiums per capita. But most importantly it will raise the level of awareness among clients of the true need to count on a professional and specialized perspective for their insurance needs. This situation will also present brokers with a major challenge; to rethink ways to align ever more demanding offers with a new wave of solutions being offered by new players, while maintaining an added value concept for both of them simultaneously.</p><h4>Do you think that is going to lead to consolidation within the rest of the market and among smaller Ecuadorean players?</h4><p>We must take into account the previous sale process started back in 2011, and the new regulations in force will require a substantial increase of capital for most companies, and tighter management of assets and reserves. All players will face the added burden of raising their capital adequacy levels and margins, which will undeniably have a negative impact on their profitability and make further consolidation inevitable.</p><h4>Do you consider regulatory reform of the insurance sector to be positive?</h4><p>The new regulations have the virtue of placing more emphasis on the strength and viability of the insurers that will carry on doing business in the next 18 months. But it presents a challenge to the new authority in allowing the companies to continue with sound business practices without overregulation and interference. It's too early to measure the full impact of the amendments just executed.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role can the Ministry play in the transformation of the production matrix in Ecuador?</h4><p>We have many opportunities to play a key role; for example, the generation of electricity with natural gas. Ecuador has reserves of up to 60 million cubic feet of natural gas. Natural gas is also expected to play a key role in boosting the development of the local pottery industry, which is internationally competitive. The Ecuadorean government is also developing the Pacific Refinery, an infrastructure project set to drive growth in the petrochemical sector. These two segments, along with oil and mining are our main contribution to the transformation of the productive matrix. The main focus of our Ministry and the government will be in the generation of electric energy and the refinery project.</p><h4>What is the importance of the Pacific Refinery project for the country?</h4><p>The Pacific Refinery will help to meet domestic demand for oil and diesel products in Ecuador. At the moment, we import about 40% of these products. The refinery will enable us to produce these products, reduce our imports, and use our resources more efficiently. The refinery also means that $5 trillion of natural resources will stay in our country, while increasing the export profile of Ecuador, which will make us a leading regional exporter. This project sets Ecuador on the path to energy independence. We have located and cleared the area and began building key infrastructure projects related to the refinery. The aqueduct, which will provide the refinery with water, will be completed in late 2014, and the design of equipment to be installed is also completed.</p><h4>What is the potential of Ecuador to develop a competitive petrochemical industry as a result of the refinery project?</h4><p>The development of a vibrant petrochemical sector is the main objective of the Pacific Refinery project, and we will progressively add products to our portfolio as we expand. We are able to offer and provide foreign investors with raw materials for the manufacture of their products, industrial facilities for operations, fiscal and legal incentives, and basic services.</p><h4>How can the restructuring of Petroamazonas and Petroecuador increase the competitive level and efficiency of those two companies?</h4><p>Petroamazonas and Petroecuador were restructured to be more efficient, as the two were involved in similar activities. Now, exploration and production is handled exclusively by Petroamazonas. This decision has already created positive results. For example, in early 2013, we produced an average of 505,000 barrels per day (bbl/d). In late 2013, production had increased to an average of 550,000 bbl/d. This growth is the result of the introduction of new technologies by Petroamazonas and increased investment in its workforce. Meanwhile, Petroecuador now manages refineries, transportation, distribution, and marketing. This restructuring has allowed the two companies to specialize, and has strengthened its business profile and efficiency.</p><h4>What are the challenges facing the oil and gas industry in terms of the supply of highly qualified human resources?</h4><p>The development of human resources is a high priority for the sector. We have established strategic partnerships with leading universities to build bridges between industry and higher education in the preparation and training of future technical workers for our country. We estimate that when the Pacific Refinery is fully operational, it will employ more than 22,000 people at its facilities, which means we will need many more skilled workers in Ecuador. We have also conducted research with international experts to predict future developments in the petrochemical sector, allowing us to properly develop and train our workforce for the future.</p><h4>What are some of the main measures implemented by the Ministry to protect the environment in some of the most controversial projects?</h4><p>We conduct exploration and production in line with international environmental standards. We also collaborate with international experts to reduce the environmental impact even further. For example, we give priority to the construction of underground pipes and secure platforms. All infrastructure projects are also built according to the standards set by the Ministry of Environment. When it comes to the construction of offshore platforms, we build according to strict international requirements. We also use very strict processes for disposal and recycling, which removes all contaminated elements from the production centers to areas where they are treated and safely recycled. Finally, we also seek technical advice from biologists, zoologists, and other specialists in flora and fauna, in order to protect ecosystems around the areas in which we produce.</p><h4>What are some of the main advantages of Ecuador's barrel system tariff for investors?</h4><p>We have a very attractive investment structure where the government recognizes the return on investment made by the companies, plus interest, and the costs of operation. This has generated a lot of interest from overseas, and we have a waiting list that includes companies from around the world. We provide these incentives in the context of a stable business environment, and the strengthening of our political and legal framework. Ecuador has areas of high development potential in the near future, and the arrival of even more international investors is expected.</p><h4>In your opinion, do regulatory reforms adopted in 2013 in the mining industry in Ecuador make the industry attractive to investors?</h4><p>We are still working on the full implementation of these amendments, but in the last couple of years we have built bridges with the private sector and the mining industry. At the moment, there are two Chinese companies operating in Ecuador, which have had a very active role in conducting research on the profitability and feasibility of developing large copper mining projects in Ecuador. We should note that large mining projects require long-term vision. Large investments are required, and the return is often realized only after 10 or 15 years. Mining is an attractive sector in Ecuador today, but there are some segments that require large investments that have adopted regulatory changes to ensure that the sector realizes its potential.</p><h4>What are some of your main priorities as Minister for the next few years?</h4><p>One of my priorities is to promote exploration in southeastern Ecuador, and to better identify the resources available there, especially hydrocarbons. We must also continue to develop existing mining projects and boost exploration activities along the Andes. While countries like Chile, Peru, and Colombia have active copper mines, Ecuador does not have them. The same applies to the gold mining industry. These are all areas that require greater investment. We plan to conduct research along the Andes to establish the true potential of the area, and we will use this data to attract foreign investors to Ecuador, a country that enjoys political and economic stability, and where a legal framework has been established.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>President Correa recently said in an interview that his number one goal for the country was social and economic development. What role does Corporación Financiera Nacional (CFN) play in that?</h4><p>CFN is more active on the financial and economic development side. The government has always been trying to foster a stronger relationship with the private sector. Most of the infrastructure and investment is at an adequate level, and our roads, airports, and energy infrastructure is in place. Education and healthcare are also crucial areas for further investment, and once we have all those basics set up we can invite the private sector to join us in making this model sustainable. Their role is really important. We want at least to maintain the current level of investment, not relying only on the public sector and government side. You have to invite other partners to help us deal with this model. In terms of CFN's role, we are an economic group; not just a financial institution or a bank. We recently went to market with a program called Progresar, which comprises three products. The first one is the National Guarantee Fund, which is essentially an engine for SMEs. The second is long-term financing for fixed assets. Both products already have clients. The third one we are working on is seed capital for entrepreneurs. We will also likely offer venture capital. Once these programs start up and evolve they can enter the market. Those are the three major projects we plan to offer to foster the transformation of the country's productive matrix.</p><h4>Do you think that the current level of development of Ecuador's capital markets is a challenge that is holding back economic development?</h4><p>Unfortunately, it is. We now have a new law that we hope will encourage new investors to tap the market. We perceive the capital markets as a financing tool, which is why CFN also helps by buying papers. Of course, it is a shallow market, but at least we are helping at a modest level. The idea is to introduce more players and to get more people to invest in the capital markets and local companies, or any companies that are listed. The secondary market is of paramount importance to deepen the market. We foresee companies not only relying on loans, but also tapping the capital markets.</p><h4>What is your vision of the Ecuadorean economy and its international role over the coming decade?</h4><p>I am really confident in what we are doing, and we should continue on this road. Both the government and the private sector have made helpful contributions to developing the national economy. Over the coming years, there will be more Ecuadorean companies exporting value-added goods, and the most relevant element, over 5,000 Ecuadorean students that are studying abroad, at some of the best universities in the world, will make a world of difference. The country will be on the path to becoming a knowledge hub a decade from now. Even today, without that superb benefit, we have a different approach to life. Citizens have improved their living standards, and have developed a better attitude toward education.</p><h4>What are the strengths of Ecuador as an investment destination?</h4><p>Investment in human capital and knowledge should come first. Back to 1997, when Intel was trying to establish a plant in Latin America, its staff visited Chile, Brazil, and some other countries in Central America. They had been considering Chile, but they ended up going to Costa Rica, since the country was committed to preparing engineers and had established technical institutes and universities that would make Intel's investment sustainable by providing human capital. Educated people will always make the difference. Of course, many other conditions had to be met as well, such as a safe and secure environment and adequate regulations.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main achievements of the Ministry since it was founded five years ago?<br></h4><p>Our Ministry is rather young and has just 100 people working in it. The core reasons behind its establishment were the importance of new technologies and the information society in the development of Ecuador. Some of our top priorities back then were the modernization and upgrading of certain institutions linked to the sector, such as the Civil Register, which deals with the identification of Ecuadorean citizens, Correos del Ecuador (the national postal company of Ecuador), Corporación Nacional de Telecomunicaciones (the public telecommunications corporation of Ecuador), and the National Register of Public Data, among others. Therefore, we can proudly say that the Ministry has become rather iconic within public administration, having performed vital tasks in this sphere. We have updated services, boosted technology, and changed old patterns. In sum, I believe that we have achieved much over the past five years, leading key transformational processes for Ecuador through innovation and our flexibility as an organization.</p><h4>How have these achievements impacted the economy?</h4><p>According to available data, we have achieved significant change during a period of unprecedented growth for Ecuador. Internet penetration rose from 6% to almost 70% during this period when we went from being the bottom country in terms of broadband access to topping the table, according to US research. We currently have the fastest internet in the region at 3.6 Mb/s. Overall, our work has been constant and steady, as we had to create all the infrastructure and then provide services that today are available to Ecuadorean society. In another example, five years ago there was only 3,000 kilometers of fiber optic in the country, whereas today the figure has reached 35,000 kilometers.</p><h4>What has been the Ministry's approach to improving access to technology in Ecuador, and what programs have you implemented to achieve this?</h4><p>We have implemented many nationwide programs to democratize technology services such as internet access For example, we have created the so-called “Info Centers," spaces to provide training, equipment, and tools to democratize internet access in Ecuador. Today, we are nearing 2 million visits to these centers in a country of 14 million inhabitants. In this context, we have seen a boost in entrepreneurship among citizens of rural Ecuador thanks to these Info Centers, and they can now utilize the network to advertise and sell their products by leveraging the infrastructure that we have installed. Approximately 500 such centers have been established nationwide. Additionally, we have seven mobile classrooms, whose main aim is to reach remote areas of the country to provide internet training and access to people living in remoter areas, which tend to be those on the lowest income. This program received international recognition for its efforts to build an inclusive system for new technologies. Over 250,000 people have already benefited from this program. We have also established the School Connectivity Program, the aim of which is to interconnect all public schools across the country by setting up a special lab within the school with computers and internet access. Currently, 7,000 schools are connected, while at the beginning of our term there were none. Our goal is to reach 9,000 schools by the end of this government's term. Also, we have already started providing schools with Wi-Fi areas for students, staff, and even parents. So far, the eight largest public schools in the country already have Wi-Fi, and we aim to ensure that all public schools across the country become Wi-Fi spots. This project, alongside the two I mentioned before, impact as many as 5 million people in Ecuador.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What would you say is the role science and technology play in Ecuador's efforts to transform the productive matrix?<br></h4><p>It has an essential role, for technology and science contribute to strengthening the quality of human resources. The government has a vision that the transformation of the country's production matrix has to be based on the development of the finite resources in society, meaning the development of a society of knowledge through innovation. In this context, the country invests large amounts to make sure that the main value added to society is knowledge. To achieve this, it is necessary to develop, on the one hand, a strong education and culture system, and, on the other hand, a strong science, technology, and innovation system. We are at this particular stage right now.</p><h4>What is the importance of Yachay in these efforts?</h4><p>In the higher education segment, we still engaged in a nationwide reform since 2007 that entails the adoption of a new organic law, a restructuring of the system to eliminate lower quality higher education centers, and increasing expenditure budgets—from 1.1% to 2% of the GDP since 2007. In fact, we are the country with the largest expenditure on education in the region. We also put a lot of emphasis on human talent, and this is why we set up a Bachelor's degree in teacher training and education. We have also become the country with the best remuneration for researchers. We are in the process of developing four new universities, while also restructuring the network of technology institutes. We aim to build closer bridges between the private sector and the higher education system. We increased the budget for research, innovation and technology from 0.2% to 0.72% of GDP. We have also started strengthening the degree courses related to the pedagogical and educational sciences, because we believe the structural change has to do with childhood, primary, and secondary education. We want to further push the role of innovation and creativity through technological and industrial parks. Regarding Yachay, it is the physical space that will contribute to these and other developments, creating economic environments within research institutes, universities, and other such centers. Yachay will be the innovation center of Ecuador; a city, a company, and a university representing the innovation system of the country. It has to work also as a specialized cluster where people will live and generate innovation, knowledge, research, and future developments for Ecuador.</p><h4>What is the importance of international partnerships for the development of education and research in Ecuador?</h4><p>One of our first duties has to do with catching up, and we know international partnerships can give us that knowledge transfer we need. Ecuador's current stage of development requires that knowledge transfer right now. We need to boost ties between local universities and the main research and innovation centers around the world, for this is key for the development of a knowledge-based society. We also bring our view into it with several programs such as scholarships—at the moment, we grant over 9,000 scholarships for Ecuadorean students and researchers to study in the best universities in the world.</p><h4>What are the main objectives of the Secretariat for the next few years?</h4><p>Our top priority has been to strengthen the innovation system in Ecuador. Before the presidency of Correa, no government had the vision to guide its development. We also must make sure that innovation, technology, and education have sufficient financial resources for their development.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Yachay University styles itself as the City of Knowledge. What does that mean?<br></h4><p>Yachay University's concept involves the creation of a science and technology park. A global city is going to be built where people can experience the latest technology and world-class companies can maintain permanent communication and exchange businesses. Its full name is Universidad de Investigación de Tecnologí­a Experimental, and it is a fundamental part of our overall project. National public-sector research centers are based across the university, and we are also partnering with a number of enterprises around the world in projects to develop R&amp;D facilities within the city. From an economic perspective, one of the most important aspects of the city is entrepreneurship. As we seek investment from established companies, we offer them a complete business system to allow for the creation of new enterprises and start-ups. Essentially, Yachay is an ecosystem for innovation, with all systems, public services, and high-quality, advanced technologies in place. It is also important that we are not competing in the way China did in the international market 20 years ago, on the basis of having the lowest labor costs in the world. Rather, we are trying to develop a system known for having the most qualified engineers and scientists available. Classical academia in Latin America is not traditionally about connecting entrepreneurs and the industrial sector. We have a triple-helix concept, which aims to coordinate the relationship between the public sector, academia, and industry. The public sector and academia used to invest heavily in basic research, while industry, in contrast, pursued margins. Therefore, Yachay University bridges the gap between basic and applied research and the end product.</p><h4>How will you facilitate the transfer of knowledge between social segments?</h4><p>The national constitution recognizes three subsystems in our economy. The first one is the private sector, which guarantees the rights to private property, which is far removed from the model of the traditional socialist regime. The second subsystem is the state sector. And in Ecuador, we have another one, the popular solidarity economy, which involves communal and cooperative property. Ecuador is home to 14 nationalities, each with their own understanding of the law and the economy. Yachay University cannot merely develop a strategy that guarantees the active role of public enterprises. Its role is to develop the city holistically, and to commercialize technology. In the 1970s, we developed Petroecuador to create an oil-based economy, and in the 1980s we created Corporación Nacional de Telecomunicaciones to develop the ICT sector. We have developed Yachay because technology and knowledge underpin the future. The private sector is the developer of these new businesses, along with established companies. Our role as the state is to enable knowledge transfer from Yachay to the private companies that are developing the sector. The popular solidarity economy, which consists of cooperatives, such as collectives of banana farmers, is also important in Ecuador. One of the commercial failings of this sector is its lack of access to technology. This represents the difference between, for example, an Ecuadorean banana cooperative and Dole. Dole obtains its seeds from Monsanto; it purchases them at a low price and has its own laboratories. A banana cooperative may have 10,000 farmers, but lacks such technology, so it has to buy seeds from abroad. They are, therefore, tied to the technological package of fertilizers and pesticides that they have to import. The final price is also quite different. This type of business has no way of developing its own technology in order to be competitive. Yachay's role is not only technological, but also social and educational when it comes to offering new opportunities to the community and introducing new ways to generate income.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Xerox contributed to the economic development of Ecuador?</h4><p>While Xerox has been growing annually, our goal has also been to promote our team's efficiency and productivity as much as needed to achieve the right goals. In that sense, for many years, we have set out our expectations according to a number of metrics such as customer and distributor satisfaction, which are both on the rise. Paper use is decreasing daily due to several environmental factors, adding up to efficiency and cost savings. For many years, this has been a negative trend for us, because we have been focused on printing paper. Now, we have recognized that the only way to survive in this multimedia world is by concentrating on creating efficient solutions in document management. Therefore, Xerox has always been a partner for our customers and not just a retailer. We focus on a few different market segments, including SMBs and top-tier corporates. On these three levels, we have always made an effort to provide efficiency through consulting to our business partners. Our consulting services are based on managing their documentation processes to better understand how we can assist them. Being a business partner implies generating networking relations at all corporate levels and investing money, time, and technology. After all, we have a similar approach to smaller businesses. As a result of our consulting services, we have transformed our business model. At the same time, we have promoted the digital document process geared toward customer productivity.</p><h4>What is the importance of Ecuador within Xerox's global portfolio?</h4><p>Xerox Ecuador has been the best operation model around the globe over the past four or five years. There are four main regions, including the US and Canada, Asia, Europe, and the emerging markets such as Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, and the CIS. Among these 180 countries, Ecuador has delivered the best performance and YoY growth. We have also had the largest market share increase and have implemented many unique services over the past three years.</p><h4>Why is the Ecuadorean market such a strong performer for Xerox?</h4><p>There are several reasons behind this, one being that Xerox has been here for around 48 years. For instance, our success is our passion; we're proud to be Ecuadorean and hard workers. Also, our customer's trust due to our value proposition is key.</p><h4>In 2013, you mentioned that Xerox still faced the challenge of being perceived to be focused on paper. What have you been doing to change that?</h4><p>This has been hard for us to be honest. We've been emphasizing Xerox's involvement in digitalization and the outsourcing of technology business processes, including the banking segment. Our communication to top executives is that Xerox offers IT services and more. We are now closing deals on this matter with some of the largest companies in the region. This organization is divided horizontally and vertically, meaning that we have units that focus on specific segments such as electronic archiving and banking and education services. One of our projects, Yachay Laboratories, is where we're investing to develop new service technologies.</p><h4>How important is the public sector for Xerox in Ecuador?</h4><p>The government in Ecuador is an important customer that has multiple service requirements. There are around 6,000 companies in this segment, meaning the government is our biggest client.</p><h4>Looking forward, what are your major goals for the next few years?</h4><p>First of all, our customers are our main focus. Xerox is doing well in terms of revenue, profit, market share, inventory, and collections. However, our purpose is to leave a legacy based on more than financial results. Secondly, our customers are going to receive fewer documents printed by Xerox, because we are corporate citizens, and conscious about the environment. Consequently, we develop software, technology, and electronics in order to cut down on paper use.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What do you see as your mission and goals as president of the board of the Ecuadorean Institute of Social Security (IESS)?<br></h4><p>We have some important goals in health and banking, and we are trying to improve public healthcare by bringing more doctors into the system over the next few months. We will be hiring approximately 900 family doctors and 600 specialist doctors, who will work around the country at 96 hospitals and health centers. We are trying to improve the way that we serve our members nationally, and to generate a new system based on value. We want to bring a more human face to our health services, while improving the manner in which we provide access to medicine. There are three ways to do this: we can do it ourselves, which is what we have been doing until now; secondly, we can distribute medicine through private pharmacies, and thirdly, we have a public business called Enfarma, which is a government enterprise, through which we also distribute medicine. We work with both private and public hospitals, and are keen to link them in a broader, stronger system. In terms of banking, we work with mortgage credit and consumer credit, with a value of $1.32 billion in the former and $1.44 billion in the latter.</p><h4>IESS is involved in the Ecuadorean economy. How important is its role in funding national development?</h4><p>One of the key ways in which we improve the rate of national growth is through construction. If we can increase construction credit then we can expedite growth, which naturally is of direct benefit to the national economy.</p><h4>How could the public and private sectors best cooperate in Ecuador?</h4><p>We have a productive relationship with the private sector, and utilize its services for the benefit of our members. We also work together with private banks for access to credit. We are not trying to increase our market share, but rather to improve the quality and value of our service offering. We have also worked with the private sector on construction projects, building hospitals, and housing. The best path for us, for the country, and for our members, is for the private and public sectors to work in tandem, because there are certain areas in which the private sector is stronger, and others better suited to the public sector. We also need to increase the quality of human value we give our members, in terms of transparency, honesty, and good service.</p><h4>What role would you like IESS and BIESS to play in the Ecuadorean economy over the coming years?</h4><p>I envisage a social security system in which people have confidence, and one able to give members all the services they need in terms of healthcare and pensions. It will be a system that can work for everyone from the beginning of their working lives right through to retirement.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In your capacity as Minister, what do you currently identify as the greatest strengths and weaknesses of Ecuador's transport infrastructure?<br></h4><p>Our greatest strength right now is that the national government and the Ministry finally have an integrated vision that takes into account all modes of transport and the connections between them. During the term of this government, as part of the “citizens revolution," there has been increased investment in multi-modal transport infrastructure, which for many years had been unattended to, or non-existent, in order to provide the most modern transport and logistics systems, as well as promote greater regional integration for Ecuador. Furthermore, Ecuador has a national road network of the first order, which serves as a base for maintaining high levels of service, allowing conservation of the network. Finally, we have airports that can meet the needs of our economy with modern systems of navigation.</p><p>With the implementation of the National Strategic Plan for Mobility and Transport, we are working to overcome many of the weaknesses that persist in our transport system. We will have a balanced and integrated road system, which will connect the entire country with infrastructure that is modern, and fit for purpose, for all modes of transport. We will also have secure roads that meet international standards allowing us to increase capacity. Additionally, our airports and seaports will be standardized to international norms, and our railways will have an integrated automated signaling system. Finally, overall, we are working to develop improved multi-modal transport integration between all forms of transport.</p><h4>What efforts is the government making to ensure that Ecuador's maritime sector remains competitive with the expansion of the Panama Canal?</h4><p>Our three priorities in this area are to define a national vision and policy for our ports, to develop the Sectoral Port Plan, and to continue investing according to the needs of each port. In addition, the development of the Port of Manta will permit ships of a greater draft to come to Ecuador's ports, which will allow us to receive vessels whose only other option is Panama.</p><h4>What is your vision for the air travel sector in Ecuador?</h4><p>The vision of the Ministry with respect to the air travel sector is based on coordinated investment in infrastructure and services, as much in the air travel sector as in the airports themselves, in order to develop national destinations and bring benefits to the regions located within the area of influence of these airports. This has motivated the gradual growth in routes and frequencies within the country. In accordance with the investments that have been made, the Ministry is updating the Air Services Agreements with our sister nations, in order to improve international air travel connectivity and attract a wider network of transport services to benefit passengers and improve our export capacity.</p><h4>What role can the private sector have in the development of Ecuador's transport infrastructure?</h4><p>By using public-private partnership (PPP) models, we can increase investment in infrastructure in Ecuador. It should also be mentioned that the construction sector, specifically relating to transport infrastructure, has benefited from a historic level of investment in recent years.</p><h4>What are your priorities for transport and infrastructure policies?</h4><p>Our top priority is to guarantee access to transport and mobility services that are inclusive, secure, and sustainable on a local and international level. I also want to use transport policy to promote the conditions of competitiveness and productivity that are necessary to enable the transformation of the productive matrix, and the consolidation of the most equitable structures for the generation and distribution of wealth. Overall, my goal is to enable connectivity through different modes of transport at the highest standards of quality.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance of TAME for Ecuador's transportation system?<br></h4><p>TAME connects the country. If you compare TAME to other airlines in Ecuador, such as LAN or AeroGal—AeroGal belongs to Avianca Group—you will see that TAME's coverage is much wider. Other companies tend to focus on highly profitable destinations, such as the Galápagos Islands. The basic principal of TAME is to fly within our home country. We connect almost 15 different destinations in the country, including the Amazon region, the Galápagos Islands, and coastal Ecuador. We have nine international destinations that connect Ecuador to other Latin American countries and the US. TAME has flights to Sío Paulo, Buenos Aires, Lima, Panama City, Caracas, Havana, and New York.</p><h4>Is part of TAME's mission to act as a representative for the country internationally?</h4><p>There is an interesting development happening all over the world. Larger airlines are disappearing because of the economic downturn. Fuel, pilot training, and aircraft are becoming incredibly expensive. In Southern America, international airlines are leaving the market. They have left a duopoly in the airline sector in Latin America with only LAN and Avianca Group. Recently, Avianca Group started a joint venture with TAM from Brazil. TAME plays a major role in attracting tourists to Ecuador and helping to keep prices competitive. Before TAME launched regular flights to Bogotá, you would possibly pay $800 for a one-hour flight from Quito to Bogotá. In 2007-2008, if you wanted to travel from Quito to Buenos Aires, you would pay $1,500. Today, the prices have reduced considerably—now you will only pay $400 for a flight from Quito to Bogotá—it is half of the price you had to pay before TAME launched this route.</p><h4>In 2011, TAME became a public company. What was the importance of this transition for TAME?</h4><p>Before 2011, TAME belonged to the Ecuadorean Air Force. In 2011, it became a 100% state-owned company. The Ministry of Transport, the institution responsible for delivering government policy in the transport industry, has jurisdiction over the company. The Ecuadorean Air Force was focused on offering transport services within the country and didn't consider the international market. Another major change concerns our commercial strategy. The price of tickets is now related to the time you are buying them, and changes if you buy the tickets a day or a month before the scheduled flight. The image and branding of the company has changed, too.</p><h4>What does TAME do to compete with the duopoly in the airline business?</h4><p>We have a number of distinctive features. Our key advantage is the connectivity between Quito and the rest of the country. In the summer of 2014, we are establishing a huge hub in Quito. It will stand in line with international hubs in Lima and Bogotá, and will have a very short transiting time of 30 to 60 minutes.</p><h4>Is New York important addition in the transition of Quito into a hub?</h4><p>Yes, because currently, the flight to New York departs from Guayaquil, and soon it will depart from Quito. As a part of this strategy, we will also have a flight to Ft. Lauderdale. It is both cheaper and faster to fly there than to Miami, although Miami Airport is convenient for transit passengers. However, there are many flights, and sometimes you need to wait for three hours or more in transit. The headquarters of many major North American airline companies are also located in Ft. Lauderdale.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the profound economic transformation of the past decade changed the focus of Consorcio Nobis and the way the company approaches the economy in Ecuador?<br></h4><p>For the consortium, the past 10 years have been a time for development based on a specific strategy. We are now in a position whereby the economy has helped us prepare a long-term investment strategy, in order to reach goals in specific areas. We are a highly structured consortium, but at the same time greatly diversified. As such, any hiccup in the economy could affect one of the many industries that we handle, including agriculture, energy, the commercial sector, and real estate. We are, therefore, highly exposed, but Ecuador's sustained economic health allows us to undertake larger challenges. These will bring more jobs and opportunities for the people and third parties involved in our projects.</p><h4>When you say, thinking more about long-term planning, does that mean larger investments?</h4><p>Yes it does, an example being our real estate developer company. Formerly, we had projects for one or two specific buildings, while subsequent growth has seen us look into the niche of a city within a city: a microcosmic zone of five to 10 buildings. And now we are moving on to having a larger city beyond Guayaquil. This is a project that over the span of eight years will be an investment of $700 million. It will feature between 35 and 40 buildings, with comprehensive services: from dining to commercial, to sustain around 3,000 families.</p><h4>Do you feel there has been a change in the international perception of Ecuador?</h4><p>Ecuador has had political stability, which is important for economic stability. That is what we as entrepreneurs and investors need, because in order to grow and see the future and keep growing, we need clear rules of the game. Therefore, stability gives us the capacity for strategic investment either through the owners' money, external investors, or seeking credit lines.</p><h4>What is the main focus sector for Consorcio Nobis currently?</h4><p>We have learned to pay attention to what the government has envisioned in its strategic plan for Ecuador. We are involved in all of the sectors where the government is gathering the strength for you to go and invest. We are looking at tourism, to go along with one of our real estate units and hotels that we manage. We are also looking at energy, in terms of ethanol production, which is a sector on the government's strategic agenda. Meanwhile, we have major port project that remains a key focus for the next five years because of it logistical significance. With the roads that we now have, logistics will be the next threshold for the country to cross.</p><h4>What role do you see for Consorcio Nobis in Ecuador's efforts to transform the productive matrix?</h4><p>We are doing this on the energy front. We are going to look more closely at contributing through the production of ethanol, so that there will be less reliance on imported gas. For each gallon of gasoline consumed, 70% is imported. And that goes into subsidies and cost, which costs the country. If we can help with the local production of ethanol, then we will retain revenues in our own economy. This will mean more jobs, new developments in a proactive sense with new plans, and meanwhile, the economy will move along more quickly.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[big-players-thinking-small]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What motivated Grupo Promerica's acquisition of Produbanco in Ecuador?</h4><p>There were several factors behind this very important decision. Banco Promerica has been present in Ecuador for 14 years in what has been a successful experience. It rose from a small finance company to the eighth-largest bank in a very competitive environment. Another reason was that Grupo Promerica was looking to expand its banking business, and Central America is already concentrated and saturated. The third reason is that Produbanco was the fourth largest bank and was considered one of the best operators in Ecuador. Additionally, Grupo Promerica decided to increase its presence in this market; combining both banks gives us around a 12.3% market share. I would also have to add that Ecuador is a dollarized economy with a healthy macroeconomic performance, and the fact that it has a hard currency is also crucial in making such decisions.</p><h4>What is the significance of this acquisition for Grupo Promerica?</h4><p>Grupo Promerica is a Central American banking group with over $10 billion in assets. Promerica is present in nine countries in Latin America: Ecuador, Panama, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala, and the Dominican Republic. Additionally, the principal shareholders of Promerica Financial Corporation own Terrabank N.A., a community banking operation in south Florida, US. Produbanco and Banco Promerica combined will represent approximately 39% of the group's total assets. However, one of Promerica's initiatives is to ensure that no country represents more than a 25% share of the group's assets. So in essence, the banking operations in all other countries will continue to grow in order to balance out this 39% share. Grupo Promerica grows approximately $600 million in assets per year across the nine countries. Eventually we will reach this goal, where we (Produbanco) should account for no more than 25%.</p><h4>Would you now consider Produbanco to be an international player in Ecuador's banking sector?</h4><p>Produbanco is a local bank with international shareholders. Produbanco is the fourth largest bank in Ecuador, and has a solid and impeccable reputation over its 35 years of operations in this market. Grupo Promerica's strategy in the nine countries it operates in is to promote itself as a local bank. Part of Promerica's success has been based upon being close to the client. You can have a regional umbrella, but not necessarily be viewed as an international global bank. We compete against that view. We like to be considered local and we want to be very close to our clients.</p><h4>What does being local mean for the way you do business in Ecuador?</h4><p>First of all, we are in a country witnessing the burgeoning presence of local corporations and entrepreneurs. What we are doing with the Promerica umbrella here is giving local corporations an alternative view of banking not only in Ecuador, but also outside Ecuador. Produbanco joining Promerica thus widens the umbrella of opportunities for these clients. Produbanco is the key corporate bank in Ecuador. In that role, we can also help corporate clients to expand their business. For example, Ecuador is an importer of many products including consumer goods and other raw materials. We need increasingly large lines of credit for trade finance. Produbanco and other competitors are subject to country risk and its limits. Grupo Promerica has a definite advantage as our credit limits are in line with our presence in nine countries and thus we, internally, can compensate with the excesses experienced in the other markets. In essence, we have introduced this value-added strategy into what is already a solid bank. This is propelling it into an international arena that Produbanco was not previously a part of.</p><h4>How has growth of the middle class changed the banking sector in Ecuador?</h4><p>First of all, it allowed banking to become national. Originally, the banks were either from Quito or Guayaquil, and they stayed within their regions. Since 2001, inflation rates are obviously closer to those observed in the US, so actual growth in income has clearly benefited lower income groups, which, in turn, have advanced into this growing middle class. Once basic needs are met there is the will to direct excess funds elsewhere. That has transpired into housing and auto loans, credit cards, and other consumer products. It helped people start to experience a better quality of life, as the banking sector was there with products that allowed them to purchase new consumer and household products.</p><h4>What role can the financial sector play in supporting the transformation of the productive matrix?</h4><p>It does make a large contribution to the success of that venture. However, there are major industries that greatly exceed our capacity to fund; the large hydroelectric projects, refinery, petrochemical projects, and so on. We already fulfill our social responsibilities within the banking industry, which is to recirculate and be an intermediary for funds. The main issue for the banking sector revolves around how everyone can work to increase the short-term nature of Ecuadoreans' savings into a longer-term scenario where funding becomes available for expansion. Today I would say, being responsible, we are probably at the limit of what that gap should be. We should not take any further risk engaging in long-term financing with short-term funding. We also need to work with the authorities toward a consensus. The ideas being proposed are excellent, and we want to play our part in any subsequent transition, but in a technical and professional manner. My responsibility and the responsibilities of everyone at Produbanco today are mainly directed towards our depositors. I have to make sure that we have sufficient liquidity to operate the bank safely. This is a highly important issue that we need to look at from a technical perspective. The ultimate responsibility of a bank's CEO is toward the depositors, not credit, the latter being a matter of fact. If I offered a 10-year credit facility at 1% interest, I would have a line of keen customers from here to Colombia. But taking long-term deposits requires confidence, and involves the building up of a bank. It is a question of assuring your depositors that money is always available.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Vault Into The Breach]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[vault-into-the-breach]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As a publicly owned private bank, how would you characterize the role that Banco del Pací­fico plays in Ecuador's banking sector?</h4><p>Banco del Pací­fico is a private bank that was purchased by the Central Bank of Ecuador after the financial crisis in 1999, meaning that today the state is the owner of Banco del Pací­fico. However, we have preserved our independence and our activity does not depend on the national budget. In a way, the bank has become a channel to comply with the public delineation of economic policy. For example, we have been active in financing activity within the transformation of the production matrix. We have also played an important role in providing funding for strategic sectors, and in 2013, we provided credit lines worth $350 million to strategic sectors. This has represented a shift in terms of earlier priorities, as we used to have a stronger focus on retail banking.</p><h4>What is the balance between corporate and individual clients in your portfolio?</h4><p>Today, 90% of our clients are from the corporate segment. However, if we add the activity of Incorporar, a company engaging in retail banking and the credit cards business, the balance would be 55% corporate and 45% individual. The vision of the company is to further increase the percentage of the corporate segment, as well as achieving a greater share of financing within the SME segment. Finally, our main aim is to provide high-quality products and services so our clients feel satisfied with us.</p><h4>What are the competitive advantages of Banco del Pací­fico for corporate clients?</h4><p>We offer competitive and attractive terms for credit lines according to their specific nature. Our interest rates are also competitive for these products. In addition, we offer role management through electronic systems for our corporate clients, and financial and technical consultancy services. Our credit lines are flexible in all senses. This is all part of our business strategy; to prioritize global profitability over basic economic profitability.</p><h4>How do you see the bank contributing to the national economy?</h4><p>We do not see our contribution to the country's development strictly from an economic point of view, but as a concatenation of the different economic sectors that contribute to the development of the country. We are active in credit lines for the construction sector as well as for the purchase of housing units. We know the construction sector is important for the national economy, and as a result we offer credit lines to people constructing housing units and to those who are purchasing them. We try to do the same in other economic sectors. We also try to invest in government bonds and treasury certificates; though this is not our priority, we also take part in these types of investments.</p><h4>How would you assess the presence of international banks in the country?</h4><p>At the moment their presence is relatively small, especially if you take into account that in the past it was much larger. This is because the economy is still in a process of expansion into the regional arena, and is attempting to improve the position of local banks. At the moment, there is not much space for foreign banks, as large local banks manage the sector well. This means that local banks are meeting the demand of those multinationals present in Ecuador. For example, one of our main clients is Holcim, and we have strong and productive ties with it, meaning that we always come up with new products to meet its needs.</p><h4>What are some of the key measures the bank implements to support SMEs?</h4><p>SMEs have traditionally been a strong segment for us. However, over the past few years their importance has decreased. We want to change these dynamics again, and we are set to implement a series of strategies to regain our market share in this segment. We have a $150 million budget to use until the end of the year for specific actions aimed at this segment. We want to revive and revitalize this part of the bank with a medium- to long-term vision. I also think there is a huge opportunity in this segment, as SMEs are to be the main economic drivers of our future economic expansion.</p><h4>What role do new technologies play in Banco del Pací­fico's business strategy?</h4><p>We were the pioneering bank in the development of new technologies in the banking sector in Ecuador. However, as occurred with the SME segment, this was gradually forgotten and we are attempting to bring it back, as I believe that the future of the sector is based on electronic channels. We were the first banking institution to introduce so-called recycler ATMs, which enable our clients to do other transactions and make payments 24 hours a day, seven days a week. We have also provided our clients with the tools at the local level (in small shops and pharmacies) to pay their bills and other invoices in those physical spaces.</p><h4>What is the bank's future strategy?</h4><p>We have allocated a budget of $400 million for credit lines for the strategic economic sectors over 2014. In 2015, this figure should reach the $500 million mark. Our challenge is to continue growing in the student loan segment, as well as in mortgages and SMEs, and we hope to reach $200 million in credit lines. I want to make this bank into Ecuador's leading banking institution within five to 10 years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-capital-idea]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does Fiducia play in Ecuador's financial sector?<br></h4><p>Fiducia began its active presence in the financial sector in Ecuador in 1994. Initially, we positioned ourselves as one of the first providers of financial services for real estate projects. Later, we expanded to defeasance trusts, administrative trusts, and then securitization. We created the first securitization system in Ecuador, which consisted of the value of the cash flows resulting from the money spent by foreigners in Ecuador using MasterCard credit cards. MasterCard decided to securitize these flows, and we realized this transaction in 2003. This opened up an expanded method for us to participate in Ecuador's capital markets.</p><h4>What is your current characterization of Ecuador's capital markets?</h4><p>From our point of view, in order for Ecuador's capital markets to play a more significant role in the country's financial sector, the two sides of the capital markets, the issuers of non-bank securities on one side and the institutional investors that are going to purchase these securities on the other, need to be compatible. Securities being issued need to be designed for the investors who are going to invest in them. Speaking about capital markets in Ecuador, it is important for us to talk about the legal reform that took place in 2012. Until 2012, banking institutions were allowed to own brokerage houses and insurance companies and have fund administrators. In that year, the law that required that any shareholders of banking institutions to divest any ownership of investment or insurance companies was amended. As a result, new Ecuadorean capital markets were born without the participation of commercial banks. Another important factor in Ecuador's capital markets is the fact that the majority of the country's pension funds are concentrated in the IESS. This limits the role of pension funds in the country's capital markets, which presents a challenge for the country, because the existence of institutional investors with a high level of technical capacity is a fundamental factor in the development of capital markets.</p><h4>What is your asset allocation strategy?</h4><p>The portfolio structure of each of our funds depends on the objective of that fund. Currently, the assets in which we have been investing are fundamentally domestic. This is for two reasons; the first is because Ecuador is a dollarized country, which is an important advantage, and the profits from local investments are in US dollars. Secondly, as Ecuador has taxes on foreign capital flows it is more difficult to move money in and out of the country. As a result of these fees, the Ecuadorian dollar is only worth about 95% of the dollar internationally. This means that it makes more sense to invest in Ecuador and keep profits in the country. As a result, this makes foreign investments less competitive because it is more difficult to invest in them and repatriate the profits. This is a secondary factor though. The primary factor is that in Ecuador, there is still a great need for the availability of better financial instruments through the capital markets. This need exists on two fronts. On one side, it is necessary for companies that are looking for long-term financing for new business ventures of the kind that are usually not financed through bank loans. On the other side, the deposit rate that financial institutions are paying for savers is not appealing when inflation is factored in.</p><h4>Have you seen interest in your funds from international investors?</h4><p>Yes, we have hosted institutional investors, who usually manage family wealth funds. It appears to me that they are looking for low-risk funds in emerging markets. They come to us because we administer the only fund in Ecuador that has a risk rating of AAA-. They are looking for good risk ratings and, of course, profitability. Our funds yield such high profitability because they include corporate securities with positive interest rates.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[ecuadorean-spice]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why did you enter the food sector upon arriving in Ecuador in 1975?</h4><p>When I arrived in the town of Quevedo, I was considering potential business opportunities. I started working in a restaurant with a Chinese partner, and I saw that Ecuadorean cuisine uses color for the palate, such as sauces, but I noticed that it was difficult to find soy sauces in Ecuador. We had to import soy sauce and other sauces from China. In the absence of choice, we often ended up with products that were expensive but of low quality. I then realized that we could have better sauces if we produced them ourselves. Therefore, I started making a new sauce condiment with my own recipes. This unique sauce that I make is my own recipe, unavailable anywhere else—including sauces imported from China. The sauce is now known in Ecuador as Oriental Chinese Sauce, but actually it is a sauce that is uniquely Ecuadorean, not just because it is only made here using local ingredients, it also has a different texture from other soy sauce as it has a higher yield. I started out selling my products to Chinese restaurants, but because they were few in number at the time, I began selling to stores and supermarkets as well. From there, we have continued growing over the past 39 years. Now, because of our sauce, Quevedo is known throughout Ecuador for its Chinese rice dish know as chaulafan,"and the main seasoning is prepared with Oriental Chinese Sauce. Now we have distribution throughout 10 offices with own sales force around Ecuador.</p><h4>What role has Grupo öriental played in the economic development of Quevedo?</h4><p>We are the main agro-industry in Quevedo. We were founded here, and buy our agricultural products locally, also employing local people, and exporting our products throughout Ecuador and around the world. We have two main plants in Ecuador: one for beverages, and another for sauces, noodles, and other flour-based products. In total, we employ around 450 people in Quevedo city.</p><h4>What is the importance of having an Ecuadorean identity for Grupo Oriental?</h4><p>We are an Ecuadorean brand born in Ecuador and sustained by Ecuadoreans. But what is more important for us is to emphasize that we use Ecuadorean raw materials, produced locally, to create quality Oriental food products using our expert knowledge. We want to show Ecuadoreans, Latin Americans, Europeans, and even Chinese people that Ecuadorean raw materials can be used to make healthy and delicious Oriental food products. Some of our sauces are actually being exported to China now, such as our chili sauce, which is made with Ecuadorean chili. Ecuador can produce chili sauce all year round because of our equatorial location. We see this as an opportunity to export. More than 10% of our products are exported currently within the region, but also to Europe and China.</p><h4>What challenges have you faced growing as a food brand in Ecuador over the past 40 years?</h4><p>You have to pursue your goals every day and adapt when needed by developing new technology and products. You also need to encourage your employees to love your company, to pursue growth, and to adapt to change and innovate. In Ecuador, we have seen considerable political change over the years, but for the past seven years we have enjoyed stability.</p><h4>What role do you see for companies like Grupo Oriental to contribute to Ecuador's efforts to change the productive matrix?</h4><p>The key word there is change: we all need to change. For Grupo Oriental, we saw the opportunity to change by working to integrate plantain flour into our products rather than traditional wheat flour. Everyone knows that Ecuador produces plantains in great volume, and that plantains boast many benefits both for people and for the economy. Historically, in Ecuador, plantain used to be the main source of food, and an important source of nutrition. We realized that we could take advantage of this. We are now developing an instant plantain flour product that can be used for soups, breads, any main dishes, and other foods. For us, we started from making Chinese sauce, to noodles, to spices, to healthy beverages, to healthy products.</p><h4>What role can Grupo Oriental play in Ecuador's economy in the future?</h4><p>We decided in 1975 to invest in Ecuador because we believe in the people and the possibilities of the country. We also believe in Ecuador's agricultural potential. I started a business here with nothing but a vision. Now our aim is to establish an international Ecuadorean brand. We want our brand to transmit the idea that with Oriental products, you can experience Asian flavors using Ecuador's natural agricultural wealth. We want to be recognized internationally as an Ecuadorean brand with Oriental values and culture.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the economic transformation of the past decade changed the automotive industry?<br></h4><p>We are a company that believes in the potential of the country, which is why we implement investment plans every year. Over the last few years, we have focused on introducing better production processes to increase capacity and become a more efficient and competitive company. For example, we have successfully maintained the leading position of our brands—Nissan and Renault—in the market. Also, we emphasized the need to improve the quality of our services. For example, AYASA currently reinvests 70% of its profits back into the country. These elements position our company as a leading player in the sector. On top of that, Ecuador has enjoyed a stable political and economic environment, and the automotive industry has benefited from this. The industry has also paid special attention to the post-sales service segment over the last few years, a segment in which we have positively grown. The future will follow such trends, and we believe we have plenty of room to continue expanding our activity in this segment in particular and the sector in general.</p><h4>How has AYASA adapted its business strategy in accordance with the government's new production goals?</h4><p>We are a very flexible and dynamic company, and we saw the new industrial production approach by the government as an opportunity in itself. For example, we have been closely working with the brands that represent Nissan and Renault in Ecuador to implement an electric car project. The government has already carried out research on the potential implementation of this ambitious project and its profitability, apart from the positive environmental impact of it. We have to keep in mind that Renault and Nissan have been worldwide leaders in the mass production of these vehicles for similar projects in northern Europe, and this is a competitive advantage for us, because we see there is huge potential in Ecuador for such a project. All in all, we align ourselves with the production policies of the government, especially in the segment of electric cars.</p><h4>What is the status of the electric car project?</h4><p>We have already conducted all the relevant studies on the mass utilization of these vehicles for public company fleets. In this context, some of these companies, for example, Correos del Ecuador, have already carried out tests with these vehicles. At the moment, the government has already taken the steps to set up the regulatory framework for the implementation of this project, and the importation of these types of vehicles. Additionally, several private companies have already shown their interest and commitment to implement such an ambitious goal. AYASA will soon hand in the draft of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the government and the brands we represent in order to take a step forward in this entire process. This is an important opportunity to change the mobility culture in Ecuador and boost local production in the automotive industry through different stages—a battery recycling plant first, followed by a production and assembly plant. Future prospects foresee a potential market for electric cars of around 60,000 units per year.</p><h4>Does Ecuador have the level of human capital and technological expertise to implement such a project?</h4><p>In this context, Nissan has already offered to the Ecuadorean government to train local technicians on new technologies within the automotive industry, including electric technologies. I think the challenge could come from how to link such an offering with the development of the city of Yachay, because I believe that would be the ideal framework to make the offer come true. Renault has also made such an offer to the authorities, and we have to highlight that this offering does not only apply to research, but to the final consumer, too.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of the Ecuadorian market for Franz Viegener (FV) as a group with a presence across Latin America?<br></h4><p>FV Group has a major presence across all the major countries of Latin America, and it is divided into three parts: the plants in Argentina, which cover and service the MERCOSUR market, and which include all the countries bordering Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia, and, of course, Argentina itself; the plants in Ecuador, which service the Andean market of Ecuador, Colombia, Peru, Central America, and the Caribbean; and finally the plant in Brazil, which covers that market. The importance of Ecuador is its service to the Andean market, and our position as leader and sole manufacturer of faucets, toilets, and bathroom accessories. We also aim to become the market leaders in Colombia and Peru.</p><h4>Over the past seven years, Ecuador has seen a marked economic transformation. Has that changed the significance of Ecuador for the company?</h4><p>Since 2000 and the economy's dollarization, the role of Ecuador has been different. The company has been in Ecuador and the region for 37 years already. Over the years, Ecuador has become more relevant to the group. This relevance has been all the more important over the past five years due to the change in the productive matrix currently underway in Ecuador.</p><h4>What part of production in Ecuador is reserved for the domestic market?</h4><p>I am going to divide my answer into two parts. In terms of water management and faucets, 90% of the production is for Ecuador, and 10% is for the export market. In terms of toilets and accessories, the contribution to the commercial trade balance is even greater. In the toilet segment, 70% is for the national market, while 30% is exported.</p><h4>How large is the Ecuadorean market for FV Group?</h4><p>The group has annual revenue of $600 million, and the local operations in Ecuador represent 12%; therefore, approximately $70 million a year. The group has approximately 6,000 employees worldwide, and in our local operations, we employ around 1,200 people.</p><h4>What would you say are the strengths of Ecuador as a manufacturing base?</h4><p>First of all, I would highlight its geographic location at the center of the Pacific coast of Latin America, and second, its two great commercial neighbors, namely Colombia and Peru. Those two factors make it an interesting proposition.</p><h4>What kinds of challenges have you faced in growing your operation in Ecuador?</h4><p>One of the challenges is being able to conquer the Ecuadorean market with quality products, something that the country was not used to. The second challenge was the presence of the two great neighbors of Colombia and Peru. People usually opt for price, although price and quality do not go hand in hand. It has taken many years of work to provide technical support to constructors and installers. The experience of FV as a company has leant much support to this process.</p><h4>What role do you see for FV in Ecuador's efforts to transform the productive matrix?</h4><p>The change in the productive matrix for Ecuador is important, and we support the government's initiative. However, the importance of generating exports is greater than the importance of substituting imports. It is important for the government to monitor production quality and to ensure that it meets international standards. The local manufacturing system also needs to produce at reasonable prices. This is a highly complex and difficult issue, and demanding for the government in terms of the details and the changes that it implies. However, there should be coherence in the government's message. It is vital for the government to say that it wants to substitute imports, and also to act accordingly.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Do you think the way Empresa Nacional Minera (ENAMI EP) approaches mining in Ecuador is different to the way private sector companies do?<br></h4><p>Definitely, yes. ENAMI EP, as a public company, has two big duties. The first is to produce income for the government, and the other is to provide wealth to the communities. A private company does not have as much of a social focus. One important part of ENAMI EP's activities is to provide communities with all the requirements needed to maintain artisanal mining. We have two social projects in the country. ENAMI EP also has partnerships with associations to reduce the use of mercury.</p><h4>Ecuador has a lot of mining potential, but the country has struggled to get the mining industry to play the role in the economy that it could. Why do you think this is?</h4><p>Probably because the economy has been based on oil for the past 40 or 50 years. It was a mistake to focus solely on this sector. Of course, this sector provides the country with a lot of wealth. However, this sole focus is the reason for the country's problems at the moment. The mining activity in this country cannot just be about finding these resources and selling them. It has to be a process that provides the country with the possibility of adding value, diversifying sectors, and contributing to communities. This is the main reason for the change in the productive matrix.</p><h4>What role can the mining sector play in changing the productive matrix?</h4><p>It is important that the mining sector plays a role in this change, because we need to be responsible to the people of this country. We need to show that the country can do more than find minerals. We need to create new processes and industries. Mining activity creates more decentralization, because you invest a lot of funds into communities. Especially in the mining sector, food, transportation, goods, and housing are required, which then contributes to the overall economy. Due to the nature of the mining sector, it can also contribute to rural development. The sector also provides a lot of work for people. The sector needs to learn about new technologies, which then provide income for the government and the communities with part of the royalties. The mining law of Ecuador says the government needs to reinvest at least 60% of mining royalties into communities. Oil companies are used to producing substantial volumes of oil, and investing generated revenue solely in the capital, Quito.</p><h4>Do you think the reforms made to mining legislation in 2013 enhanced the abilities of the country to attract FDI?</h4><p>Ecuador, as a new mining country, is trying to understand how the mining sector operates here. And during this process, some mistakes have been made. However, the government has done its research and understands how it operates in the world and in the country. Some important changes are coming, because the government knows mining is a high-risk activity. Exploration also needs to be better supported, and the government is working on this.</p><h4>Is Ecuador now an attractive destination for international mining companies?</h4><p>Yes definitely, because of the country's considerable potential. The grade of minerals in Ecuador is interesting, the cost is low, and the country is competitive in the mining arena. The country has political stability, and the most important thing is that our President is greatly supportive of this industry, which shows in the highway, water, and electricity infrastructure. This may be contrasted with to a country like Chile, where one has to pump water from the ocean into mining projects. The government is preparing for this industrial era by building roads, ports, airports, and hydropower plants, all of which are attractive to investors.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Over the past seven years, internet penetration in Ecuador has grown from 6% to 70%. How has that changed the sector and the way you do business?<br></h4><p>The internet is becoming commonplace nowadays, and the industry is becoming more mature. We have grown significantly in both urban and rural communities, not only in terms of the total user numbers, but also in average internet speed. We can safely say that Telconet and its brands are by far the greatest contributors to the average speed of connections in Ecuador, which has the fastest speed after Mexico since January 2014. In mid-2014, we will surpass Mexico with an offering of 100 Mbps for less than $40. Coverage has increased, and we have grown to 60,000 registered users, while adding 3,000 to 4,000 users a month. We stand to become the Latin American leader in broadband speed.</p><h4>How does Telconet approach today's market in Ecuador?</h4><p>We go after the customers who need more bandwidth in a more secure manner; that is our market. We are not very active on the low-end residential market, instead we are focused on the corporate market That being said today Megadatos through the Netlife brand is targeting the residential market with fiber optic to the home, and we provide services to Megadatos.</p><h4>How has the growth of internet speed transformed how Ecuador does business?</h4><p>It helped to reduce entry barriers to the cyber market. Most of our customers, direct and indirect, now have very good access to information, and now small producers can position and advertise their products. Many studies have tried to establish the relationship between broadband internet use and the national economy. Some suggest that it might be responsible for 1%-2% of GDP growth. The Minister of Telecommunications has provided an open field so that companies can provide their best services. As long as the government does that we will grow, but the minute the government tries to control the market, the nation will suffer. Some governments try to favor their state-owned companies, but this is short sighted because the whole country will suffer for the benefit of few.</p><h4>What kind of challenges are faced by an internet service provider in Ecuador?</h4><p>The municipalities now have broad powers to issue taxes on cables; we have identified five municipalities that charge unreasonable or wild sums for this. One small municipality has charged us $1.2 million for a small segment of fiber-optic cable. Even if you lawfully argue against it, they dismiss your arguments and order the banks to collect the money. We are actively trying to counter those unreasonable charges.</p><h4>What does Telconet do to invest in people?</h4><p>We provide people with training and funding for education, and we also finance 50% of their career. If there are courses directly connected to their work, we cover 100% of the cost. We spend perhaps one of the highest shares of total revenues in the industry on training.</p><h4>What are the differences in the way you need to approach the corporate and residential segments of the market?</h4><p>Of our total business, 75% is corporate and indirectly 25% is residential. We are the leader in the corporate market, and through the Netlife brand we expect the residential segment to become equally significant. In the corporate market you have to take care of every customer individually, as each has particular requirements that demand personalized attention. The residential component is a massive market where the focus is on the significant majority. You cannot be certain that everyone is satisfied with the service.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What would you say is the importance of the Pacific Refinery as a project for Ecuador's economy?</h4><p>The Pacific Refinery is the largest project in the history of Ecuador. The purpose of it is to meet the internal demand for hydrocarbons in Ecuador and export the extra. By doing this, the country will be saving over $4 billion that it now has to spend or invest in the importation of these products. The refinery will also provide some basic petrochemicals, which will trigger the development of the petrochemical industry in Ecuador, contributing through this aspect of the project to a change in the productive matrix. The petrochemicals scheduled for production around the refinery will be vital for the national economy.</p><h4>What is the current timeline for project completion?</h4><p>In June of 2013, a framework agreement was signed between the government of Ecuador and China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), one of China's largest oil concerns, and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), the largest bank in China and one of the most important worldwide. This framework agreement indicates that the refinery was originally set for the production of 300,000 barrels per day (bbl/d), and is to be constructed in two phases: one of 200,000 bbl/d and one of 100 000 bbl/d. A feasibility study has already been conducted for the 200 000 bbl/d phase. At the moment, we are at the final stages of concluding the financing for 70% of the project cost with ICBC. The project is estimated to cost around $10 billion. We are now working on the preparation of the shareholder's agreement, which will be Petroecuador with a 51% stake, CNPC with 30%, and PDVSA with 19%.</p><h4>What makes Chinese companies sound partners in this venture?</h4><p>The Chinese were willing to finance a project on this scale. Another important consideration was that the refinery specifications are internationally compatible with specific nations, and the licenses for the refinery are all American or European. Therefore, the refinery will be constructed with cutting-edge technologies. We will produce products that meet strict Euro 5 specifications. We will also contribute to the welfare of the people around the project because with the construction of the refinery, at the peak of construction we will employ over 20,000 workers. With the operation of the refinery we will employ around 1,300 workers.</p><h4>What is being done to meet the human capital challenge that comes with developing such a high-technology project?</h4><p>This is something that we have to do as the project leaders. We have to establish the workforce, by talking to the universities, firstly the local institutions, and then on a national level to source the skilled workers that will ultimately operate the refinery. We still have time for this, and are already taking care of the matter.</p><h4>How do you see the refinery developing the petrochemical industry in Ecuador?</h4><p>We will be providing the basic petrochemicals. Around the refinery, the government is implementing a Special Development and Economic Zone with the aim of attracting national and international companies to develop petrochemicals and pharmaceuticals. This will take the form of an industrial park, and the setting will provide the basic supplies for these companies, such as water and telephone communications. Companies will benefit from tax exemptions and ultimately the city of Manta and the province of Manabí­ will get a lot from this project.</p><h4>How will the refinery contribute to local development in Manabí­?</h4><p>We have been working solidly toward this, investing in social projects related to the refinery with the local communities. We have already supplied potable water to some of these communities, and are in the process of finalizing two health centers. We are also constructing a modern school for the neighboring community of El Aromo. We have thus far invested over $13 million, and have committed around $40 million specifically for the people around the Pacific Refinery. Environmental regulations in Ecuador are stringent and we have all the requisite licenses already in hand. We are diligently implementing the terms of the license.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has EP FLOPEC's role in the economy developed over the years?<br></h4><p>EP FLOPEC has transported hydrocarbons overseas to and from Ecuador. Considering that Ecuador's key export product is petroleum, EP FLOPEC has an important role in that strategic sector. At the beginning, we ensured that the oil shipping companies fulfiled the Ecuadorean regulations by controlling the suitability and technical conditions of the vessels. Subsequently, we were granted the exclusive right to transport hydrocarbons to and from Ecuador. In the Pacific, Ecuador is the largest petroleum producer exporting mainly to the Americas, but also to Asia and Europe. EP FLOPEC has expanded over the years to keep up with Ecuadorean petroleum production, purchasing and leasing additional vessels. In accordance with our strategic planning, EP FLOPEC has taken responsibility for 100% of hydrocarbons transportation, both in terms of exports and imports, until 2017. One of the major consequences of this has been the need to grow the fleet; therefore, EP FLOPEC continues in the process of developing commercial agreements with other companies to expand the capacity and efficiency of the company. Often, our ships make the return journey to Ecuador empty, and so today to ramp up efficiency we are combining the cargoes of various companies.</p><h4>How do you see the company developing looking ahead?</h4><p>EP FLOPEC's main responsibility is to transport 100% of Ecuador's crude exports, as well as its imports of refined petroleum products. As new projects occur a potential market is in process to transport clean petroleum products into Ecuador. EP FLOPEC is open to participate in other sectors too, for example when the mining industry begins to expand in Ecuador, we can also transport mining products. Actually, EP FLOPEC increased its participation in the regional market, not only with Ecuadorean products, but also with those of the region. The goal is to have a strong position in that market in the coming years. Currently, we already operate mainly in Panama, the US, Chile, Peru, and Colombia. Those countries require maritime transportation in tankers, so we are looking to reach an agreement to undertake this on their behalf. We also have business with Mexico, Canada, and others, for which we have commercial relationships with a range of companies.</p><h4>What are the challenges of expanding internationally?</h4><p>EP FLOPEC has operated in the market for over 40 years and we provide a reliable and first class service to our customers. Our challenges are to develop commercial agreements and strategic alliances with specific companies to increase our participation, and provide an adequate price structure to our potential partners. We are focusing on new segments to attend the large petroleum companies' needs, considering an adequate portfolio with own, leased and associate vessels. Finally, we are constantly committed to keep all ships well maintained, providing experienced and well trained crews, and keeping onshore personnel with high standards of service.</p><h4>Why is it important for Ecuador to have a public company playing this role?</h4><p>For Ecuador, hydrocarbons constitute a strategic commodity and EP FLOPEC's role falls on the expeditious and appropriate fleet to lift the oil in a secure and timely manner. To achieve this purpose, we have a law which allows State companies to provide the maritime transportation of hydrocarbons. Many countries in the world have the same regulations restricting maritime transportation. In the US for example, they have the Jones Act, which states that only ships built and owned by US companies, can move cargo within US ports. EP FLOPEC supports the local maritime industry, hiring Ecuadorean officers and crew on board our own ships, creating extensive jobs either on board and shore, such as agency services, husbandry or on ship chandler services. In addition, by the end of this decade, Ecuador is planning to develop a modern shipyard to build new tankers. EP FLOPEC will be the first secured and important customer in a position to put future orders on about 20 aframax tankers over the five first years. We will also engage in the maintenance of current and new ships. In this way, our company will support one of the new government projects with a strong impact on the economy, creating thousands of new jobs along the commercial and production chain.</p><h4>How do you see the Pacific Refinery changing EP FLOPEC's role in the economy?</h4><p>The new refinery is going to change the energy matrix in Ecuador, shifting our historical trend of oil exporters and product importers to be self-producers of clean products. This refinery will create a petrochemical industry and new opportunities to operate different sizes of ships in order to transport a diverse range of products.</p><h4>What role does EP FLOPEC play in Ecuador's efforts to change the productive and energy matrices?</h4><p>I think there are considerable opportunities to take advantage for EP FLOPEC. First of all, we will continue transporting all hydrocarbon requirements to and from Ecuador, in accordance with the new energy matrix and effects of the Pacific Refinery. We also have the opportunity to develop the Ecuadorean maritime industry by the support in the new shipyard. We are going to invest more than $400 million in this project and we are going to put orders for about 20 Aframax tankers. As per above, we are involved in the shift to make Ecuador an industrialized country, instead of a historically agricultural country.</p><h4>What is your vision for EP FLOPEC within Latin America and within Ecuador in 10 years' time?</h4><p>Now we have the opportunity to expand our goals, not only attending to our domestic needs, but also to take advantage of the market and increase our participation. Our vision consists of attending to 100% of the Ecuadorean market and holding 25% of the regional market; and leading tanker transportation in the Pacific basin in the next 10 years. The expansion plan also takes into account the diversification of services, such as into some port agency, oil storage facilities, and additional logistic operational businesses along the maritime transportation chain.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the Ministry of Electricity and Renewable Energy contributed to the transformation of Ecuador's energy matrix since its founding in 2007?<br></h4><p>Before 2007, there was no Ministry of Electricity and Renewable Energy in Ecuador to regulate this strategic sector of the economy. As a result, prior to 2007, the energy sector had experienced a number of complications, and in fact, was on the verge of collapse as a result of inadequate investment. This was exacerbated by the fact that a move toward privatizing the sector was hamstrung by legal uncertainties and internal complications. Therefore, in 2007, the Ministry was created to spearhead sector recovery and growth, which since then has been pronounced. In 2009, we saw a few problems in terms of poor supply, but those were basically related to the prior lack of investment. Starting in 2007, we set out a plan to swiftly reinvigorate the sector. The first idea was to take advantage of the country's huge water potential, which is why we conducted studies to build hydroelectric projects. Currently, Ecuador has eight large hydroelectric projects under development. At the same time as we developed these projects, it was necessary to invest in conventional thermal power generation using national fossil fuel reserves. Previously, thermal power generation had used imported fuels. We have developed nine thermal plants, with around 600 MW of capacity, as well as four hydroelectric plants of around 460 MW of capacity, in addition to the eight under construction. Finally, we have taken the important, symbolic step of developing a wind farm with a 16.5-MW capacity. Overall, we have achieved an increase of almost 1,100 MW in capacity over a very short period of time.</p><h4>What is the status of power consumption in the country's energy strategy?</h4><p>We have also been focused on improving efficiency in power consumption since 2007. The main segment of energy consumption in Ecuador is domestic; 35% of electricity consumed is residential, and this is where we have focused our attention. The first program involved the replacement of incandescent bulbs with compact florescent lamps and energy saving light bulbs. Today, incandescent light bulbs are no longer available in Ecuador as all bulbs are fluorescent. This is a high-impact project that involves a ban on the importation of incandescent lamps, which is key to managing energy consumption.</p><p>We have another ambitious project geared at getting people to use electricity for cooking instead of LPG, whereby the public would be both washing and cooking using renewable, domestically generated electricity. We are also working to replace inefficient refrigerators; we plan to replace 330,000 refrigerators in Ecuador. Finally, the other major axis has been to restore and strengthen the management of electricity companies' distribution and transmission systems. We have had problems in this area, especially relating to network losses and low revenue collection, and we have worked hard and we can now safely say that one of the great achievements of the national government has been the reduction of loss. When the government took office, the loss of electric power was above 22%, but with the efforts we have made the loss rate is now at 12.6%, and many international eyes are looking at what we have achieved in just a short period of time. Ecuador saves $20 million per year for each percentage point of reduction, which means that the country has saved hundreds of millions of dollars in lost electricity. We have substantially improved the issue of collection as well; we formerly had a recovery rate of 93% and now are at 98% or 99%. That's a more complex issue because the electrical distribution networks are very large and we have improved the quality of service. That is why we have worked throughout the electrical industry chain, meaning generation, distribution, and transmission, but also in energy efficiency.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the primary strengths of Ecuador's energy matrix?</h4><p>Ecuador has remarkable hydroelectric resources, which are of primary importance for the national matrix. The other energy resource is gas; either LPG or the natural gas from the coasts of Ecuador, Peru, or Monteverde. Fuel oil will be substituted by that gas and the energy produced by hydroelectric power. Meanwhile, another component of the energy mix is geothermal power.</p><h4>Do you see much potential for geothermal power in Ecuador?</h4><p>Definitely, and in fact the company is considering geothermal energy and has already initiated studies that have identified a number of prospects. CELEC EP is focusing its efforts on the development of four specific prospects, one located on the border with Colombia, and we expect to establish facilities with a total capacity of over 500 MW. This will bring us closer in scale to some of the largest geothermal power producers. In El Salvador for example, geothermal power represents 25% of total electricity production. We intend for geothermal power to meet around 10% of Ecuador's requirements.</p><h4>When we met with the Minister of Electricity he stated that Ecuador's goal was to raise the renewable energy component in total power production to 93% by 2016. What strategies are in place to achieve this goal?</h4><p>These are the numbers for hydro energy, and to date, there are eight hydroelectric projects in operation. CELEC EP has seven of them, and Coca has one. The total capacity of these projects exceeds domestic demand. We may be able to export this energy as a result. Currently, we are making arrangements for other projects. For example, the largest current project is the Coca Codo Sinclair Hydroelectric Project, with a planned capacity of 1,500 MW. We are now making arrangements for another hydroelectric project with even more impressive capacity of 6,000 MW. We have two projects in Zamora and Santiago, one at 3,600 MW and the other at 2,400 MW. In 2015, we will start the construction process, and when we talk about capacity, it is important to note that hydroelectric energy is not stationary, but variable. Sometimes, we may need to produce a certain amount of power by gas, or to import power from Peru or Colombia. We may be able to export power, but the fundamental idea is not to use oil to produce power.</p><h4>What contribution is CELEC EP making toward achieving energy independence?</h4><p>CELEC EP is an executive arm of the government. The minister decides on the policies to be implemented by the sector and on the timeframe, and CELEC EP works to achieve these. We set up, operate and, eventually, contract private companies. For example, in Mexico, the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE) is the only company in the country holding complete control of the generation, transmission, and distribution of power. However, CFE contracts quite a few private companies for the construction of its facilities and operations. CELEC EP utilizes a similar business model in the execution of these objectives. It is important to understand that the production and energy matrices are part of the same system. Within the productive matrix is the energy matrix, and within that is the electricity matrix, while within that in turn is hydroelectric power. When we say that we are increasing hydroelectric power to 93% of the total, it should be understood within this framework. If the productive matrix grows, and the energy and electricity matrices grow in turn, then 93% is proportionally greater than what it was before. We need to increase the share of electricity generation in the entire energy sector from 15% to 40%, which means cutting down on the share of energy required for transportation. Currently, the share used in the transportation sector is about 75% of total energy production.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role has your Ministry played in Ecuador's economic development in recent years?</h4><p>Ecuador's economy is doing well right now—you can see many new infrastructure projects such as roads, airports, and hydroelectric plants being built across the country. By 2016, we will have eight new electric plants operating in Ecuador thanks to the largest investment ever made in the country's history. The situation has changed so much that we even foresee Ecuador exporting electricity to the region by 2016. Some seven years ago, many areas in the country suffered from daily blackouts. The efforts of the public and private sectors to transform the energy system in the country have made this possible. We plan to become one of the leading producers of electricity in the world by 2016, and 93% of this electricity will come from hydroelectric plants. Also, it is important to mention that we already started the tender process for the first highway in Ecuador—the Santo Domingo-Esmeraldas highway. Regarding airports, as many as 21 have been renovated. One such infrastructure project that we can highlight is the Galápagos Airport, which is the first airport in the world to be run completely on renewable energy. On top of all this, we have to praise the political stability the country has attained over the last few years, because it has made possible the implementation of all these projects. We have also achieved the lowest unemployment rate in the history of the country, being one of the lowest in the region, too. Ecuador currently experiences growth rates above the average in the region, and we have controlled inflation.</p><h4>What role does the Production Code introduced by this government play in its efforts to change the production matrix in the country?</h4><p>The 2008 Constitution brought in the new Production Code, a regulatory and legal framework for productive industries in the Ecuadorean economy, which has also boosted the diversification of the economy, the country's export profile, the value-added of those products manufactured in Ecuador, and the inclusion of the private sector in the country's overall productive chain. Investments such as the Pacific Refinery, as well as in productive areas like metal and steel, energy, and shipbuilding, are ongoing efforts to change the productive matrix in the country. These have helped to bring the public and private sectors in Ecuador closer; there are over 400 companies that have stated their interest and willingness to increase production volumes and expand their export profile to contribute to such strategic efforts. There are both large- and medium-sized enterprises among these companies I mentioned. For example, three years ago Nestlé made the commitment to invest $450 million in Ecuador over five years. It wants to make Ecuador its operational base for exporting a wide range of local produce to other regional markets. We have seen interest from many multinational companies in establishing local production in order to reduce imports. In the next few years, we will also, for example, boost the consumption of ethanol as a fuel source for vehicles. To that end, we plan to increase sugar cane production to 36,000 hectares across the country, which will create increased job opportunities in the agricultural sector.</p><h4>How have you been working with the automotive industry to boost local production?</h4><p>We have been holding talks with many companies for this purpose, and we have seen interest from foreign companies planning to establish production operations in Ecuador. I believe that over the next few years we will have many more vehicles available in the market made with parts that have been produced in Ecuador. We want to increase efforts to introduce electric cars in Ecuador, and we have held talks with companies like Nissan to take advantage of our energy matrix and gradually incorporate electric vehicles into taxi fleets for example, as well as encouraging private consumption among the population. This first stage of a broader strategic plan would be followed by a second one in which we would assemble electric batteries in the country, and a third one in which we would actually assemble entire electric vehicles in Ecuador. The implementation of the second and third stages are subject to the success of the first stage. There are many more projects we foresee in this and other economic sectors over the medium term that are envisaged to contribute to the reduction of imports and the increase of exports in sectors and segments where the country has strong potential. We have to keep in mind that we are already a leading exporter of cacao, bananas, shrimp, wood for rafts, and many other products—most of them primary products.</p><h4>What role will innovation and projects such as Yachay play in the future development of Ecuador?</h4><p>Innovation will definitely play a major role, and the City of Yachay project is an important step toward the development of our R&amp;D capabilities. We hope to see the project taking important steps forward during 2014, a year in which we hope to attract investment to this area of our economy by sharing risks with those willing to invest. This would be a way to show our confidence and our conviction that what we do will definitely succeed. The City of Yachay will considerably improve our R&amp;D and scientific capacity in the near future; however, we expect the project to contribute in particular to fields such as nanotechnology and biotechnology. All in all, these initiatives are aimed at transforming the economy of Ecuador and boosting local production by generating greater value-added.</p><h4>What are the challenges that still face Ecuador in its efforts to transform the productive matrix?</h4><p>The challenges are many; however, we have started out on the right path. The experience of the so-called Asian tigers in transforming their own economies can be useful for Ecuador. We are convinced that we will continue to attract foreign investment into Ecuador, which should be another key driver in this process. However, as a challenge in this context, we have to make sure that these foreign investors promote the transfer of knowledge in their operations. Another challenge lies in ensuring that we properly reinvest the profits from Ecuador's natural resource wealth into the development of technology and human resources. We welcome all foreign investors, and invite them to consider the comprehensive list of incentives and the clear legal framework we have in place for their benefit. In this context, we are in a good position to become an entry point for Asian companies looking to expand into Latin America.</p><h4>What role can SMEs play in the transformation of the productive matrix?</h4><p>SMEs already play a hugely important role in our economy, and I believe this will only become more relevant in the near future. We have always said that nobody will be left aside in the transformation of the production matrix. In this context, the government is trying to provide an array of tools to aid their development. We are working to strengthen the ties between SMEs and the public sector in order to do this.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the current government effort to switch the country from gas stoves to electric stoves affecting your operations?<br></h4><p>It has been a temporary challenge for us at the moment, because we manufacture and sell gas stoves, and as a result,sales of these have fallen by 60%. However, we are participating actively with the government in this plan. We are ready for the production of electric stoves, and we will expand our portfolio in this industry. The transition is a good idea because subsidies for gas right now cost the government around $800 million a year. It is great for the country's economy, and it is popular as well. The way to do it is to offer people a new product that cooks better and is more efficient. We are willing to do it. The government over the past few years has been encouraging applicants to become more efficient. We have also been participating in making that the norm. In the past, an air conditioner probably broke down in six months. We want them to be more efficient.</p><h4>What would you say distinguishes Mabe products?</h4><p>We make sure all of our products are manufactured in a high-quality way, and our standards of production are high. Our plants are well positioned. We have local brands, and we have GE as a partner in Latin America.</p><h4>Which segment of the economy do see as the main driver of future growth for you in Ecuador?</h4><p>The low- to middle-income sector, as the mid-high sector is probably 10% of the market. Almost 70% of the market is the middle class, and their income per capita is on the rise. They want houses, appliances, and cars. Around 15 years ago, many people didn't have air conditioners or washing machines, and some didn't have fridges. The market has increased significantly over the past decade.</p><h4>How would you characterize the level of human capital in Ecuador?</h4><p>One of the things that makes Mabe special is its post-sales service. If you buy one of our products, you can be sure that the company will take care of it. People don't hesitate to buy any of our products. If there is a problem, we fix it. No questions asked. As far as the level of technical education, I think it has been increasing. When I hire someone for middle management, they all have a Master's degree, while 15 years ago you didn't see that. Now, everyone has undergraduate degrees and at least one Master's degree. Everyone is trying to speak a second language as well. I am 44 years old. When I graduated 29 years ago, I studied in the US when I had the opportunity. No one spoke English then. It is different now. People in their 20s all speak English. The level of competition has increased greatly. This is in the lower class as well. It's a different country.</p><h4>Why Ecuador as a destination for international investors?</h4><p>We came here in 1994. Since then, Ecuador has been an excellent operation for Mabe. Ecuador is a stable country with a good income per capita. It is a small country; however, if you compare it to a similar country like Guatemala, the income per capita here is much higher. Companies in Ecuador are much more profitable. It is a good country to do business in, but you have to know that the rules can change.</p>]]></richbody0content>

Telecommunications is a crucial tool that enables companies to optimize their time and resources and dedicate themselves to developing their core business without worrying about such activities as telecommunications</p><h4>Over the past seven years, the country has seen a profound economic transformation, with internet penetration jumping from 6% to 70%. How has this changed the internet business?</h4><p>In the past we lacked the tools to provide good coverage and could not reach all segments. With government support to develop telecommunications and create regulations, coverage in Ecuador today is good. We can provide internet to people and to companies with many kinds of systems, including satellite, fiber optic, wireless, copper cable, and more.</p><h4>How did that transformation change the way PuntoNet approaches the market?</h4><p>We have two different segments, each with a special focus. The first segment is home broadband. For this segment, PuntoNet created and implemented a large wireless network around Ecuador, building a dedicated product that was more cost effective than other methods. Our strategy was to form close relationships with our clients since in the early days many were unfamiliar with internet usage, perceiving it as largely a medium for entertainment. At that point, the government supported the use of the internet to develop and spread knowledge. Then, there is the corporate segment, where the key consideration is innovation and the renewal of technology. We want to give companies the entire IT infrastructure they need to facilitate the running of their business. Companies do not have to spend money on servers, or telephone systems, so we provide this. Our business is 65% corporate and 35% home clients. Our focus is on the corporates because by the nature of business they have the most urgent requirements. We are fourth in Ecuador in terms of corporate market share, but we do not count Claro or Telefonica because their core businesses are somewhat different from our own.</p><h4>How large is PuntoNet's network coverage, and what challenges have you faced in building network infrastructure from scratch?</h4><p>We have commercial offices in 13 cities, but provide 100% nationwide coverage of Ecuador. The difference is in the kind of technology employed in each city. For example, the Galápagos, being islands, exclusively have satellite coverage. In the key cities, we have a fiber-optic or wireless network. In the smaller cities, we only have a wireless network because its implementation is more convenient.</p><h4>What distinguishes PuntoNet from some of the larger names in the market?</h4><p>We are fundamentally different from other companies for two main reasons. Firstly, our service is easy to install. Other companies take between 10 or 15 days to activate. We can install it within four or sometimes three days. We also run campaigns with a same-day installation service. People do not like to wait, so this makes a real difference. Additionally, the larger companies have many internal processes and inevitable bureaucracy. We are a private company and it is a simple task for us to optimize the process. If I want to run a campaign this weekend in some neighborhood or other, I can offer to install the service the same day. It makes a big difference. Another thing is that we do not contract work out to third parties. We want to be a company that creates jobs, our entire team belongs to PuntoNet. We create a culture of belonging, and our employees are motivated to do the job right.</p><h4>What are your goals for Puntonet over the next five years?</h4><p>We have two goals. One is to keep a long relationship with our home clients. The other is to improve our relationships with our corporate clients and provide them with a greater range of tools so that they remain with us. I anticipate us becoming a large company recognized for its human talent and committed to its mission.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the role of Ecuador in Servientrega's international operations?<br></h4><p>Ecuador plays a major role in Servientrega's global operations, because it was our first experience abroad. This in itself is an important factor for our Colombian headquarters. We arrived in the Ecuadorean market 20 years ago (1994), at a time when the country enjoyed an oil boom, making it attractive for investment. It was in fact a situation reminiscent of what the country is enjoying today. Servientrega saw Ecuador as a strategic market to enter; it has similar characteristics to that of Colombia, whereby our competitive advantages offered new services to the market. On top of that, we share the same language, which also facilitates business.</p><h4>How have Servientrega's activities evolved since the dollarization of Ecuador?</h4><p>The country has evolved considerably since the establishment of local operations, and also in the light of political and social events. Over the past few years, the country has gained political, economic, and social stability, which has enabled companies to formulate longer-term strategies and better predict economic performance. This environment has strengthened us, as we gradually consolidated our operations in Ecuador. Over the years, we have learned to diversify our activity here, expanding to new segments. Also, rising purchasing power and the expansion of many economic sectors have helped us to increase our role in this market.</p><h4>What trends have you identified in the market over recent years?</h4><p>This is a transition period for Ecuador, an important moment in which it is set to show foreign markets the real competitive level and added value of its production. This production requires high-quality standards and competitive prices. The government implemented a strong program to substitute imports for local production that supports this transition process. This has caused some economic turbulence in terms of the performance of companies during 1H2014, which will gradually pick up during 2H2014. It is an ambitious plan that the government supports with tax and other legal benefits. This process took many market players by surprise, as they found they had no local alternatives, whereby many made strong short-term commitments.</p><h4>What role can the logistics sector play in the transformation of Ecuador's production matrix?</h4><p>Nowadays, a more integrated logistics industry with better products and solutions has allowed for a higher degree of specialization and professionalization in the sector. Many players have learned to adapt themselves to the real needs of clients. We have seen improvements in the quality of services, storage services, and cargo handling, and also in the utilization of technology. We have also seen an improvement in the human capital of not only this sector, but all sectors in general.</p><h4>What are the competitive advantages of Servientrega?</h4><p>We built the company from nothing, which means that we know in detail what we do and what our clients require. We provide personalized and integrated products and services to meet their demands and standards. We hold several ISO certificates. We have also started a specialization process to become a leading company offering solutions for the transport and distribution of hazardous substances and goods, as there is an interesting market niche there with a very low offering at present. This requires strong external preparation in terms of certification, licensing, and staff training. Currently, we are training our personnel, obtaining the pertinent environmental certificates and licenses, and preparing our facilities and fleet. We always prioritize the implementation of solutions according to what our clients need, as we develop an integrated plan along with them.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What motivated your entry into the Peruvian market?</h4><p>Red Eléctrica de España entered the Peruvian market in 1999 with Red Eléctrica del Sur (Redesur), our first local investment. That was a $74 million initial investment and we were in charge of the development of the transmission grid in the south of Peru, making the connection between Arequipa, Tacna, Moquegua, and Puno. Since then ours has proven to be an excellent operation and we enjoy a fruitful relationship with our customers, local agencies, the government, and the municipalities. In 2007 there was an amendment of the electricity laws in Peru that enabled new concessions through the Private Investment Promotion Agency (ProInversión). Since then we have taken part in all tenders opened by ProInversión. In 2010 we entered and won the tender to construct the Tintaya-Socabaya line, which has been in operation now since April 16, 2014. It was another successful project for us, free of any environmental, social, or security issues. We are now looking to build other new lines for the Peruvian government and are involved in new ProInversión tenders. Our ultimate aim is to become leaders in the operation of electrical systems in the south of Peru.</p><h4>What was the motive behind increasing your holding in Redesur with a Peruvian partner in 2013?</h4><p>Our Peruvian partner, AC Capitales, joined us in 2005, and since then we have been increasing our participation in the electrical market. Red Eléctrica de España owns a 55% stake and is also the strategic operator. Another 45% stake is owned by AC Capitales, which manages funds for investment in energy and natural resources. Together we have good experience and have been consolidating our investments in Peru. Now we are eager to carry our successful partnership on to future projects. We have a strong presence in the south, and good knowledge of the communities, geography, climate, and conditions, enjoying solid relations with governments and municipalities. Having said that, we also want to expand beyond the south throughout Peru, and today have the capacity to do so. Meanwhile, we are also keen to develop transmission lines for other agents besides the government, such as mining companies, generation utilities, distribution companies, or whatever might be required. We can also construct, operate, and maintain any transmission grid. We are interested in helping the government in other initiatives too, such as PPP projects.</p><div class="quote">“The optimum growth path in Peru involves participation in the periodically arising tenders and projects."</div><h4>What time frame do you envisage for growth in Peru?</h4><p>The optimum growth path in Peru involves participation in the periodically arising tenders and projects. The government and systems operators give you an investment framework for the next five years or so, based on a 10-year electricity transmission plan. The government then mandates ProInversión, which initiates the concession process. That is the chief manner in which we realize investments here in Peru.</p><h4>How will the government's new infrastructure projects handled by ProInversión, especially the two new gas-fired power plants being built in the south, affect your business?</h4><p>These new power plants will ensure much greater energy supply for the south of the country, which is an excellent prospect. These also mean that we will need more transmission grids to match the electrical offer with actual demand. The energy generated by gas generators has to be transmitted after all, which requires a grid in place, not just for the south of Peru, but also for other regions or else for export. Exporting energy is part of the government's plans. Once you have the transmission lines in place you can export and import on the same lines. That is what the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)-financed Andean Electrical Interconnection System (SINEA) Project aims to do; namely establish connections with neighboring countries, such as Ecuador and Chile, and eventually expand those connections to include Brazil, Colombia, and Bolivia. These are long-term investments that will do much to improve the electricity transmission and generation grid throughout the continent. Moreover, the cost of energy will be reduced leading to more efficient usage. And the system also works in reverse, whereby surplus energy is sold abroad, while during times of shortage it is imported. Red Eléctrica de España already has a strong pedigree in this field in Europe, where we have connected Spain, Portugal, Morocco, and France, including the use of submarine cables.</p><h4>Some players in the power industry have expressed concerns about the government-directed tender process for new power plants, particularly in that the market has not determined the pace of development. What are your views on this issue?</h4><p>It is a transparent process that is open to numerous players. The tenders have been determined based on the demand for power in the south, where diesel reserve power plants are being converted to gas turbine facilities based on government projections for future demand. These are long-term investments, both for the generators and the transmission lines. They take six or seven years to build, and are used for many more than that. The government, accordingly, has a long-term plan under which it determines what investments to undertake and what tenders to present to the market. In Peru, per capita energy consumption is 15 times below that of Spain. But the population is expected to increase their consumption, and industrial facilities are also planned. Peru is essentially a primary resource economy, but in the future the manufacturing industry and services sectors are expected to expand as the economy diversifies, which in turn will result in higher energy needs.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[The Most Important Motivation]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[the-most-important-motivation]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the reasons behind the establishment of the FAA?</h4><p>There were several strategic intentions behind the formation of the FAA, but we have three main justifications. Firstly, we want to raise the quality of talent within the industry. This is the most important motivation because, by establishing a quality structure, we can assure the quality of learning programs and certifications and raise standards in the long run. Secondly, we are looking to achieve a level of standardization because there are so many qualifications and training and education programs in the market all over the world. There need to be certain minimum standards that all the stakeholders can agree upon in order for us to move forward. Thirdly, we wanted to support the development, growth, and sustainability of the industry. The industry is growing, particularly Islamic finance, which has seen double-digit growth over the last 10-15 years. We are looking into sustaining the industry by having a continuous supply of quality people into the industry.</p><h4>What are the main benefits of FAA accreditation?</h4><p>Every stakeholder dealing with us will benefit somehow, for example the regulators. By having FAA accreditation, they can feel assured that the people practicing in the industry are professional, qualified, and certified. As far as the industry is concerned, FAA accreditation will raise the level of human capital development because we will be able to tell them whether or not their program meets international standards for best practices. In the long run, this will help to raise the quality of the people and encourage professionalism within the industry. For the professionals themselves, our accreditation and standards will allow them to develop further in their careers by helping them to increase their employability, or become more mobile, since being recognized here means being able to practice in another part of the world. For the training providers, their benefit is getting direct input from the industry players, because our assessors are industry players who are practiced and know what the industry wants. By providing that input, the providers can incorporate it into the structure, design, and development of their program. At the end of the day, all the stakeholders will benefit from our initiative.</p><div class="quote">“Every stakeholder dealing with us will benefit somehow, for example the regulators."</div><h4>How are you working to increase your recognition internationally and attract submissions from outside of Malaysia?</h4><p>That is part of our long-term plan. In order to promote this kind of initiative, you need to get strong buy-in from local and international players. There are many ways to do this and what we have done so far is to work closely with different organizations from around the world. We are working with professional associations and standards boards, for example the Islamic Standard Board (IFSB) in Kuala Lumpur and General Council for Islamic Banks and Financial Institutions (GCIBFI) based in Bahrain. We are also working with international quality assurance agencies, for example the Asian Pacific Quality Network (APQN). Also, we are working closely with regulators and central banks in different parts of the world and we accredit some top qualifications such as CFA and CISI. That is the way in which we are creating awareness in the market about the importance of our initiatives in raising the quality of talent. In the long run we will work hard on our promotion, engagement, and corporate relationship.</p><h4>Are you looking to form further partnerships?</h4><p>We are looking into a few important markets in Central Asia, for example Kazakhstan will be one of our targets. In addition we are looking into North Africa and have specifically developed some of our standards in French. We are also looking into some countries in Africa such as Tanzania, and of course we are working closely with our neighboring countries like Brunei, Indonesia, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Thailand. Recently we also had a few discussions with several institutions in Hong Kong and we would like to make Hong Kong our base for a larger market in China.</p><h4>How is the FAA working to increase the competitiveness of Islamic Finance?</h4><p>One way that we would like to increase the competitiveness of the Islamic finance industry is by providing a high level of professional service that is on a par with or even better than that of conventional banking, which has been established for hundreds of years. They have a very complicated system with a high level of service. So we need to meet this by raising the standard of service and developing more unique and creative products, which is another issue for Islamic financing. Leadership is also very important in this industry and we are pleased to be in Malaysia because we can lead this initiative. We would like to promote Islamic Finance further into other parts of the world, especially to those countries that have interest in developing such a model for their financial services industry. I believe Malaysia can play this leadership role and indirectly the FAA will be able to assist when it comes to producing quality talent.</p><h4>What do you think is the overall role of Islamic finance in the development of Malaysia?</h4><p>Islamic finance is already very important, and it will increasingly become a major component of our economy. This will contribute to Malaysia's vision of becoming a developed country by 2020. This will give a lot of opportunities to the workforce and create a lot of business, which we can export and develop in other parts of the world. For example, some of our multinational banks, such as Maybank and CIMB, already have operations in many other countries, offering Islamic finance services in Indonesia, Brunei, and even London and Hong Kong. That is how we link the overall development of Islamic finance to the development of Malaysia. Furthermore, Malaysia will play a role as the hub of Islamic finance, promoting this business model to other parts of the world, not exclusively the Muslim world. For example, Malaysia is the second largest investor in London, which is very interested in exploring Islamic finance as a financial instrument to further develop the city. Islamic finance is not about religion but rather about a different business model that can bring benefits and allow further development. And Malaysia is happy to share this.</p><h4>How do you think standardization in accreditation can be achieved?</h4><p>This is one of our long-term goals. What we have already produced is a learning standard that was developed by the industry and which needs to be incorporated into the university curriculum. Secondly, we are working to strengthen the industry's role, for example when it comes to students undertaking work experience in their final year. Thirdly, we would like more people from the industry to work and teach at the university level. Through these three things we are hoping to achieve some level of coordination and collaboration between the universities and industries. The FAA comes in to help facilitate this bridge, which is why we also invite industry players and professors to our assessment and development meetings. In this way, professors can understand the aspirations, intentions, and needs of the industry and at the same time it allows the industry to understand the role of the universities, which are trying to produce holistic graduates. This is our vision and we have started doing it. In 2015 we will start working closely with universities and the regulators. We will invite all the business schools in the country, and Bank Negara and the Securities Commission will also come to work with them and provide them with the latest updates so these can be incorporated into the universities' curriculum.</p><h4>How does the enhancement of human capital play into Malaysia Vision 2020?</h4><p>In order for Malaysia to become a fully developed country in line with Vision 2020, the government had to identify a few critical pillars; the one closest to us is human capital. You need to have innovative and creative people because most of the developed countries in the world have created a lot of things through innovation and creativity. Development is highly dependent on talent and we need talent in the country in order to support long-term growth. This is very much in line with what we are currently doing; producing quality talent. It is about high quality rather than quantity of talent, which is why we are trying to build the bridge between industry and the universities and also trying to enhance professional training of our certification. Learning should not stop after people have graduated; once in the industry, people should still go through continuous education and learning in order to be able to innovate and come up with creative ideas and solutions. That is why practitioners are required to have a Continuous Professional Education (CPE) program, which assures the continuing relevance to the needs of industry. By having that we are quite positive that we will be able to achieve Vision 2020, even though it is in only five to six years' time. The government is working hard, as are we at the FAA, to achieve this.</p><h4>Where do you see FAA in the medium term?</h4><p>We already have our five-year road map and now we are in the process of developing our second phase for 2017 and beyond. One thing that is very clear in our minds is that we would like to be the central point of reference when it comes to the development of quality talent and show the direct impact of this initiative to the bottom line of the industry, which in this case is profit. In the next two to three years we will be able to provide advisory services to the government and professional bodies in the industry. When they talk about quality talent, we will be the central point of reference because we have all the necessary methodologies, standards, processes, and resources in place.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The UK is the largest foreign investor in Oman. How would you assess economic and trade relations between the two nations?</h4><p>The UK and Oman enjoy excellent economic and trade relations built on deep foundations of friendship and trust. We have been trading for some 400 years. There has always been a long-term and sustainable approach to investment from both sides, and a good example of this is the 30-year agreement signed at the end of 2013 that will see BP invest $10 billion to develop the Khazzan gas field.  The scale of UK investment in Oman is a clear sign of just how close our economic links are. According to recent figures, approximately 40% of FDI into Oman is from the UK. Furthermore, the two-way trade between Oman and the UK surged ahead by 17.5% to £671 million in 2013, over the previous year, mainly on account of growth in the UK's exports to the Sultanate. We hope that the recent launch of the Electronic Visa Waiver program for Omanis wishing to travel to the UK encourage further trade by making it easier for Omani businessmen to travel to the UK. The scheme means that Omanis can travel to the UK without the cost and inconvenience of obtaining a visa, instead simply filling in an online form. We greatly welcome the appointments in recent months of two new Co-Chairs of the Oman British Friendship Association (OBFA), which is the bilateral business council: on the Omani side, His Excellency Maqbool Sultan, the greatly respected former Minister of Commerce and Industry, and on the British side Sir Sherard Cowper-Coles, a former senior diplomat with huge experience in the Middle East, who is now senior adviser to HSBC's Group CEO.</p><h4>Why is Oman an attractive destination for UK investment?</h4><p>Oman's stability gives UK investors great confidence. The strength and warmth of the bilateral relationship and our long trading history add to the attraction. Oman's infrastructure and development as a logistics hub through ports, rail, and road construction and expansion coupled with a choice of free trade zones offer a good mix for UK investors. Oman is a prosperous country with a young and ambitious population. Its policies on economic diversification and private-sector development create opportunities for the UK to support and partner in the many innovative companies and industries that are being created as a result.</p><div class="quote">“The UK and Oman enjoy excellent economic and trade relations built on deep foundations of friendship and trust."</div><h4>What areas of bilateral trade have the most potential for growth?</h4><p>As Oman continues to put a lot of effort into increasing connectivity, through seaports, airports, and road and rail infrastructure, we expect companies from the UK, which has a long history in logistics and developing railway lines, to be involved in these projects throughout. The UK's competences are well regarded in areas such as security systems, operation, maintenance, management, training, and inter-modal transport facilities. I also believe there will be great potential for growth in the healthcare sector, where major new projects will present opportunities for long-term partnerships in specialist healthcare areas. The continued drive for private sector growth and job creation in Oman has created demand for education and training services, an area in which the UK has long been active in Oman and enjoys an excellent reputation. There will of course be many areas of potential growth for Omani investment in the UK. The UK is one of the world's most competitive places for investment management, as well as being a hub for finance raising. We would hope to see Oman choosing the UK as its preferred partner in both of these areas.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess bilateral ties with Panama?</h4><p>We have enjoyed excellent bilateral ties with Panama since 1929. Today, 97% of our trade exchange concerns chemical and pharmaceutical products. This is in itself a great opportunity, as over the years this trend has opened the door to new trade and business opportunities for both countries. Our collaboration has gone also beyond these fields, and we have exported Puerto Rican services such as engineering training and infrastructure development. This experience has proven highly positive, and we currently also extending these activities to Colombia and Peru.</p><h4>How has the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) signed between Panama and the US impacted the Puerto Rican economy?</h4><p>Recent studies show that as regional economies expand, so too does Puerto Rico's presence in their trade balance. Therefore, at a time of economic flourishing in Latin America, Puerto Rico is faced with numerous opportunities to expand its economic ties with these countries, while also diversifying its industrial output. Puerto Rico is a natural bridge to the US for many Latin American countries. Over the past couple of years, we have strengthened trade and logistics ties with Europe and Latin America, and have seen several European companies establishing operations in Puerto Rico to reach the US and Latin America.</p><div class="quote">“Recent studies show that as regional economies expand, so too does Puerto Rico's presence in their trade balance."</div><h4>Apart from the pharmaceutical industry, what other strategic sectors does your government aim to develop?</h4><p>We are in the process of diversifying our economy. Agriculture and textile manufacturing have been two traditionally strong sectors in Puerto Rico that we need to revive. Meanwhile, chemical products and medical devices are two segments with the potential to boost our economic diversification. Currently, 48% of our economy depends on manufacturing activities, and we are well aware of the need to diversify to foster a more dynamic economy. In this context, we have taken positive steps within the aerospace industry, as exemplified by Lufthansa. These efforts have also enabled us to attract software production activity related to this industry. The main multinationals in this sphere are present in Puerto Rico, which is significant. They create many job opportunities for our people, and as a country we have been fortunate enough to witness a shift toward R&amp;D activities and broader innovation in our economic activity. Meanwhile, the role tourism plays in the economy is increasing considerably, amid ever-greater arrivals. We attract many cruise companies into the country, while over 1,000 additional beds are imminently scheduled for addition to Puerto Rico's touristic offering. On a related and positive note, we have reduced crime rates by over 20% since I began my tenure as governor.</p><h4>What have been your main landmark achievements since you assumed the position of Governor of Puerto Rico?</h4><p>Puerto Rico is set to pass its first balanced budget in 22 years. This will enable us to allocate more resources toward generating greater employment opportunities. We are also in the process of achieving a diversified industrial base for our economy. Chemical and pharmaceutical products, the aerospace industry, and the software production sector are three fields set to play a key role in our economy in the near future. Meanwhile, we need to transform our agricultural sector into a more efficient endeavor, and also renovate our tourism offering. These elements will enable us to become a more competitive economy in the region and the wider world.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[all-hands-on-deck]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>When and why did Diageo decide to enter the Mozambican market?</h4><p>Until July 2012, Diageo had no direct presence in the country. We have a long relationship with our distributor, CICOTI, which has a large portfolio and was giving us access and understanding of the market. I deployed in July 2012 and, by January 2013, we knew this was the right place to be. We created a company in Mozambique and by August 2013 we had bought Lusomoc Ltda, which was not performing at the time, and which we then renamed Diageo Supply Marracuene Limited (DSML). We immediately got all hands on deck to see how we could produce spirits in an affordable format to explore more opportunities in the mainstream spirits market, without compromising our values as a responsible producer of quality drinks. We started production in July 2014 through an innovative facility called The Cube, and launched two brands with three different formats. This is a plant shipped in containers, which is tested and then shipped to the destination and assembled. We offer Gilbey's Gin, in 75cl and 25cl format, as well as a premium branded spirit, Master's Choice, in 20cl format. We then started producing Smirnoff Spin in late November 2014. We run our plant with a 100% local team, which was trained to the highest global standards. We took them to South Africa for two weeks and then to Ghana for a further week, where we have a similar production unit for spirits. They are an excellent team, and are fully committed to the success of our company. They are experts in producing top-quality beverages safely and efficiently. I am glad to say we have had zero accidents at the company, of which we are duly proud.</p><h4>What was the investment made here and what is the production capacity?</h4><p>Currently, the investment is nearing $20 million. We employ 35 direct full-time staff with many more who are indirectly employed. In terms of capacity, we designed the plant to be able to handle the volumes we anticipate needing in the near future, and we have room to grow within this. Meanwhile, we are committed to expansion and will be introducing new brands and expanding our local portfolio, as well as securing Mozambique as a base for exports.</p><div class="quote">“Our Master Bartender Academy has trained over 300 bartenders across Mozambique in responsible drinking."</div><h4>What demand is there for your products in Mozambique?</h4><p>The growth of mainstream spirits is somehow limited by the large number of competitors out there selling in extremely small formats and at exceptionally depressed prices. We believe this to be unsustainable in terms of quality and consumer choice, as well as from a legislative perspective. Indeed, the government of Mozambique has been proactive in protecting the consumer, and there is new legislation regulating the sale, marketing, and production of alcoholic drinks. We believe the market will formalize and diminish in size; however, it will increase in terms of quality and affordable quality choices, and we want to lead that change. Our greatest challenge regarding imported spirits is the large volume of product that flows in from various origins, sometimes over borders, without correct duties being paid, whereby the products become widely and cheaply available. We are working with the authorities on this because we believe that Mozambique is losing revenue and we, as a company, are missing the potential to invest and grow further and faster in Mozambique.</p><h4>How do you promote responsible drinking?</h4><p>The government has been investing heavily in infrastructure, education, and health, and we are an active part of the healthcare solution by continuing to promote responsible drinking. We want to make alcohol affordable, but also to promote it in appropriately. Our Master Bartender Academy has trained over 300 bartenders across Mozambique in responsible drinking. We shared that program with the Ministry of Health, which was highly supportive, and we are constantly driving the message in all of our initiatives and training events.</p><h4>What role would you like to play in the socioeconomic development of the country?</h4><p>We are keen to contribute in many areas, from health and education to the sustainable economic development of Mozambique. On the health side, we have a project called Water of Life. We brought it about in partnership with the EU and several donors. Over the past few years, we have been investing considerably, having focused on supporting access to safe drinking water. We have provided access to clean water to 46,000 people in Mozambique alone, as well as sanitation for over 55,000 people. We have trained people in sustainable community efforts, such as hygiene, rubbish collection, and water drainage, among others, to over 100,000 people. We are also looking to start a graduate program to bring people directly from universities to our company, by investing in their training and ongoing development.</p><h4>How do you assess the business environment in Mozambique?</h4><p>There are several challenges remaining from the prior lack of economic development and an abundance of legislation, which needs to be streamlined and simplified. Yet it must be said that there is an absolute willingness to build business, both among the government and the population. People want stability, jobs, and the opportunity of a better life for their children—better education, better food, and better products and brands. We are finding a real desire from the government to receive investors and from the average Mozambican to train, work hard, and invest in their own development.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What factors account for Nigeria facing a housing deficit estimated at 17 million to 23 million homes, and how does the Ministry aim to reduce this deficit?<br></h4><p>First and foremost, let me say that the figure of 17 million is yet to be ascertained. We have instituted a committee to take a proper census so that we can be certain about the housing deficit we have. Having said that, addressing your question, several socio-economic and political factors have led to the huge housing deficit in the country. For the most part these include rapid population growth and the rapid influx of our population into urban areas from rural communities in search of greener pastures, the low-income capacity of many who want to own their own houses, and the high cost of housing inputs. Other factors are the low priorities accorded urban planning and good urban governance leading to housing shortages, high land values and the cost of building materials, and the proliferation of slums. It is, however, in recognition of the fact that these multi-faceted problems need to be addressed that the Government decided to establish the Federal Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban Development as a free-standing Ministry in April 2010. It is the umbrella policy arm of the federal government with the sole aim of ensuring adequate and sustainable housing delivery and maintenance of a conducive living environment that would meet the needs and aspirations of Nigerian citizens. Fundamentally, the Ministry was established to reduce the housing deficit through the development of both the National Housing and National Urban Development Policies respectively. These are presently been actualized through an inclusive and participatory process involving all relevant stakeholders in the built environment in general.</p><h4>How will the Ministry mobilize private sector funds to provide sufficient capital outlay for housing development?</h4><p>Right from the time of its establishment, the Ministry has been in the process of mobilizing the private sector by engaging its two parastatals, namely the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria (FMBN), and the Federal Housing Authority, as well as through Public Private Partnership (PPP) arrangements, and the Nigeria Mortgage Refinance Company (NMRC) which was officially launched by the President on January 16, 2014 to increase mortgage penetration in the country. The Ministry is collaborating with the Coordinating Minister for the Economy/Minister of Finance to ensure the effective launch of the project. Furthermore, I am happy to say that our determination to attract sufficient capital outlay for housing development has been boosted by the large number of competent developers and builders that have shown interest in participating in the process of mass housing delivery programs. And this has been coupled with a positive response from Nigeria's State governments with respect to the provision of unencumbered land for the construction of mass housing projects in the country. Attesting to this is the fact that we have received confirmation of the provision of land from 14 States, as well as the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, for the start of the mass housing delivery program in the country.</p><h4>How do you envisage the role of the Ministry as the industry regulator and facilitator?</h4><p>The key functions of the Ministry that have been consolidated over time through our mandate, include the formulation of policies and setting of standards. Our role also includes coordination of activities in the sector, providing oversight, monitoring the implementation of policies, and enforcing compliance with regulations and standards. The Ministry is also involved in the provision, upgrading, and maintenance of housing stock infrastructure, including Federal ministries' public buildings and the promotion of sustainable development of livable, functional, and productive towns and cities. The Ministry also supports State governments in the realization of the National Strategic goals in the housing and urban development sectors, and above all the forging of partnerships with key stakeholders, including the organized private sector and development partners to advance the national agenda on effective land administration and management.</p><h4>One of the goals of President Jonathan's National Transformation Agenda is the delivery of one million homes annually to Nigerians over the next five years. How will the Ministry achieve this and how do you assess the current progress in this regard?</h4><p>The mass housing delivery program is one of the major goals of the present administration. Under the Transformation Agenda and the President's National Vision 20:2020, the provision of accessible and affordable housing is one of the strategic national imperatives designed to guarantee the well-being and productivity of Nigeria's citizenry. It is in the quest to achieve this that the Government has come up with a plan to build a million houses in the next few years. The Ministry will achieve this by mobilizing the private sector to key into the program. We are already receiving proposals from both internal and foreign organizations who want to bring their resources and expertise in to drive this program. The Ministry is also liaising with State governments and authorities to provide unencumbered land for this program.</p><h4>What opportunities does the Ministry offer to foreign firms who are interested in supporting the Ministry's mission to ensure adequate and sustainable housing delivery, as well as the maintenance of an acceptable living environment for every Nigerian?</h4><p>Opportunities abound in this sector and they are not only for Nigerians. There are also opportunities for foreign firms through the Ministry's international cooperation policy which is aimed at fostering closer cooperation for building institutional capacities and addressing the developmental challenges of sustainable land administration and management, affordable housing and urban development in Nigeria, as well as funding innovative solutions to common challenges. Some of our international foreign collaborators include the World Bank, the Department for International Development (DFID), Cities Alliance, Shelter Afrique, and the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat), to mention just a few. Furthermore, our major areas of cooperation include, but are not limited to, policy development and strategy; institutional exchanges and linkages; and property development, such as public housing home ownership schemes and estate renewals. We are also cooperating on new construction methods through the application of technology; and housing maintenance and services, including facilities management, housing finance and new building materials exploration. Data gathering, processing and management, including security and tracking; as well as capacity building, including ICT training, professional development, and artisanal vocational training are other areas where we are collaborating. Urban planning and new town/city development; infrastructure development; the twinning of cities; and last but not least, investment promotion and facilitation, are all important areas of work for us too. In a nutshell, this is some of what we have been doing in the Ministry as part of the President's Transformation Agenda in the housing and urban renewal sector to address and redress the deficit of more than 17 million homes in the country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

We have participated in many projects nationwide, including the building of roads, stadiums, high-rise buildings, and many other civil engineering projects. Abinitio Ceezali committed herself to operating within the best global practices with a strong inclination to quality and prudent financial management of her projects. We also give serious attention to the impact of our projects on the environment by keeping our operations environmentally friendly.</p><h4>What is the nature of your collaboration with the government?</h4><p>Ceezali is collaborating with the government in various areas of infrastructure development. For instance, after a three year highly competitive bidding process, our company was selected as the successful bidder for the provision of integrated engineering infrastructure to Mabushi District in Abuja under a PPP arrangement. This project is one of the major infrastructure development projects that the Federal government is embarking on. We are delighted that the government has accepted the PPP contract arrangement as a veritable alternative for procurement, so that we are able to quickly close the big gap in the country's infrastructure deficit.</p><h4>What kind of support do you expect from the government, apart from PPPs?</h4><p>One of the major areas where the government can offer support to the industry, and especially indigenous companies, is to facilitate and guarantee access to long-term funds to enable them to have adequate resources to operate effectively. Another area is that of tax waivers and import duties on capital assets that will be employed in delivering vital infrastructure projects in Nigeria.</p><h4>How do you apply the best practices in corporate governance, social responsibility, and security management?</h4><p>Ceezali is a corporate member of the British Safety Council and we are committed to keeping people safe and healthy at work. We also operate one of the best codes of practice by giving equal opportunity and fair treatment to our valued stakeholders. Before embarking on projects, we hold a stakeholders' forum where interests are identified, discussed, documented, and executed. We also maintain a cordial relationship between employees as we consciously build in them an "ownership mentality". Our company is socially responsible to the host community as we give back to the society values that will impact the life of the people. You will be shocked to know that "quality service" is a good value to the people in FCT and Nigeria as a country because it is scarce to get such value from the indigenous contractors. We have built hospitals and clinics, and provided portable water to people in the community where we operate.</p><h4>You have recently taken on a new project, the building of a 16-km dual carriage roadway in Kogi State, the Ganaja-Otokiti. Could you elaborate on that?</h4><p>This is one of the several publicly significant projects we will be handling. As a public interest entity, Ceezali is strongly committed to making its contribution to the development of the urban and local communities, which explains why we took up the project. Lokoja is a river and rock locked town with huge traffic challenges. The Ganaja-Otokiti narrow dual carriage ring road is the answer to decongesting the traffic in the capital. This effort requires a committed company to undertake such a project considering the issue of timely delivery and the cost implications. The building of this road will enhance the speedy development of residential and commercial spaces through the construction of real estate and public facilities, thus creating new work places and generating employment for the teeming youth of the state.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[promoting-peace-of-mind]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What reasons are the reasons for the low insurance penetration in Nigeria?</h4><p>The National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) came into law in 1999. Then in 2005 the federal government commenced its formal sector programs, which involved health insurance coverage for federal government workers nationwide. Since then, 10% of federal workers' salaries have gone into the scheme. We also have a program to address the specific needs of pregnant women and children under the age of five, having thus far covered approximately 4 million people. Having said that, of those 4 million lives, only 1.9 million are being taken care of right now under the scheme. The NHIS' total coverage is about 8 million people in both the formal and the informal sector programs, but it is still voluntary. Health insurance is hard to enforce as you are asking someone to pay for something that they do not need immediately, and that is not legally mandatory for anybody. This leaves us with a significant need for advocacy and marketing. In 2013, the President directed us that we should cover at least 30% of Nigerians by the end of 2015. We actually set a target of 40% ourselves and have developed our strategy for reaching that. We hired the consulting firm PwC to help us rework the processes. Based on their report, we have been able to achieve considerable mileage over the past few months. Firstly, we have restructured and refocused our department, especially in terms of marketing. Secondly, we have set up offices in every state of the country. That has manifested positively, because we have increased our coverage by two to three million since January 2014. Beyond that, we came up with our own four-point strategy for leapfrogging. First, we launched a community-based health insurance scheme that mainly addresses the needs of poor people in our area and in the informal sector of the economy. From October 2014, we will be enrolling all 24 million pupils in public primary schools nationwide. We have also enrolled students in tertiary institutions nationwide, which amounts to roughly 2.9 million. Beyond that, we have just launched mobile health insurance. Nigeria has the highest mobile phone per capita ratio in Africa, and we are leveraging that penetration. In 2013, all Nigerians owning a mobile phone were targeted by our scheme. The benefits of the platform are numerous. People can register and access it from anywhere in the country as long as they have a mobile network. It is also a convenient payment platform. You can pay NGN12,000 once a year, NGN1,000 monthly, or NGN250 weekly. With this you have a guarantee of protection against at least 80% of the diseases in this environment. That is what we are trying to achieve. We also have an adoption platform, with which we tap into our innate sociology in Nigeria. You can pay for your loved ones or for anybody else. This platform is so robust that you can be specific and refer to your loved ones, or non-specific (meaning random vulnerable people). We have close to 1 million Nigerians ready to be adopted, and expect 5 to 10 million adopters. If we look at the facility level, the story is also that of success. We have accredited more than 7,000 health facilities nationwide, and intend to accredit an additional 3,000 before the end of 2014. All of these facilities will be provided with the necessary telecommunications equipment to be in contact with health organizations in real-time, whereby the health organizations will be able to monitor the facilities and interact with them.</p><h4>How are you tapping into the informal workforce?</h4><p>The community-based health insurance is a platform where we enroll people in rural areas. These people usually have one thing in common; either a religious or healthcare facility not too far from them. We use that to gather them together and interact with them and we lead them to one facility in the environment, which we call a mutual association. All the men and women in the informal sector belong to cooperative societies, which are governed by a national body. In partnership with this national body we enroll them through the empowerment process. The cooperative empowers them, and then negotiations are made for health insurance. So we are expanding the community-based health insurance to that level. There is another group, broken up into four sub-groups, that we are meeting with right now, namely road transport workers; a sector of around 16 million people. We want to enroll this group for community-based health insurance.</p><h4>What is your take on the development of the health sector over the coming five years?</h4><p>One has to look at infrastructure, manpower, and materials to service the scheme. But the single most important thing is the ability to pay for services, which will create demand that in return increases supply. Because we are creating demand, our facilities will improve, new facilities will be built, and people will have the confidence to invest in the health sector because they are assured that payment for their services will deliver real outcomes. I strongly believe that the health sector in Nigeria will be able to move to a national position of being among the first-rate economies of the world. I also expect the health sector to be competing at that level within another five years going by what we are doing. The beauty of this is that we are working at a level of public-private partnership. We are involving Nigerians in the various sectors by assisting them to come together and work out a plan for themselves even without adjusting the legislation. Even when on a voluntary basis, we utilize all available materials to penetrate the various segments of society to make health insurance more embracing, and have had a positive response to this.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-real-deal]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you tell us what NAFDAC does and how it has improved public health since its inception?<br></h4><p>Through our broad mandate, the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) regulates all packaged food, and all drugs, cosmetics, chemicals, and even bottled water; essentially overall one third of the products that make up the Nigerian economy. With our regulations, we have been able to boost local business, and have promoted exports of value added agricultural products to other countries too. We have also been able to create jobs, stimulate industry, and encourage different countries to come and invest, especially in the areas of the products we regulate. Recently we have been able to get the mutual approval of some of our medical manufacturing facilities here.</p><h4>A couple of years ago, the drug industry in Nigeria suffered so heavily from counterfeit products that even neighboring countries refused to import from you. In contrast, today you are exporting drugs to Denmark. What explains this change?</h4><p>The quality of the medicines did not meet required standards. For example, a 2008 WHO survey showed that more than 64% of the Nigerian antimalarial drugs were either counterfeit or sub-standard. That has dropped to 19.6% today. Nigeria has responded quickly and made its companies manufacture drugs that are certifiably life-saving products.</p><h4>How do you keep sub-standard or counterfeit products out of the market?</h4><p>We deploy a diverse, but well-coordinated approach. First and foremost we closely monitor products in conjunction with consumers and security agencies. We involve the consumer and the security agencies to closely monitor products. Nigerian customs and other border control agencies, too, have evolved, as has the standard of regulation and administration. The Nigerian police force, which has developed its monitoring of product quality, has contributed positively, and we engage with all sectors of the economy and educate the youth to work toward our common goal. Identifying counterfeit products has become a complicated process due to technological advances. Former drug barons have reinvested their resources into the manufacturing of counterfeit medicines as a result of the recent crackdown on the illicit narcotics trade. The global market of counterfeit medicines today is worth between $75 billion and $200 billion annually. We have attempted to counter their sophistication by teaching our staff to use scanner equipment that can identify counterfeit medicines on the spot. We are the first country in the world to use this to identify medicines. To help the Nigerian consumer detect fake drugs, we have employed a mobile detection service too, and all drugs must contain an ID code, which is then verified via mobile phone. This enables consumers to check medicines on the market, and secondly, it shows us the areas of the country with an abundance of fake products.</p><h4>What are the targets for NAFDAC over the coming five years?</h4><p>First of all, I would like to see more Nigerian companies getting WHO approval. I hope to see Nigeria becoming self-sufficient in the supply of essential medicines that are needed, especially for public health programs. We will be working to reduce maternal and newborn deaths in Nigeria. If we can make most of these products readily available for the Nigerian market, accessible, and at an affordable price and used in the right quantities, we are going to reduce maternal deaths and childhood mortality in the short time. Zinc sulphate is being manufactured for the management of diarrhea, and we are beginning to manufacture dispersible amoxicillin tablets for management of pneumonia in children as well as injectable antibiotics. In short, numerous products are being manufactured locally, with more available to those who need them. The chemicals and the water business are being regulated such that most water-borne diseases are being reduced. By extension public health will be significantly improved, as will the economy, in such a way that foreign investors will find Nigeria a more appealing address overall.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Ç¼LEX was established in 2004 as the result of a merger of four leading commercial law firms. Could you elaborate on the services that Ç¼LEX provides in different sectors of the economy?<br></h4><p>The firm was established by aggregating specialists in various practice areas, featuring aviation, tax, oil &amp; gas, corporate &amp; commercial, litigation, capital markets, and energy, amongst others. We have since been honoured to advise clients across these various disciplines. The Firm's lawyers have also developed specialist skills and gained significant deal experience from their involvement in transactions and projects. Our expertise covers legal, regulatory and policy issues, as well as commercial, fiscal and environmental issues in the sectors we serve. We are committed to keeping abreast of matters affecting the constantly changing business and regulatory environment in which our clients operate. Our local knowledge and our regular interaction with key players in the sectors we operate in allow us to structure our advice on projects and transactions in anticipation of, and consistent with, changes in policy and regulation.</p><h4>Ç¼LEX has a proven track record, as confirmed by the number of awards the company has received over the years. What is the essential driver of its success?</h4><p>Having a problem solving approach to client matters, and attention to detail immediately come to mind.</p><h4>The firm's clients are predominantly multinational companies. What makes Ç¼LEX such an attractive partner for these companies?</h4><p>The attributes earlier mentioned are fundamentally important. In addition there is scale and geographical coverage. Multinational companies also look to take advantage of the scope of practice of a firm.  Ç¼LEX has three offices in three different geopolitical zones of the country and another office in Accra, Ghana. We employ more than 50 lawyers with an amazing aggregate of over three centuries of legal experience.</p><h4>From a legal perspective, what trends will you keep a close eye on in the Nigerian economy in 2015?</h4><p>There is, of course, the upcoming general election, which may usher in a new administration. Professionals and investors alike are closely observing the election, not because a new administration will change the national direction, but because the style of administration may vary. Over the past 20 years the country has been moving from state control of the economy and business toward private sector control. Not so long ago government controlled the four largest banks in the country, while today all banks are in private hands, except for development banks. Telecoms, too, was also wholly under government ownership, but now the state controls less than 1% of that industry. The power industry is in the process of being privatized. Air transportation moved from government control to private many years ago and is flourishing. Even infrastructure development is being privatized through the increasing use of PPP arrangements. In all these areas the increase in private sector involvement will mean an increase in the need for legal services.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the investment climate in Nigeria for the foreign companies in terms of legal and fiscal barriers?</h4><p>I wouldn't say that there are any significant legal or fiscal barriers. Tax rates are not too high when compared to other jurisdictions. Also, the laws of the land are quite generous to foreign investors. However, when you come to implementation of those laws I believe there to be certain administrative and bureaucratic challenges. The one area where you might speak of a barrier would be the oil industry where local content legislation has been introduced with a view to domesticating more of the expenditure on services in that industry. Nevertheless, with a population in excess of 160 million (the largest in Africa) and a GDP in excess of $510 billion (again the largest in Africa) the country will remain an attractive investment destination for some time to come.</p><h4>What is Ç¼LEX's growth strategy for the coming five years?</h4><p>Given the growth areas that I have identified, we plan to continue expanding our capacity to serve clients in those areas.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What factors set El-Alan apart from its competitors?<br></h4><p>We have a passion for what we do and exceed the brief on the strength of our multidisciplinary abilities. When given a design, we re-engineer it from the ground up and return to the client to propose improvements both in terms of design and functionality. We are also highly selective in terms of our projects. We want to differentiate ourselves by working in the highest quality markets. Therefore, when clients approach us they should not focus on price, as one doesn't when considering a performance car. Strategically, this is where we are trying to slot ourselves in the market. We are also agents for high-end brand items. We are effectively a one-stop shop, in that we design, build, and manage properties, which is what differentiates us. This enables our construction business to then supply better products. I am well aware of the challenges that can arise in terms of maintenance, and we are often invited as facilities managers at the design stage to provide input on how designs can be amended for better maintenance and to provide a longer lifespan for the client's asset. Maintenance is the key, and the guts of the building.</p><h4>Why is the demand for prime-grade locations growing, and what does it mean for your development pipeline?</h4><p>Demand for quality has evolved. Previously Nigerians were less qualityconscious, but today a new taste has grown for the best, especially as choice has now widened. The first acquisition of a well-to-do Nigerian used to be a flat in London. That has changed, and today many Nigerians are returning home to invest in a good property. As a result, we are particularly busy, expanding and recruiting. We have been growing at a rate of nearly 30% a year over the past five or six years. We are engaged in around 10 projects currently, having handed on certain projects from a total of 23. We also undertake considerable industrial work, where we stand to become the leading contractor. Aside from the superlative standards we adhere to, we are also approached by diverse industries that look to our varied experience, whereby we become their in-house contractors in Nigeria.</p><h4>Have you also entered into partnerships with foreign companies?</h4><p>Yes, and these are the kinds of agencies we are talking about. We are looking for additional investment, in particular in terms of development. I think the time is right for real estate and real estate agencies. For us it would be key because in terms of complementing our core activities. We need to become an international name to be able to leverage our skills across the construction value chain.</p><h4>What is your assessment of construction sector viability for foreign investment?</h4><p>I think Nigeria ranks among the best investment destinations in the world. It has reached a threshold that makes it the next India, China, or Brazil in terms of the size of its middle class, earnings, and development. There is a current housing shortage, and between now and 2020 Nigeria will need 20 million homes. There are challenges of course. The first involves technical skills, which we are trying to address through our schools, which are inadequate with classes of around 50 students. Funds are available, and need to be tapped as people are eager to learn.</p><h4>Does government regulation of the sector present a challenge?</h4><p>The lack of regulation and overregulation are both challenges at the same time. It is challenging because the law curbs the number of foreigners a company can employ, as well as there being significant bureaucracy to contend with, and it seems that the government needs to be better in touch with the needs of the business community. My concern is not necessarily to employ a foreign employee with a degree, but rather, a technically competent person such as a mason or bricklayer, capable, moreover, of transferring their skills to local technicians. Meanwhile, the lack of adequate regulations does not affect our business as we always operate by the book, although many companies build sub-standard and even dangerous buildings with impunity. As a result, clients are determined to select contractors with a solid reputation. The poor quality work I have mentioned is not a failing on the part of reputable contractors, but of the system itself.</p><h4>How do you deal with the high costs of doing business in Nigeria?</h4><p>The cost is high because materials are expensive, while that of labor is misleadingly low because although the local labor market is cheap you need to build a significant workforce to guarantee the quality required. That becomes particularly expensive, as the average cost of employing an expatriate ranges from $100,000 to $500,000 a year.</p><h4>What broad trends have you identified in your sector for the coming years?</h4><p>Many multinationals will be looking to Nigeria, as it now registers strongly on the global radar. Today, when thinking of investment in Africa, Nigeria springs to mind first as the largest market. It has developed a prominent manufacturing base. The potential is huge, as a result of which construction follows. What makes Nigeria such a strong address for investment is its well-educated population of 170 million, more than 50% of which is aged less than 18.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Julius Berger arrived in Nigeria about 50 years ago. What is left of your German heritage and how localized is the company now?<br></h4><p>Today Julius Berger is an indigenous Nigerian company. We are headquartered in Abuja with additional permanent locations in Lagos and Uyo, and we are listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange. Over 96% of our workforce is Nigerian, and we are dedicated to our investments in Nigerian content. Throughout our 50 years of operating in Nigeria, we have played an important role in the country's development, starting with our first construction project in the country, which was the Eko Bridge in 1965. Currently, Bilfinger Berger, a German construction company, owns approximately one-third of the shares; the other two-thirds are under Nigerian ownership, including individuals, pension funds, states, and large and small investors.</p><h4>What are some of the company's main strengths that it seeks to leverage?</h4><p>Julius Berger's commitment to Nigeria is one of the greatest strengths. We have huge investments in this country, not least of which are the roughly 20,000 people on our payroll. These investments are not solely monetary, but in facilities we need to run our business. Nigeria is headed in the right direction, even if not the most stable country in the world. Businesses here require a plan for the worst-case scenario, and the potential return on investments must clearly be weighed up against the risks. Operating exclusively in Nigeria, we do not have the opportunity of packing up our operations and returning to a home country if the worst occurs. This reality confirms our commitment, as this will remain our country come what may. Through Bilfinger Berger we have a pipeline to the Western world. This gives us access to cutting-edge technology and the international market in terms of procurement and recruitment. We would not be able to ensure quality and reliability with Nigerian resources alone. That said, while our business dealings and the projects we deliver are part of a global issue, the company's decisions are made locally. We are not remote-controlled from abroad, which we view as a major success.</p><h4>You have taken on the challenge of constructing the new Second Niger Bridge. Could you elaborate on this project?</h4><p>If you look at the Nigerian economy and lack of infrastructure, the construction of the Second Niger Bridge is key—economically, politically, and socially. We have been following the developments surrounding this bridge for a while now. Around 10 or 15 years ago there were many related developments, although nothing came to fruition. Just under two years ago, we became convinced that on this occasion the government was serious, and we actively started to participate. There are challenges, but we are confident of being able to overcome them. The primary challenge, I believe, lies in the fact that the bridge is to be built under the public-private partnership (PPP) model. If you look at the legal environment and the policy landscape, PPP is a quite new formula that we have never dealt with. Due to the nature of this project, we have aggressively looked at the possibilities of and partners for this undertaking. We were very proud that our consortium was declared the preferred bidder. If a non-indigenous company had emerged as the preferred bidder, it would have been bitterly disappointing.</p><h4>How is your company contributing to the realization of Nigeria's goals for Vision 2020?</h4><p>The major area to be developed in achieving the goals of Vision 2020 is the downstream and manufacturing sectors. Vision 2020 will be very difficult to achieve if the focus lies exclusively on oil-producing plants and roads. Employment in manufacturing plants is necessary. These factories will generate revenue and add weight to national GDP. Nigeria, I believe, is more of a trading society. This is good to a certain extent, but the real economy is the downstream industry—manufacturing, agriculture, and so forth. We are repositioning our company to be prepared to deliver our services to investors in this industry.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us an insight into the operations of Flour Mills of Nigeria (FMN) and the role of the Agro Allied Division?<br></h4><p>FMN started in 1960 as a single flourmill and has expanded to other byproducts of wheat such as pasta, semolina, and noodles, as well as into other fields, such as cement, fertilizer, and animal feed. In order to bag all these products, we established BAGCO, which produces more than one million bags a day. The Flour Mills Group comprises two main pillars of operation: the Food Group, which commercializes, sells, packages, retails, and markets the Group's food products, and the Agro Allied Division, which cultivates crops to provide raw materials for its processing activities. The Division was created five year ago when we identified a need to replace imported raw materials for processing food products with locally grown and processed products. We started off with farms in the North, which were growing maize and soya beans, and have subsequently added another 26 companies and operations to this division, which now supplies raw materials for most of the food products that we produce in Nigeria.</p><h4>FMN is investing in backward integration along the value chain. What is the rationale behind this, and how do you assess success in this regard?</h4><p>Backward integration is a new concept in West Africa and arose where countries had become so dependent on imported foodstuffs that it made sense to continue the process with the ultimate aim of effecting a transition to locally produced goods over a period of time. Each of our value chains in Agro Allied has a backward integration program, except for wheat, which is not grown on a commercial level in Nigeria due to unfavorable climatic conditions. However, even in wheat there is an element of backward integration because we produce cassava flour and that is blended with wheat flour to reduce overall wheat imports. With rice, we import, mill, bag, and distribute it throughout Nigeria and support the business with two rice farms that grow, de-husk, and mill the rice on-site. We also have palm plantations where we produce crude palm oil and palm kernels, and that is part of the supply that goes into our edible oil business.</p><h4>What key challenges do you face in this sector?</h4><p>One of our challenges has been to improve our crop yields. It has been difficult to source certain varieties locally, particularly for sugar, rice, maize, and soya beans. Recently we have succeeded in identifying and importing seed varieties that give us an acceptable commercial yield. There have also been infrastructural challenges with the crops that require irrigation, such as rice and sugar, which have required irrigation schemes. Proximity to water for irrigation renders operations vulnerable to flooding, and we have experienced such problems. Much of our produce has to be transported from the farm to processing plants. During this process, we have experienced deterioration, particularly with cassava, which doesn't travel well. Transport is time consuming, faces the risk of theft along the way, and incurs the high costs of roadblocks and taxes imposed throughout a journey. One way in which we have overcome this challenge involves processing closer to our agriculture centers, and then transporting the finished product to our distribution centers.</p><h4>What is your take on the Agriculture Transformation Agenda (ATA)?</h4><p>The ATA is critical for Nigeria in terms of rekindling its agriculture sector, and diversifying away from oil and gas. The ATA and the national industrial revolution (NIR) are two programs the President is using to drive transformation of these sectors and make the nation less dependent on the oil sector. We have aligned many of our objectives to support the ATA program. The crops, raw materials, and value chains we are in are those Nigeria needs to feed its people. Through this alignment we have become the main supporter of the ATA in Nigeria. We now have over $500 million invested in agri-processing in Nigeria and much of that came about because of the ATA.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you elaborate on the services Biostadt Group offers?<br></h4><p>We have been present in Nigeria since 1964, and are involved in three areas of business, namely agrocare, pharmacare, and healthcare. At Biostadt, we consider technology and solutions. In agribusiness, we look at what is available in the world of agriculture that will help farmers improve their crops and optimize yield potential. We look at technologies in terms of how they affect crop husbandry, agronomy, and post-harvest storage. We consider it across the entire value chains of the various crops being grown in Nigeria. Our teams also come up with solutions for crop protection across the various stages of growth and for the various crops. We are training our farmers with our pool of experts and agronomists. In the healthcare sector, the core problems we face in Nigeria relate to the lack of appropriate medical technology for diagnosis. That has been responsible for the high level of medical tourism in the country. Last year, figures from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) showed that Nigerians are spending $2 billion on medical tourism a year. This is not because the doctors are not good—they are—but because they lack the technology to deliver proper diagnoses. We thought that we needed to step in; so, today, after four or five years, we have been able to improve this sector. We have been able to install several magnetic resonance imaging machines and other radio-diagnostics across the country in both public and private entities. But let me say explicitly that many Nigerians are dying needlessly because we do not have the right medical infrastructure. This is what drives what we do.</p><h4>What role can the private sector play in improving the situation on the ground?</h4><p>The private sector can play many roles in terms of fast-tracking the development of medical infrastructure, hospitals, and diagnostic centers. Today, for a population of over 170 million, we have only 2,000 hospitals and clinics across the entire country, with many not properly equipped. There are, then, numerous opportunities for private-sector investment in the healthcare industry. I have been advocating this, and encouraging the banks to finance private sector investment in this arena, because the need and the market exist.</p><h4>In agricultural terms, how can the government support SMEs without neglecting foreign investors?</h4><p>Nigerian agriculture is where it is today because of many years of neglect. We are, therefore, glad that the current government has set up a robust agricultural transformation agenda. There is room for small-, medium-, and large-scale players. And when we look at our population and at our expense on food imports, we observe more than enough room for everyone. A high percentage of agribusiness companies in the country import raw agricultural materials for processing, meaning there is much room for development. The government needs to continue developing special policy frameworks for companies of all sizes to tap into. And there is more than enough of appeal for foreign investors. We are looking for investors in industrial agriculture. We need people who can go into processing, and now is the right time to invest in Nigerian agriculture.</p><h4>How important is it for the group to invest in R&amp;D, and what are the requirements for companies that may want to partner with you here in Nigeria?</h4><p>First of all, the foreign organization has to share our values. We view business as a social enterprise. If you come here, we can make money for you, but if we cannot see value for the society and for the customer, we will be wary of partnering with you. We also consider whether potential partners have the tenacity to stay for the long haul. We are ready to invest, and need to do so, in R&amp;D, together. We are looking at biotechnical products and the possibility of local production. We are also looking at what we can do locally to add value to our current operations.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How could diverse sectors of the economy collaborate to develop the tourism offering?<br></h4><p>Tourism is a private sector activity, but in Nigeria it has been deemed the sole responsibility of the public sector. Goals can be best achieved in collaboration, and so in our first year we have reached out to almost everyone in the expatriate community. Never before has a director general visited state governments to declare federal government support. Domestic tourism is about the local customs, festivals, and cultures that are unique to Nigerians, and unless you meet the traditional rulers—the kings and custodians of our culture and traditions—you cannot fully experience the culture of the people. You find that the traditional rulers are enlightened and educated people, who, despite living in America or Europe, are sooner or later recalled home to serve as kings and queens. They are particularly informed individuals and have a keen grip on what tourism means in Nigeria. And we are not just collaborating with the diplomatic community and traditional rulers, but also with the state governance arm so that we can market on their behalf. We are also partnering with the banks and oil companies to source financing. Furthermore, we collaborate with other government agencies that support us with capacity building, such as the National Planning Commission. These governmental agencies understand what tourism involves and respond positively when approached. We are also partnering with the Nigerian Football Federation because we believe that the youth are key to our strategy. Some 70% of the Nigerian population is aged below 35, with sport featuring prominently in their lives. We have signed MoUs with private sector international companies in Nigeria that want to promote tourism with us. We have also signed a MoU to collaborate with the transport industry. This is the tourism value chain. Ultimately, tourism is not an isolated activity, but a centrifugal force that impacts other sectors. We suffer from terrorism in one or two small areas, but Nigeria has an area of over 923,000 sqkm and 174 million people, and terrorism is not peculiar to Nigeria and the government has been very proactive in managing it.</p><h4>The majority of tourists appear to be unaware of just what Nigeria has to offer. Why should people visit?</h4><p>There is such a wide range of factors that make the country a special destination starting with the fantastic year-round sunny weather, a real pull for visitors from the US and Europe. In terms of the state, we are a democratic nation run by a transparent government that came into power through a fair election. Regarding tourist sites, the country is divided into six geopolitical zones, and I have made an effort to visit states in each. If you go to the southwest, for example, you come to Ondo State among beautiful hills and amazing golf courses. In addition to our sights, Nigeria offers a whole spectrum of amazing regional festivals that underline the unique culture of the country.</p><h4>Could you talk about domestic tourism as a means of creating a national identity?</h4><p>This is my favorite topic, because domestic tourism means encouraging people to vacation in their own country. One reason is that we want to empower people at the grassroots level. Secondly, of the 170 million Nigerians, only 10% can afford to travel abroad. If you inculcate the culture of domestic tourism, people do not have to go far from home. If we develop tourism in a community and jobs come with it. There are three types of tourism: inbound, domestic, and outbound. We are hoping that the 10% that travels abroad will have experienced domestic tourism, meaning they will effectively be marketing agents for Nigeria when abroad. The domestic tourism market in Nigeria has a potential of $4 billion, but we just need to keep creating awareness and encouraging people.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As of today, Nigeria has over 70 health maintenance organizations (HMOs) spread across the country. How do you see this number evolving in the future?<br></h4><p>I see consolidation on the horizon. Within the existing regulations, the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) has pursued a re-accreditation of the HMOs to look at their minimum requirements to operate. The foremost requirement is that HMOs that are operating in all states and geo-political zones of the country (called national HMOs) should have a minimum capital of slightly above $2 million. The deadline for the HMOs to meet the requirements was August 31, 2014. This criterion is one thing that could bring about a lot of consolidation in the form of HMO mergers and acquisitions. With this consolidation happening, the number of HMOs will come down from the present 77 and the remaining players will be financially stronger. Something similar just happened here in the banking sector; it has also happened in the insurance sector. Another reason why I feel it will happen and the health insurance industry will become strengthened is that there is a new National Health Insurance Commission Act and National Health Insurance Commission coming in. It will be a financial cum healthcare regulator in practice.</p><h4>What is Hygeia HMO's customer segment? Do you see any other market in the population potentially in need of your services?</h4><p>The market has different segments. One is employees in the formal sector. It is easy to identify them. Naturally, the client is the employer because in this case they are the ones paying for it. That is one of the factors that has contributed to the growth of health insurance in Nigeria. In our case, what we normally do is differentiate employers by size in terms of the number of employees. We operate today in segments where there are at least 10 employees. For us, from 10 up to 50 employees is an SME. Up to 200 or so is “corporate" and up to 500 is “large corporate." The idea is to have structured pricing and product packaging depending on the level of the client. We have clients with more than 65,000 enrollees also. We only do SME and corporate business today. But, we must bear in mind that the majority of the population is not formally employed or they are employed in organizations with three or four employees. It is the people who are either employed in the informal sector or on their own, in SMEs, who are looking for coverage for themselves and their families, or themselves and their two or three employees. That is the next market. Reaching out to them is the biggest challenge. Customer retention in this segment is also a problem. At the end of this year we will venture into the SME sector for the high-end market. The mid and low segments will follow. We will not venture into the lowest segment of the market, as our not-for-profit venture called Hygeia Community Health Care (HCHC) is handling that segment of the market.</p><h4>Do you foresee coming up with any special plans to serve these sub-segments of the market?</h4><p>Yes. Today we have HyEssential Plus, HyPriority Plus, HyClassic Plus, and HyPrestige Plus. Our vision is to be fully up to international standards. All of our existing plans only cover domestic care. You are not up to international standards if you do not provide coverage outside of Nigeria, because there is care that is not available in Nigeria. Providing coverage outside of Nigeria is part of the strategy. We will be venturing into that direction this year. Hygeia is the strongest brand in this business in the country, and we will be building strategic partnerships with the strongest international brands. That will be the stepping-stone for us to start venturing into the SME segment and the retail segment in a big way.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>President Goodluck Jonathan launched the Agricultural Transformation Agenda in 2011, with the goal of adding 20 million metric tons of food to Nigeria's food supply, as well as creating 3.5 million jobs in the sector. How do you view the progress that you and your ministry have made regarding these goals?<br></h4><p>The progress has been positive and our goals in terms of the volume of food to be added to the national food supply were exceeded in 2014, well ahead of the target date of 2015. Meanwhile, the Agricultural Transformation Agenda (ATA) has raised the prospects of farm employment significantly. Various activities at different levels of the commodity value chains have created job opportunities. In rice alone, the federal government has created over 360,000 rural jobs across Nigeria. And, with over 10 value chains, the increase in job openings spans farm labor in primary production and processing. It is my fervent hope that more will still be produced and further jobs created before the end of 2015.<br></p><h4>How will the Staple Crops Processing Zones contribute to private sector investment in Nigeria's agriculture sector?</h4><p>Nigeria's endowment of 263 billion cubic meters of water, a bulk of which comes from two of the largest rivers in Africa, are a great agricultural benefit. But much of these have not been used for the optimal production of food. Staple Crops Processing Zones (SCPZ) can greatly improve access to, and the unlocking of, this largely untapped potential. The SCPZs are new agricultural infrastructure-enabled zones that are being developed to attract agribusiness investors into rural areas. They address the infrastructure challenges and constraints of the agro-processing industry, drive social and economic impacts, offer a superior operating environment for downstream players and also create a new platform for private sector investment in agriculture. Food manufacturing companies are being attracted to establish themselves within these zones, bringing them closer to farmers and areas of high food production. The proximity among the various stakeholders will increase the tempo of business and production volume. This will create opportunities for stakeholders and improve their business status along the value chains. Fourteen SCPZs will be developed across the country and master plans have already been completed for six of them. A leading international company is considering investment of over $100 million for the establishment of a 65,000 MT starch plant in one of these zones. Dangote group plans to invest $1 billion in rice SCPZs to boost national rice production and processing capacity. The World Bank, the African Development Bank, and other development finance institutions plan to commit up to $1 billion towards the development of these zones.</p><h4>Bank lending to the agriculture sector has risen from 0.7% to 5% of total bank lending within two years. What accounts for this, and what is its significance?</h4><p>One major reason is a rising level of confidence in agriculture over the past three years due to the investment-friendly policies of the Jonathan administration, the de-risking of bank lending through a facility known as the Nigerian Incentive-based Risk Sharing in Agricultural Lending (NIRSAL), jointly developed by the Ministry and the Central Bank of Nigeria. Realizing that a bulk of their risk burden has been increased, and seeing the money trail in agricultural transactions, the bank thought it was time to become a player in the agricultural sector by lending to input suppliers, farmers, and processors. To improve financial access for farmers, we have taken bold steps. The NIRSAL reduces the risks associated with lending to agribusinesses and farmers. Agricultural lending as a share of total bank lending rose from 0.7 to 5% within two years. Bank lending to seed companies and small agricultural input retailers rose from zero in 2011, to $10 million in 2012 and $53 million in 2013. Bank lending to fertilizer companies rose from $100 million in 2012 to $500 million in 2013. It is remarkable that the default rate has been at 0% over the past two years. The reforms we have made are improving the prospects for Nigerian farmers, but also capturing the attention of external investors. Over the past 24 months, we have attracted $4 billion in executed private sector letters of commitment to invest in our agricultural sector. We have also received significant financial backing from the World Bank, the African Development Bank, the International Fund for Agriculture Development, the UK Department for International Development, the United States Agency for International Development, the United Nations Development Program, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, and the Ford Foundation. To drive and provide much needed equity financing for small and medium-sized agribusinesses, the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, the Federal Ministry of Finance and the German Development Bank, KFW, have jointly established a $100 million equity and quasi-equity fund. Improved bank lending is a sign of growing confidence in the agricultural sector.</p><h4>A large percentage of the sector is made up of small and medium scale agribusinesses. In which ways does the Ministry endeavor to support these medium and small agribusinesses?</h4><p>In every ecology, the small, the medium, and the large creatures co-exist. Interventions applicable to each distinct category of agribusiness are currently being implemented. While we do not want to displace the smallholders, we see the urgency of promoting large-scale investors and making them produce. We are doing a rapid transformation of key agricultural value chains—from the farm to the table. To achieve these, we are working to create ecosystems in which small, medium, and large-scale farming systems not only co-exist but also flourish. We are focused on creating value added products from staple crops—through an aggressive import substitution program and other policy reforms to accelerate food production and agricultural resilience.</p><h4>What is your medium term outlook for the agriculture sector in Nigeria?</h4><p>It is important to harness the enormous human and natural resources that abound all over the country. Of the 84 million hectares of arable land in Nigeria, only 40% is presently cultivated. Nigeria's immense agricultural potential is a great asset for the nation in particular and Africa in general, with promises for food security when fully harnessed. The market potential for our agricultural produce remains under-utilized. While there is a huge market opportunity in the international arena, creating markets locally for our own farmers remains a task to be done. Nigeria's large pool of cheap labor is available to support agricultural intensification, while also offering a huge market for agricultural produce.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[one-destination-to-another]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Over the past seven years, no licenses had been issued in Mexico for new airline carriers. What has allowed TAR to end this spell?</h4><p>TAR's concept is to develop an aviation niche that at present is not reached by the legacy carriers in the country, and what we are trying to do is open new routes to the consumer, making it possible for the various regions of the country to connect without the need to go through the nation's main aviation hubs. People living on the Gulf Coast, for example, can travel with TAR from one destination to another without transiting through Mexico City. When we presented the concept to the Ministry of Communications, we received massive support from the central government, and of course, from local governments. We have chosen to fly 50-seater jets produced for low-density routes that make them viable for the creation of a route structure and an operational structure in which we can develop business and hence opportunities that have been dormant for years. We now also have the conditions as certain major companies in Mexico are substituting such aircraft with high-density alternatives. We are currently the only company with the capability to really operate in this segment.</p><h4>TAR's head office is in Queretaro. Why did you select this city?</h4><p>Queretaro is well placed geographically at the center of the country, has a strong aeronautical industry, and its airport itself has considerable international operational capabilities. Queretaro is a regional capital, and is well connected by land, and ideally located for setting up operations. We also believe that when the new high-speed train is built more companies will be established around the city.</p><div class="quote">“We plan to open a third base in the Yucatán Peninsula to connect the Mexican Mayan world to other Caribbean destinations."</div><h4>What regions have the greatest potential for expansion?</h4><p>In March of 2015 we plan to open a third base in the Yucatán Peninsula to connect the Mexican Mayan world to other Caribbean destinations. I also see us expanding around the Baja and Naucalpan regions. Mar de Cortes is the natural beach destination for the southern states of the US, and currently we do not have direct flights from Phoenix, Houston, or San Diego. Our border cities in the north are not connected, so if you are in Tijuana and want to get to Matamoros, you have to come to Mexico City and then fly back up again. What we are trying to do is connect the northern border, the southern border, and the Gulf cities, such every region has a full connection. In short, there is a huge opportunity for regional aviation in Mexico and in terms of connectivity between the US and Mexico.</p><h4>Could you tell us more about your plans for expansion in the Caribbean?</h4><p>We are trying to establish a circuit whereby we can bring people, not only from the Mexican region of Riviera Maya, but also from Cuba, Santo Domingo, and Jamaica, to the Mexican coastal region, and that is also of major potential. The Yucatán Peninsula accounts for the majority of tourist arrivals to Mexico, but its connectivity with other Caribbean countries has still to be improved.</p><h4>TAR has been operating in Mexico for a short time period but has experienced rapid growth. What is the secret behind TAR's success?</h4><p>In Mexico we have a rare situation in which supply creates demand. Demand is there, but we are missing the products and so when we open new routes, demand rapidly follows. The key concept is that we should keep developing aviation products for existing demand, and fortunately for us, we have huge potential. Right now we have reached 13 destinations that make up over 40 routes, and the idea is that we should receive three additional aircraft by March, and thereby double the number of destinations. We are talking to the various airport groups in the country and each has a different marketing scenario, and also the ambition to connect the various airports. In addition, we are receiving support from local governments and in exchange can provide a good product to the consumer, with reasonable fares. We charge approximately $100 for an average one-way trip. In the past, our passengers would pay at least double that before flying with TAR, and so we bring an important element to the community by lowering their transportation costs.</p><h4>Why did Grupo Mafra invest in TAR?</h4><p>Grupo Mafra decided to invest in aviation once we had convinced them of the great opportunities to be exploited in this industry. We made a complete analysis of cargo, scheduled, and charter aviation, and also air taxi operations. They realized that regional aviation was the element that needed to be developed. Grupo Mafra is a local group of Queretaro and really believes that what Mexico needs is to develop opportunities in the interior of the country.</p><h4>What is TAR's long-term strategy?</h4><p>The idea as I see it is for TAR to become an emblematic company ever looking for local opportunities, even in the long-term. I believe that the TAR model is not only viable in Mexico, but could also work in other parts of Central and South America, and even as we discussed, in the US, to meet demand. The concept in the future should remain and evolve to different regions, but as I see it we should have at least 40 to 50 aircraft dedicated to the domestic business before thinking about expanding into other regions. We are looking to develop strategic alliances with local investors in different regions, both here in Mexico and abroad, which would depend upon how swiftly we develop these alliances. TAR needs to depend on such growth, based on strategic local alliances that expedite out expansion. That is what we are seeking, but on the other hand, we do not want to accelerate artificial growth, but to proceed on a steady course.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[make-an-entrance]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the company organized?</h4><p>Our holding company has three businesses: one is Panorama, a building with offices and a small mall. It has a view of the golf course and two floors of retail, with restaurants that serve around 150 offices. The project began construction a year ago and it is set for completion in December next year. We also have a project in the North, close to Ecuador. It is another large project, but geared at the lower segment, and we provide only land and services; residents undertake the construction of their homes on a site that we have constructed. We give them water, communications, light, security, some green areas, and some retail space at the entrance. They only pay for the land and then they move in and build their homes. We have sold 1,000 plots, and it is going to be finished in August of next year. The third project is the water company, to sell natural bottled water. We process mountain water, oxygenate, bottle, and sell it. This is a start up that we bought two years ago and today we are targeting the premium segment of the market.</p><h4>How is the Panorama project positioned within the Lima retail and office space market?</h4><p>We bought this land around five years ago. When Peru started growing and we saw opportunities, we conducted a study of the market to find out what the people in this area required. ıt transpired that that they wanted restaurants to cater for offices. At the time I was looking for partners to realize the project, which was a $125 million scheme. We started looking for partners that can help on the retail side, as well as for the building itself, and also a financial partner, because we source capital; we do not go through banks. For the construction of the building, we talked with Graña y Montero, a construction company, which has many companies under one umbrella. We have been working well together for one year now, and it is  a 45% partner. With our partners we launched Panorama, the only building in Peru with offices and retail, and the only one offering these amenities. Panorama is one of the biggest projects in the Lima area.</p><div class="quote">“Lima is the capital and most people live and work in the city, but now there is no more land available downtown."</div><h4>Since you first bought the land and had to wait for it to appreciate and develop around it, can you briefly describe some of the changes you have seen in Lima's retail and office space market?</h4><p>When I bought the land in 2007, there were no offices in the area, only old stock, but over the past five years office space has grown substantially. Nowadays, we have many opportunities to buy or rent office space here. Essentially, we entered the office market because it was not moving; it was a market available for entry. And with regard to retail, the reason we entered this market is because there were no retail stores on that particular side of the road. We saw the opportunity created by the construction around us, and entered the retail segment in pursuit of it.</p><h4>The retail project in Piura that you mentioned is interesting in that you are providing services typically provided by the public sector.</h4><p>As you know, Lima is the capital and most people live and work in the city, but now there is no more land available downtown. Therefore, we had to look for opportunities beyond of the city. We purchased land in Piura. Doing business there is rather different, being an informal environment where people do not have the income that found in the capital, which means you need to sell a different type of product. When you sell a residence in Lima, you sell a good quality building that can be purchased with credit, but in Piura the people cannot afford credit and work in the informal economy. And so we had to create a business model whereby we construct plots with all the services provided and sell the property in, for example, 50 installments, whereby when payment is complete the homeowners move in. They can construct their homes, and for Peru, at a price much lower than available elsewhere.</p><h4>What are your aspirations regarding future projects?</h4><p>When you realize these projects numerous retail and office opportunities arise. We now have on the table many projects beyond Lima, but nothing definite or concrete as we are waiting to see how the market develops over the coming months. but we are considered a group that identifies opportunities. And so, tomorrow, if I see an opportunity to enter another sector I will find a way to grasp it.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance of cyber security across industries and what are the opportunities for the cyber defense industry of Turkey?</h4><p>Cyber security has to be considered from two perspectives, first on our own information system's requirements. Secondly, and more importantly, it must be considered in terms of the requirements of the Turkish Armed Forces. For its own requirements, the Information Systems Department has been regenerated from scratch and staff has received a great deal of training on handling threats. Also, the Ministry has updated the internal regulations applied to the information systems and Ministry staff. We have also initiated an exercise applied to numerous governmental agencies to assess our current preparedness regarding the threat cyber attacks. In that exercise, several cyber attacks of different types have been carried out to test the performance of the security systems currently used. We have evaluated the results and taken the necessary actions. We are aware that this process is an issue that has to be progressed and developed continuously. From the perspective of the Turkish Armed Forces, we have initiated several projects as well as feasibility studies, and also held numerous conferences and workshops. For instance, this issue was taken seriously at the highest levels in 2008 by the Middle East Technical University (METU) in Ankara, which undertook a Network-Enabled Capability (NEC) Feasibility study. For this study, about 25 academics from METU and 10 engineers from a private company worked together with the Turkish Armed Forces to devise a roadmap for NEC for Turkey. Now, Turkey's Undersecretariat for Defense Industries (SSM) follows that roadmap and has undertaken three additional projects with its own resources to increase awareness within military agencies. We have also held several workshops and conferences, which brought the related sides of this issue together. Such collaborations and mutual workshops provide substantial opportunities for the cyber security environment. The Turkish Armed Forces has a separate command for cyber warfare and we are closely working with it. As a result, I can say that we are aware that cyber warfare issues have to be handled carefully through a plan and in advance.</p><h4>What is the Ministry's strategy to boost exports from the defense industry?</h4><p>We are working hard to be one of the major global suppliers with a strategy based on high value added, high-tech products and services, which define our roadmap for the coming decade. We are willing to be one of the important members of the defense league with our strategic approach, political will and determination, national coordination, and cooperation among relevant institutions and bodies, quickly developing know-how, a highly talented R&amp;D labor force, growing companies, high-quality products, increasing PR and sales efforts, as well as our political, economic, and historical links with many regions and countries around the world. In the scope of the 2012-2016 Strategy Document objectives of the SSM, we will focus on the endeavors to ensure the health of the defense sector. Moreover, the SSM will guide the SMEs and suppliers represented in the defense industry in order to develop their capabilities related to the program management and levels of technology. As has been acknowledged for many years, the offset has been implemented and executed under the defense industry projects. For the defense industry projects, contractors are obliged to commit an Industrial Participation/Offset (IP/O) obligation amounting to at least 70% of the main contract value, within the framework of the IP/O Directive published in 2011. To emphasize the SMEs' importance, the contractors are held to the 2011 IP/O directive Category-A (Industrial Participation) requirements of at least 30% of the Industry/SME share and as a share of at least 15% of SMEs. For the proposals to be submitted in this respect, greater use of the local industry, especially SMEs and suppliers, is primarily promoted to develop the domestic defense industry. After this point, the real challenge we are facing in terms of SMEs is the limited volume of the domestic defense and aerospace market. Therefore, international cooperation activities are becoming more important. We think that Turkish companies are the most successful in the Middle East, the Gulf region, and also Southeast Asia. On the other hand, we are continuously focused on South America, and to a certain extent North America, but that is a very hard market to penetrate. Furthermore, we are trying to improve our impression in some European countries. For example, for our indigenous fighter jet program, we are looking for a working partner from Europe, not because we are afraid to develop the project ourselves, but more because it will allow us in the future to export it more easily. We have the same approach in some other programs. We have partnerships with Germany in the battle tank program for example, and also with Korea because we think that this can provide wider marketing arena. The Turkish Armed Forces' reputation is excellent and recognized worldwide for its expertise. This, of course, gives a significant edge on the international market, especially regarding indigenous developments. Indeed, international buyers are usually wary of indigenous development, but if the Turkish Armed Forces are buying it, it lends an air of confidence and a guarantee of product quality as our armed forces have hundreds of years of experience. Furthermore, they know that the Turkish Armed Forces will not accept any system that is less than 100% perfect. We could cite many examples of this, such as the verification process of the T129 helicopter being extended because of a discussion about scratches on glass, or where the pilots put their feet when not depressing the pedals. This attention to detail is an excellent assurance to would-be buyers, as a weapons system being accepted and used by the Turkish Armed Forces is an internationally recognized stamp of quality. Moreover, most of the countries we partner with on our products also look for the training expertise of the Turkish Armed Forces. If you buy an attack helicopter, then you are under the umbrella of Turkish Armed Forces aviators, who will train and assist you with logistics organization.</p><h4>What is your assessment of Turkey's ability to create an armored fighting vehicle (AFV)?</h4><p>Turkey started production activities for the M113 armored fighting vehicle (AFV) under license in 1988 with FNSS Defense Systems in Ankara. More than 2000 AFVs in different configurations have been produced and delivered to the Turkish Armed Forces through contracts between the SSM and FNSS. These vehicles are still operational today. Since then, FNSS has improved its capabilities in design and was able to develop its own wheeled and tracked Armored Combat Vehicles. Pars 6x6 and Pars 8x8 are two well-known wheeled armored fighting vehicles developed by FNSS. In addition to those AFVs, FNSS also developed special-purpose vehicles such as the Armored Amphibious Assault Bridge and Amphibious Armored Combat Earthmover under contracts signed with SSM. Another domestic capability has been developed with OTOKAR through production of Land Rover Defender tactical vehicles under license. Just like FNSS, OTOKAR has also improved its capabilities during this time, and has been able to design and develop its own wheeled and tracked Armored Combat Vehicles, such as the Cobra 4x4, Cobra-II 4x4, Arma 6x6, Arma 8x8, Tulpar tracked AFV, and the ALTAY Main Battle Tank. ALTAY is one of the most sophisticated high-tech armored vehicles on the market, which demonstrates that we are one of the nine or 10 Main Battle Tank developers in the world. Another example of the armored vehicle development capability exists at BMC, which developed Kirpi Mine Resistant Ambush Protect (MRAP) vehicles, where more than 500 vehicles have already been delivered to the Turkish Armed Forces. Those vehicles have been combat proven in many mine and IED attacks to date. In summary, over the past decade, we have reached the capability to design, develop, and produce any kind of armored vehicle to meet the requirements of the Turkish Armed Forces, Turkish Police, and other armies around the world.</p><h4>What is your vision of defense affairs in Turkey?</h4><p>The Turkish Defense Industry policy has been restructured and experienced a strategic transformation over the past 10 years. We are now able to design and manufacture our own critical technology defense systems. When we compare this state of affairs with the constraints on manufacturing and assembling in the past, this can be seen as a historic change. More than 10 years ago, 80% of our defense industry was dependent on foreign technology, but today, by mobilizing Turkey's engineering and production capabilities, it has been transformed into a structured national industry with more than 1,000 companies, SMEs, and the participation of research organizations and universities. Today, our defense industry has reached an annual production capacity of almost $5 billion with an export capacity of $1.4 billion. It receives Turkey's largest investment in R&amp;D with $773 million in annual R&amp;D expenditures. By removing the barriers and obstacles blocking our defense industry, with the necessary encouragement given, the needs and requirements of our Armed Forces are being addressed by local industry. In this process, nearly 100 military ships and patrol vessels have been produced and delivered by Turkish shipyards. Today, our navy is on the way to becoming entirely locally supplied. Furthermore, our new breakthroughs in the fields of frigates and submarines will continue unabated. Our aviation sector, which has been at a standstill for years, came back to life when our first National aircraft, the HÜRKUÅž, designed in accordance with the European Aviation Safety Authority certification standards, took off in 2013. Moreover, the developments of our indigenous helicopter project, which will meet military and civilian helicopter requirements, have been started and our national fighter aircraft conceptual design has been completed. After conducting a wide range of studies on UAVs, we decided to create a large UAV family with joint production to fulfill our own needs and to target the needs of foreign markets. The maritime patrol aircraft developed by our own capable national industry has also been added to our inventory and AWACS aircraft are scheduled to start operations over the next few months. The armored vehicle requirements of the Land Forces will continue to be developed under indigenous production, and as a result of large investments in new generation rocket and missile technologies, cruise missiles, anti-tank missiles, and guided missiles are now being manufactured indigenously with our own technologies. Furthermore, studies and research has been initiated for the establishment of our own satellite-launch center. Our first national observation satellite, Göktürk-1, is scheduled to be launched in 2015. It will have a higher image resolution than the Göktürk-2, our first satellite, which has been successfully launched and tested. Our military observation and communications satellite systems will, therefore, be completely designed and manufactured in Turkey. Moreover, to eliminate the legacy of past neglect regarding air defense, huge steps have also been taken. The first launch trial of the HİSAR missile, developed for low- and medium-altitude air defense, was successfully completed in October. And in the international tender opened for the long-range air defense system based on co-production and technology transfer, the most cost-efficient solution was selected for our country. For the first time in our history, we are also planning to introduce our first national infantry rifle, which is being manufactured with the latest technology. This means that the weapons used by our troops will not be under foreign production or license. In 2023, when we celebrate the centenary of our Republic, we plan to: have our first national fighter aircraft; to launch locally designed satellites; to produce national submarines; and to put into service air defense systems. In this direction, we have taken the necessary decisions and initial steps. In the environment we live in, we have a wide range of security challenges that require defense technologies, and we should have, as our main objective, the meeting of our requirements through national resources. The Turkish Armed Forces will enjoy the wholehearted support of our country's industry, engineers, design capability, and production power, and our national defense will be based on our national strength.</p><div class="quote">“We are working hard to be one of the major global suppliers."</div><p>© The Business Year - January 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of your upcoming projects and goals for 2015?</h4><p>2015 is a landmark year for MBS as we mark our 50th anniversary. The University of Manchester has received a landmark donation for the future development of Manchester Business School from Lord Alliance of Manchester and his fellow Trustees of the Alliance Family Foundation. In recognition of this support and Lord Alliance's long-standing relationship with the University and the Business School, the School will be named Alliance Manchester Business School, or Alliance MBS. The naming comes at a pivotal moment for the School as it continues to attract more world leading researchers and teachers, prepares to celebrate its 50th anniversary, and breaks ground on a new building. In the Middle East, our main goals are to continue to recruit and support top quality students for our part-time MBA program, broadening our geographical coverage and creating greater access and deepening diversity with more female students. We also expect to see a rise in company-supported MBA students. We will also be nurturing the regional alumni association to provide ongoing support to the growing MBS community. We will extend our program portfolio with the launch of our Executive Education open program in Dubai, in the autumn—the first MBS program of its kind to be launched beyond the UK. This program is aimed at experienced managers who have been identified in succession plans to move into key positions, and who require practical preparation for these roles. Talent management is a constant theme in the region and we will continue to build our Talent Management Partnerships (TMPs) with multinational and regional companies looking to develop their management teams. More partnerships and growth in the corporate engagement areas are being developed. In terms of building our research activity, we are currently working on two activities: the first is a research paper with The Economist on the impact of Expo 2020 and on the talent gap related to megaprojects in the region. The second research project addresses creativity and innovation in the Middle East, and is undertaken by our own MBS researchers. MBS has a range of important collaborations and partnerships in place in the Middle East and we aim to reinforce and extend these during 2015. We will be working closely as we prepare to host the first visit to Dubai of the global cohort of students on our new Global Executive MBA program for upper level management.</p><h4>How would you describe the knowledge or talent gaps that exist when it comes to Dubai's human capital?</h4><p>With the rapid pace of Dubai's economic growth, the talent gap is inevitably a moving target and success presents its own challenges in attracting and retaining the right talent. The number and scale of initiatives to have been launched over the past few months in the UAE generally, as well as in Dubai, also affect the economy. For example, Expo 2020 demands a certain set of skills that are quite different from those related to the creation of a hub for the Islamic economy. Dubai and the UAE have put the development of a knowledge-based economy at the top of the agenda. Based on our own experience, we believe collaborations are key, and we need higher education institutes, working together with the public and private sectors, to collaborate in identifying and filling those skill gaps, to ensure that we remain in step with the market and responsive to its needs. We have identified some of those gaps, but while higher education providers can help meet needs we also need vocational training and short-term training providers to focus on skills requirements. Filling the talent gap requires a reskilling of the current workforce, not just the importing of talent. We need to look at building education and training capacity from within and our continued economic growth may be at risk if we do not continue to invest, build, and up-skill our own local human capital. When it comes to implementation, this is when we need to work in collaboration more with the private sector because it has greater agility and the commercial flexibility to execute these skills development projects. There will be commercial benefits to the private sector too by being early adopters and supporters of human capital building for the major projects and initiatives planned in Dubai and Abu Dhabi.</p><h4>What are some of the academic disciplines you see as being most desirable as Dubai continues to grow?</h4><p>Project management, corporate governance, and global business ethics will be in very high demand through 2015 and beyond. With Dubai's increasing global exposure, and the pace of development here, there will be greater scrutiny of plans and how they are executed. We need to ensure that our environmental sustainability, corporate social responsibility, and values are clear and sustainable. Transparency is essential and areas such as corporate governance are shooting up the management agenda.</p><h4>Considering that the National Vision 2021 for Innovation focuses on knowledge integration and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, how do you see the education sector evolving over the next few years?</h4><p>Education and education institutions will play a key role, especially when it comes to innovation and research. The University of Manchester is just one of the 30-plus universities to have a presence here. The University of Manchester has the Manchester Institute of Innovation Research, and we have one of the largest business incubators in Europe; The Manchester Business School Incubator offers a unique opportunity to budding entrepreneurs and start up businesses. This kind of success needs to be translated locally and we must transfer that knowledge and know-how, building local capacity and local talent. I believe in the power of collaboration and collaboration between the different higher education institutes will be essential to try and translate some of this big innovation vision into smaller practical steps that are achievable.</p><h4>What has Manchester Business School done to foster innovation locally?</h4><p>We believe in fostering innovation through collaboration; three examples are the Manchester Innovation Award for Emiratis, the first research into the GCC market for executive education, and the Ro'Ya program to support women entrepreneurs. We introduced the Manchester Innovation Award for Emiratis to help stimulate entrepreneurship among young Emirati nationals in terms of innovation, commercial and environmental sustainability, and the creation of jobs. We provided the academic framework and support, and through our partners we rallied support from the Dubai and Abu Dhabi governments to provide the financial and practical means to get the winning projects up and running, from processing used cooking oil into energy to creating an organic cafe brand. Our study on the GCC Market for Executive Education was undertaken in collaboration with TECOM and Dubai International Academic City, and identified skills gaps and evaluated the market potential for executive education providers, revealing these insights for the first time. The study covered over 500 human resources professionals and senior managers from companies in a range of sectors across the six GCC countries. The research highlighted the short-term executive education priorities including leadership, business planning, and strategy, which were identified as core training areas by more than one-third of respondents. Longer-term priorities included organizational development, leadership, and strategy. All the research findings were shared with the HR and training community in Dubai. Ro'Ya is a joint collaboration between the Dubai Business Women Council and MasterCard, supported by Manchester Business School, with the aim of providing coaching and mentorship to aspiring female entrepreneurs in the UAE looking to establish new businesses. The first Ro'Ya program was highly successful, attracting a large and passionate group of aspiring businesswomen, all keen to bring their innovative business ideas to life.</p><div class="quote">“Education and education institutions will play a key role, especially when it comes to innovation and research."</div><p>© The Business Year - January 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>After more than 18 years in the market, what factors have led to Audifarma's leadership in the pharmaceutical sector?</h4><p>We pursue a clear strategy of differentiating ourselves from the competition through added value. We are not a simple distributor, and have always had a clear vision of what we wanted to achieve and what market segment we were targeting. One of our key priorities has been to support clients by following their business activities and providing consultancy services to foster lasting relationships. We do not sell medicines directly to users; however, we fully support health suppliers in the responsible administration and supply of medicines and quality health devices at a reasonable price. We have been able to adapt ourselves to changes in the health system and meet its demands. In a way, we had a conservative vision of our clients and of where we wanted to be that has been part of our success. We started with a strong dependency on the client and gradually learned to diversify our client portfolio. In fact, our selective and conservative stance toward growth has enabled us to remain financially solid. The fact that the financial sector recognizes us is one of our main assets.</p><h4>How does the government's new Price Regulation Plan impact company activities?</h4><p>In 2006, the recovery of medication outside of benefit plans cost around $1.6 million. With the implementation of regulation T770, we opened the door to the prescription of these medicaments; therefore, it rose from $838,000 to $1.6 million in 2010. Our business strategy also included partnerships with universities to better understand the reality of the sector in which we operate. Moreover, we aim to render our knowledge more available and public through the universities. Around 10 years ago we set up a research group to identify trends in the consumption of medication in the country. To date, we have published over 50 articles both nationally and internationally. One of the studies from this group, back in 2010, was aimed at raising government awareness of the possibility of regulating prices, and the article was one of the bases of the first regulation implemented by the government. We are convinced that the regulation of prices is a legitimate and useful tool for the government to better regulate the currently abundant supply in the market, and the prevailing medicament-price ratio. In this context, we have posted double-digit growth on average each year, and only in 2014 have we seen a single-digit print. The main reason for this is the new price regulation. Despite making the entire market scenario more complex, price regulation is necessary for the future development of the sector.</p><div class="quote">“We pursue a clear strategy of differentiating ourselves from the competition through added value."</div><h4>What are some of the highlights of the ongoing studies Audifarma carries out?</h4><p>One of the most important studies has to do with the usage pattern of medicine—the use of more prescribed doses and medicaments, how these are combined, and to what extent international standards are followed. The results should show a difference between Colombian and international patterns. We have also carried out studies on the effectiveness of different medicines. We have ongoing studies into pain management to raise awareness among various industry players. At the moment we are working with seven hospitals to implement this study. Another ongoing study concerns active medicament monitoring, such as reports on reactions and other elements. One successful study we recently published covers the misuse of medicines after operations and surgical interventions. We have identified that there is insufficient control of pain for between 40% and 70% of Colombian patients post-surgery. This is a problem associated with prescriptions and the administration of lower doses, or inappropriate medicine.</p><h4>In which different segments does Audifarma operate?</h4><p>We entered the hospital segment four or five years after our incorporation. We basically manage the pharmaceutical services of clinics and hospitals, finance the purchase of medicine, and oversee inventories. Over the years, we have also come to offer other types of more complex and technical services, too. We have created synergies between all the business lines of our company, including the public service, retail supply, and hospitals. Colombia has a mature market for pharmacies. The profit margin of each of these segments varies considerably, and our objective is to create further synergies among them all.</p><h4>What are the main lines of your future strategy?</h4><p>We would like to expand activities abroad, and have already carried out research in neighboring markets, with a strong focus on the Andean region, in Peru, Chile, and Ecuador. We feel ready to take this step based on the level of experience and knowledge we have acquired in Colombia over the past 18 years.</p><h4>What actions has the company implemented to bring pharmaceutical services and products to remote areas of the country?</h4><p>We cover the main urban cities as well as certain rural areas of Colombia. In this context, we have small pharmacies in these remotes villages and areas of the country. Our goal is to ensure that our clients see that we provide the same level of quality in our services both in urban and rural areas.</p><h4>How would you assess the importance of public-private partnerships (PPPs) for the sector?</h4><p>PPPs are extremely important and useful for the sector. We believe their success is based on good communications between the parties involved. We have already developed several successful PPPs and our goal is to deepen our take in this business model, despite the difficulties of the system and the work ahead. We all need to work toward thinking that the target in the health system must be to put to an end to contractual relationships between parties, as only then will we usher in the beginning of a new era in which we will enjoy better relations among them.</p><h4>What's your outlook for the development of the sector and the role of Audifarma over the coming five years?</h4><p>I am optimistic, and we feel that we are generating added value in what we do. We believe that we will maintain, and hopefully increase, our current market share of 17%. We have great growth potential in the subsidized regime segment. The economic situation will continue to improve and regulations adopted by the government will only contribute to making the sector stronger and guarantee its future development. All in all, we are working toward a more integrated network in the sector and the system.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>2015 is the final year for the Salamatty Kazakhstan program. What are the key features?</h4><p>First of all, I would like to underline that the main goals of the Program to improve the healthcare system have been reached. The measures we have taken have helped us to stabilize the situation in healthcare, decrease the level of illness and death rates, and improve main demographic indicators. The average life expectancy has gone over the 70-year milestone, and in the past five years birth rates in the country have improved significantly; 338,180 newborns within the first 10 months of 2014 compared with 305,357 in the same period of 2009. As a result of this program, the average life expectancy for many Kazakhstani people increased to 70, and we managed to decrease mortality rates among newborns and mothers. It all became possible because of the new model of managing and financing the department. If before the financing strictly depended on the number of hospital beds and medical staff, now it is based on payments per patient. The same rates for medical services are established throughout the entire country, and financing is attached to patients with particular diseases, and is directly proportional to the gravity and complexity of the illness. We have implemented the national screening program, which allows us to reveal 11 illnesses that influence mortality at the early stages, and also broadened the accessibility of professional medical care at in-patient facilities regardless of their physical address in the country. New medical technologies are being developed, and last year we held over 60,000 cardiac surgeries, over 500 surgeries for organ and tissue transplants, and implemented new technologies to operate on the human brain. The healthcare infrastructure is developing, and over 3,300 outpatient facilities are now fully providing the population with medical care. Mobility in the medical sector is developing faster, enabling us to provide medical care even in the most remote parts of the country. We have done a lot, and we are not stopping here. Please elaborate on the key elements that can characterize your strategy of development of the healthcare sector in Kazakhstan. At the moment we are assessing the results of the current Salamatty Kazakhstan program. This assessment was carried out by leading experts from the WHO and the World Bank. It is necessary to underline that despite our continuous success in the reduction of mortality and disease rates, life expectancy rates in Kazakhstan are still much lower than in other OECD countries. The effectiveness of early detection and treatment of illnesses remains quite low, among all age groups. In addition, we are experiencing problems with staffing in the medical sector. In these circumstances the strategic goal for Kazakhstan—to be included in the 30 most-developed countries in the world and advance government policy for social protection, including the rights for healthcare and proportional amount of free medical assistance—requires further advancements in the healthcare system. When we talk about perspectives in the healthcare sector, we need to remember the constant scientific and technical progress in medical studies and the global trend of the ageing population. According to UN data, the amount of people aged 60 and above will double by 2050 and will comprise 22% of total world population. With the increase in life expectancy, chronic non-infectious diseases will lead to a steady increase in medicinal consumption in the future, and financial pressure on the medical sector. This is a global trend that we can feel in our country as well.</p><h4>The government is intending to provide easier access to medical care. How does the e-Healthcare system help to achieve this goal?</h4><p>Access to information about medical services among citizens, as well as an increase in accessibility to medical services, are some of the main priorities of the new national healthcare system, or e-Healthcare. At the moment, 14 web applications are implemented all around the country, in the form of web portals. Such portals as the electronic hospitalization bureau and the register of assigned population allow anyone even today to choose their preferred medical facility for medical check-up and treatment. It is necessary to underline that patients' access to medical facilities, be it regional clinics or national medical centers, is provided as part of free medical care. In the future, we are planning to broaden our use of information technologies in medical care. The central link of the electronic healthcare system will be the electronic health record (EHR). The EHR will contain key medical information on each patient, collected from various medical resources and information systems. It will be accessible for the patient and medical doctors providing the service. EHR will allow medical workers to monitor patient health and consider all previous medical history to make decisions. On the other hand, the patient will be able to receive notifications on upcoming medical check-ups, procedures, and doctor's appointments. We are expecting that EHR implementation will allow us to provide continuity in medical care because of the collaboration of medical workers who work for different organizations but attend to the same patient. At the same time, this will reduce the duplications and unreasonable prescription of medical services provided at early stages by different medical establishments, and will also help to optimize patients for medical care.</p><div class="quote">“The human factor is incredibly important in our field of work."</div><h4>How important is the human factor for the Ministry when it comes to the planning of quality medical services?</h4><p>The human factor is incredibly important in our field of work, because patient health and life depends on our staff's professionalism and dedication. In 2013, a group from the ministry analyzed establishments' need in qualified staff, and it showed that in primary healthcare facilities, such as clinics, female wards, and ER, there is shortage of around 2,700 specialists. In order to overcome the deficit in human resources, we are taking measures for the professional development of our specialists in order to broaden their competencies through qualification improvements in niche specialisms. I would like to share some figures to illustrate it: by the end of the current year, over 5,000 specialists from all regions will have gone through education and training in the most frequent ambulatory clinical diseases. At the same time we are increasing the role of nursing services by delegating some doctor responsibilities to nurses. When it comes to the preparation of new qualified professionals, there are measures being taken to improve professional education at the undergraduate level. Last year, the passing score to enter medical universities was increased to 65. It is worth noting that, for the moment, six medical universities around the country already have functional clinical educational centers, equipped with modern technology, including simulation equipment for practice, training facilities, and more. The international practice of human resource management calls for the planning and preparation of your acting personnel. This means a thorough analysis of current and future market requirements with consideration of local demographics, epidemiological indicators, and demand for medical assistance. The social status and prestige of the medical profession are also taken into consideration, and are often determined by the salary rates and social benefits. For this purpose, the government of Kazakhstan is improving the legal base, developing professional standards, and renewing the nomenclature and professional demands for its medical workers. We anticipate all these measures will improve and strengthen human resources in the medical sector.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>IHCC has experience building healthcare cities in Dubai. How will you take that experience and adapt it to the local Saudi market?</h4><p>Right now we are doing projects in Dubai, Egypt, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia. We realized that the boom was going on outside Saudi Arabia, but now it has returned in Saudi. We have learned a lot from Dubai and the guidelines used there, as well as international standards. Our plan for 2015 is to get back into the Saudi market and apply what we have learned in healthcare and education. We plan to open a new office and hire new people to implement this strategy in 2015. We have worked in a range of markets from cosmopolitan cities such as Dubai with international standards, to places such as Yemen, where the standards are not that high, and cities in Egypt, which is a dynamic environment with a huge population that is growing along with their standards. In Saudi Arabia, we can draw on all these mixed experiences to make us more dynamic. Saudi Arabia has a lot of opportunities and potential.</p><h4>What approach does IHCC take to the development opportunities on offer in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>In Saudi Arabia people are talking about hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of projects. This is something huge. It is also a significant challenge and responsibility, both for us and for the country, to ensure that these opportunities have a positive outcome. We really want to make sure that we come together and look at the best practices internationally, and try to utilize them in Saudi Arabia. We cannot just copy and paste. You have to learn and adapt to the local environment for it to be a sustainable development. There are a lot of people involved in this equation: it is a mix between the authorities and the service providers, and the ministries and the actual operators. If you want to make a healthcare city, you have to make sure that there are certain guidelines present for the building and the operation. The way to go forward is to have design and build, as well as turnkey approaches. This process eliminates most of the issues because when you are a designer and a project is handed over to a client who hires another contractor, there will be miscommunication about what to do with this design. When it is a design and build project, the collaborative team wants to work at its best to reach the same objective, and will try to solve problems from within. Saudi Arabia is going through this boom at the same time as it is trying to take care of its younger generation and give them the best education and support it can. I am one of these people. My duty is to make sure that everything I do and am involved in considers their interests. For us, a building is not an end goal, but a part of an integrated infrastructure that gives back to the people afterwards. People should start looking at growth using an integrated model, and we are part of that design and build turnkey services right from the beginning.</p><div class="quote">“In Saudi Arabia people are talking about hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of projects."</div><h4>What are your main short-term goals?</h4><p>Part of our focus now is regional, in particular Egypt because it has a very interesting market even though it has had some issues recently. Despite this, we believe Egypt is really a treasure here in the region because it has a lot of professional human capital. It has a demand and a need to add more supply. In addition to Egypt, we are thinking about focusing more on North Africa. In terms of Saudi Arabia, we hope to grow with our experience by tapping into design and build projects in the country. We want to grow by being selective, not by throwing ourselves into any and every project, because as a professional you have a duty to be realistic in your approach and deliver on what you promised. In 2015, we want to make sure we seek out the projects going on in Riyadh and are part of developments we can add value to, specifically projects in the healthcare and education sectors. We want to start approaching projects using new models, thinking from a purpose point of view and thinking about what we can add. One new concept we are considering is the public-private partnership (PPP) model. We are thinking about collaborating on a design-and-build project, through a consortium, for example, and then transferring that on. The government is doing its best in terms of investing and monitoring, but it cannot do it all. The necessary projects are too large now and the government needs the support of the private sector, which offers a different point of view to that of the government. The government is always a given. It wants to give its people the best without looking at the bottom line, at how much they are spending. The private sector will never go into a venture without thinking about how much money it is going to make. The combination of the public and private approach works well from a macro and micro economic point of view. The government can act as a facilitator and ensure that the correct macro strategy is in place, as well as setting out the necessary guidelines and regulations, while private enterprise can develop specialized projects and add value to them for the benefit of all.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What customer services does Linde provide in Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>The majority of the business segments that we are engaged in can be clustered primarily into: Linde Engineering, which is the technology and execution arm of the group; Linde Gas, one of the world's leading industrial gasses suppliers with a considerable contribution to the group's revenue; and the Healthcare, a relatively new and very exciting field that has been augmented through a major acquisition in the US. Linde Engineering's business model is basically a technology-based EPC, meaning a comprehensive value proposition around our broad range of in-house technologies from upstream gas treatment, to midstream LNG, all the way to downstream in petrochemicals and chemicals. With its own specific market cycles, Linde Engineering has grown steadily over the past decade to revenues of between ‚¬3.5 to 4 billion. On the upstream side, we do natural gas treatment based on in-house and also external partnerships. Along that line comes nitrogen rejection units, sulfur recovery, and of course LPG extraction, which has been booming in the US thanks to the shale gas revolution. In the midstream segment, Linde is one of main players in the field of LNG technology. In this field and in addition to mega projects, we focus on midsize and smaller-scale opportunities that have their own momentum fueled by the era of distributed energy and enhanced monetization of the gas reserves. Downstream petrochemicals are also a focus market segment for Linde Engineering, built around several in-house patented technologies and innovative solutions that are aimed at adding value to our customers' operations. There are several flagship projects to mention here, but a lighthouse accomplishment in Abu Dhabi is Borouge III, the world's largest ethane cracker. It is undergoing the final steps of completion with a significant track record of safety and execution. I believe the relationship here has been very successful and transformative and we are proud to have been working closely with Borouge and ADNOC on this prestigious project. The strategic partnership between Linde and ADNOC goes beyond, whereby an industrial gases joint venture, the Elixier, was established. It has been a considerable size of capital investment—around $1 billion—and a manifestation of the strong and trustful partnership.</p><h4>What are the main opportunities feedstock diversity offers to the industry in Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>It is absolutely significant. It could potentially become an opportunity. This is where we believe technology leadership and collaboration is key to the challenges ahead. The gas shortage became a reality in the region. The ability to manage heavier feedstock, in particular liquids like Naphtha, is the bridge. The most interesting takeaway here is that technology not only enables also aims to make ventures more economically attractive. Linde is a leading player in this domain, on one side due to the decades of experience and excellence in liquid cracking and on the other side with new enhancing technologies and solutions. What we call it “value cracking" is a game-changing solution whereby optimization of the streams and derivatives in a liquid cracker creates more value that then enhances the economics of the system. There are other well-established trends, including the integration of the refinery and petrochemicals, which basically builds on feedstock synergies, scope, optimization, and, of course, cost synergies. In an ideal scenario, Takreer and Chemaweyaat may have an opportunity to build on these synergies.</p><div class="quote">“It is a stable business environment, with well-established infrastructure and systematically developed processes."</div><h4>What is your strategy in terms of R&amp;D?</h4><p>R&amp;D is beyond a priority for us in the hydrocarbon industry; it is more like a necessity to remain in the game. To be honest, this is not just a strategy for Linde Engineering, but for any technology-based company in this industry. If you want to lead the game, then you need to have a different game plan, or a combination of several initiatives. You have to build around existing developments to improve what you have and push the boundaries to make more out of the same. The second is disruptive innovation, whereby you go beyond by creating a solution for a challenge that previously had no solution. The third aspect is a hybrid of the two, whereby an evolution of an existing technology becomes a solution to a challenge.</p><h4>How would you assess your relationship with ADNOC?</h4><p>The industry has become so complex and volatile that, without trustful and successful partnerships, business ideas become more of a theory than a reality. Without a proper partnership, it is impossible to create value, to grow, and of course to succeed. When looking at ADNOC group, you see a very interesting and broad mix of opportunities, from upstream gas and LNG terminals all the way to downstream and petrochemicals. There is solid opportunity for collaboration and partnership, as we at Linde has attained, given its harmonized leadership, financial excellence, transparent strategy, and rich human resources. What Linde offers is the advanced technology, execution excellence, and know-how development. As part of our commitment to make ADNOC able to achieve its Emiratization targets, we have been training Emiratis and young talent and we are proud to see them growing into the next generation of leaders and experts. Our olefins academy has been a solid platform for this development and we are committed to continue with this.</p><h4>What does Abu Dhabi represent for Linde Engineering as a location?</h4><p>First and foremost, it is a stable business environment, with well-established infrastructure and systematically developed processes. It is easy to operate, and access to the human resources that you need is easy and also attracting the right people possible given what the country offers as a safe environment for people and their families to live in, which is a very important factor.</p><h4>What is your vision for the future of the EPC sector in the Middle East and the growth of Linde Engineering within that?</h4><p>I believe a new cycle has just started. It is associated with successful completion and coming on stream of megaprojects, enhancements in brown fields in the context of efficiency, sustainability, and process optimization, and, of course, operational excellence. On the other hand, technology-based developments such as oil to chemical, downstream integration, hydrogen networks and CO2 capture, and EOR free up natural gas and will likely gain more momentum. On the third-front comes an acceleration in the development of human capital. We are excited to be part of this journey. We are determined to continue our efforts in being a trusted technology partner to the industry. And we are well committed to contributing to the success of our customers and partners in developing their sustainable further development and expansion of their human capital in different parts of this region.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Since 1995, Oilserv has provided onshore and offshore services in Africa's oil and gas sector. Could you elaborate on the way your portfolio has developed over the years and the current flagship projects you are engaged in?<br></h4><p>We started operations fully in 1995, and worked exclusively for Shell over the next five years. After this, we diversified into working for other IOCs and for Nigerian LNG in maintaining their pipeline transmission systems. We are recognized for our strong technical background based on my vision and experience. I have worked for Schlumberger worldwide, and I returned to Nigeria in 1994 with the vision of building the country's capacity in oil and gas technical services. We started by building flow lines for Shell and eventually began building trunk lines and pipelines for them, after which we started building facilities like manifold stations, including the largest such facility in Nigeria. We have grown to the point where our service delivery covers entire pipelines and flow lines of all sizes. The vast majority of pipelines we construct today are actually gas, rather than oil pipelines, as more and more gas pipelines are being built as distributions systems throughout the country. We are the primary indigenous construction company in this sector, having built over 30 pipelines, far exceeding the number that any other indigenous company has created. Oilserv is the only Nigerian company with the capacity to construct 10 pipeline projects simultaneously, and we are currently working on nine. On top of that, we are building a 48-inch diameter pipeline, which will be Africa's largest. We are talking about a full EPC contract, including maintenance for the four months following construction, which is a capacity that no other contractor can ensure. We employ more than 500 people and our activities are spread all across Nigeria, and we also run additional operations in other African countries.</p><h4>How did you manage to position the company as the only indigenous company to provide world-class services?</h4><p>Capacity building is the key. I have a strong engineering background; therefore, Oilserv is driven by my vision as an engineer. We started well before the Local Content Act was passed, and were already competing with international companies, getting jobs, and delivering these efficiently. The high quality of our delivery has given us a strong track record, but it is not just about the delivery, as we are cost-effective, too. We deliver far cheaper results than the multinationals can, and our robust engineering background is the reason for this. From inception, we have trained our people in using a range of heavy-duty and specialized equipment, and we continue to do this. We choose between 30 and 40 graduates annually for our graduate program. As part of Nigeria's university curriculum today is not adapted to specific industries, we have to guide graduates in the right direction in the oil and gas industry, whereby we build capacity internally and train people to instill in them our culture of quality delivery, which is the only way to please clients. We are always abreast of the latest technology in pipeline construction. We are one of the few companies with the capacity to deploy and operate horizontal directional drilling systems that enable us to preserve ecosystems, and the first to deploy automatic and semi automatic welding systems on a large scale, when 90% of today's welding systems are still manual. This significantly increases the amount of joints we can weld in a day. Furthermore, we have brought more Volvo PL pipe layers to Nigeria, and so capacity building and technological advancement has brought us to where we are today. Moreover, we reinvest in our business, resulting in a huge asset base spread over a large area, and our ability to handle this many projects at the same time.</p><h4>How can the Nigerian petroleum industry become a driver of sustainable economic growth?</h4><p>We need to have a good system for the management of the industry and must implement a regulatory system that is fit for this purpose; one that adapts to the environment and to changes within the global oil and gas industry. Over the past five years, for example, the impact of US shale gas production has been significant. Similarly, the crisis of 2008 impacted heavily on the oil and gas business. To offset external influences such as these, we need to adapt and strategize based on a long-term perspective. This requires proper management at a national level. Unfortunately, in most developing countries, the government tends to have a disproportionate level of control over the industry. Instead, it should be run as both a government activity and as a business, which can be difficult, as politics and commerce do not always go hand-in-hand unless there is a proper focus. This is not specific to Nigeria. Proper planning, and most importantly, an ability to build up capacity in the service industry will mitigate these effects. Only then are you transferring wealth to the country, because capacity is being built sustainably, while also developing technological capabilities within the industry that can be sustained and even exported.</p><h4>Does the recent IOC divestment play into this by creating room for local capacity building?</h4><p>On face value, it is encouraging for Nigerian players. However, this is E&amp;P, which is a different issue, and will require huge investment to increase the capacity of the reserve in order to create value. We need to create a long-term development plan for this. What has happened is excellent, and as you can see there are Nigerian players involved in E&amp;P. These players have to build capacity and spread wealth within the country, and it will also help Nigeria to take full control of certain activities within the oil and gas industry. Overall, however, more has to be done in the long term.</p><h4>Will the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) contribute positively to this future development?</h4><p>Whether or not it is passed, the industry cannot exist in a vacuum, so we will continue moving. It is better for the industry if the PIB is passed, because both capacity building by the IOCs and the local companies will be impaired if not. Nigeria needs the IOCs and the IOCs need Nigeria. The fact that Shell is divesting does not mean that they have stopped building capacity. They are bringing in new technology and dealing with the big offshore fields, and they have the capacity to spend billions of dollars and also benefit from it. It is a win-win for both Nigeria and the IOCs.</p><h4>What goals have you set for Oilserv over the next five years?</h4><p>Over the coming four years, we want to expand into all Sub-Saharan Africa. Today, we have a footprint in Sierra Leone and Togo, and are setting up in Benin. Our operations in Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania are part of a geographical expansion in alignment with our goal to balance our portfolio across the region and take full advantage of our experience and capacity.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did Energia Limited become a pioneer of indigenous oil and gas companies?<br></h4><p>Energia started as an idea shared by certain key members of the Petroleum Technology Association of Nigeria (PETAN) to utilize indigenous capacity and local content to manage an exploration and production (E&amp;P) company. The founding companies include Oildata, Weltek, Sowsco, Ciscon, Skangix, and Ariboil. Others included Pemec, IDD, Ashbert, and ISK, which is a law firm owned by renowned security officer Chief A.K. Horsfall, who is also the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Energia. The company was awarded the Ebendo and Obodoeti marginal fields in the 2003 bidding rounds in a joint venture with Oando by the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR), with Energia Limited as the designated Operator in a 55/45 split in favor of Energia. Operations started in 2008, leading to the first oil in December 2009 after Energia's in-house technology group, in collaboration with other local contractors, revamped an already abandoned Total well. The company has since carried out further field development with the back-to-back drilling and completion of four wells between 2012 and 1Q2014 to bring field production capacity to around 10,000 bbl/d, with a technical allowable 8,000 bbl/d by the DPR. We are presently embarking on an alternate crude evacuation route through a new 53-km, 12-inch pipeline to the Forcados terminal with a member of our cluster company in Delta State. This will free all locked-in crude potential due to restrictions through Agip's Brass Oil Export Terminal. As a company, we are locking in about 5,000-6,000 bbl/d, while the entire cluster of Midwestern, Pillar Oil, and Platform Petroleum with Energia is locking in around 15,000 bbl/d. Besides the export and production restrictions, we also suffer high crude theft ca. 20%-25% of daily injection, which over the past two years has amounted to a $200 million loss for the four companies in the cluster. It is as a result of these restrictions and theft, plus the anticipation of a possible global crude glut due to growth in shale oil, that propelled our move for a mini 10,000 bbl/d refinery within our area of operation.</p><h4>What is Energia's core objective?</h4><p>Our objective is to be the first indigenous company to build a standard crude oil refinery plant. Studies are already underway in Houston with one of the top refining companies. Energia is a success story that was hardly known before. Now, we are becoming a household name in the indigenous E&amp;P industry in Nigeria, and are creating a brand of integrity. We want to set up a local company with an international outlook in terms of transparency in our processes. In terms of success, I think we are one of the most successful because we were able to drill four wells back-to-back, which is unique for an indigenous company. We have lined up a work program for 2015 and 2016. Our target by 2016-2017 is to post 20,000 bbl/d of production. Our only current limitation is the pipeline export restriction. We can only inject 3,000 bbl/d, and, frankly, this is the major challenge we have since we invested $150 million in drilling and completing the wells and tying the flow lines to the flow station. Therefore, we created a joint venture with another independent company, Midwestern, to construct an alternate pipeline to another export terminal. This pipe will soon have the first oil put through it, and it will give Energia, Midwestern, and a cluster of other companies the ability to pump 66,000 bbl/d; of this 21,000 bbl/d will pass through Agip's Brass Terminal, and 45,000 bbl/d through this line to Shell's Forcados Terminal. Between Energia and Midwestern alone we are locking in somewhere between 15,000 bbl/d and 17,000 bbl/d because of the pipeline restriction.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the Nigerian Local Content Act?</h4><p>It is fantastic for the oil and gas industry because Nigeria is growing. There are about 175 million Nigerians, with a projection to reach about 450 million by 2050. With such a population explosion, unemployment will be a major issue, which must be a priority for any government. Oil and gas are non-renewable, and Nigeria must take full advantage of this industry to diversify the economy. Nigerian content is for those who are present now and those who are yet to be born. If Nigeria has 250 million or 400 million people, we will need to employ all of them, otherwise we will face difficulty. In the next 20 or 30 years, we need to move the economy out of this developing state and into a developed one. We need to engage the entire population. Considerable success has been achieved by the board in this regard. The good news, also, is that other sectors and ministries in the country are adopting the Oil and Gas Nigerian Content Act model. Such growth in Nigerian content in other sectors will bring rapid industrialization of the economy. Nigeria is the country that can do this for Africa. Currently, we have an infrastructure deficit, but there is pressure from around globe for Nigeria to reverse this, as Africa and West Africa look at Nigeria for leadership in this direction.</p><h4>You want to industrialize, yet not at the expense of local communities, as Energia values giving back to those communities impacted by local oil&amp;gas operations. Could you tell us more about that?</h4><p>Energia's model is unique and second to none in the industry. I found that if you share resources, you win over the people. We dedicate about 4% of our gross production and provide 3% to sustainable projects, and are well liked by all parties. The communities have come appreciate our sincerity. When they have a problem, we share it. Our model has moved away from the benefactor-beneficiary scenario to the stakeholder and partnership model. We have created a trust fund with our proceeds to superintend the development of these communities. We have also set up a company/community parliament system that engages a wider group of communities in an interactive setting to discuss any and all issues concerning the environment. We also encourage young people to incorporate limited liability companies that can be mentored into growth, and this we have been doing since 2009.</p><h4>What is your vision for the future of the Nigerian oil and gas sector?</h4><p>The Nigerian oil and gas industry will drive the economy in terms of the opportunities we can create. The Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), when passed, will provide transparency and accountability, and, frankly, we do not have a choice if we are to compete globally. As part of this vision, the government is privatizing the power sector, and we are also opening up the midstream and downstream operations; rather than selling crude natural resources, which are hallmarks of developing economies, we will refine and process our natural resources and export finished products. I see Nigeria in 20 years, if we hold out, and I know we will, becoming relevant in every global engagement. That is my vision for Nigeria. In every area of trade, technology, industry, and education, the Nigerian opinion will be sought after.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Model Operation]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[model-operation]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the core of your business, and how do you differentiate yourselves from the competition in those fields of activity?<br></h4><p>The core of the business is actually engineering and technical services for the oil, gas, LNG, and petrochemical industries. We started the business on the back of providing Nigerian content. In the past, an adequate level of expertise was not available in the country, whereby most of the qualified work was undertaken by foreign employees. We started thinking about how to make local workers productive, and get them the exposure they needed. The government understood that goal and officially signed the Nigerian Content Act. So the major differentiator for us is that ours is a Nigerian company playing in an environment that is mostly a domain for multinationals. Of course, we offer more competitive pricing, and we add value by training local engineers. At the end of the day, we see the development of a hub of expertise that can actually serve the Gulf of Guinea region, which stretches from Mauritania to Mozambique.</p><h4>How has the Nigerian Content Act changed the industry, and what has changed for your business?</h4><p>The Act has changed the industry considerably. Yet, we are still not where we are supposed to be in terms of the economic activities coming out of the Nigeria. We are still low on capacity. We do have enough engineers, but some so-called engineers are not trainable. In some cases, this is because the education system is still focused on theory, as opposed to practice. However over time, the Act will generate the desired effect. We have multiplied our turnover by almost 30 over the past five to six years, simply because we were given the opportunity to do things locally. It was easier for us to key into that opportunity and drive it forward.</p><h4>How can the government support you in terms of training people for the future?</h4><p>You cannot leave this to the government alone. We, as private entities, also need to play a role. As a matter of fact, we knew just recently that there is an industrial training fund set up by the government to ensure that, when you train your workers, you can either assess them or else have some money reimbursed for training and development. I think there is a need for government awareness, so that companies know that training is not just going to come from the bottom line. In the end, there is going to be a partnership between the private sector and the government.</p><h4>What kind of model do you operate for collaboration with partners?</h4><p>Our model is truly simple, and based on understanding where the markets are. There is no problem setting up a facility closer to the region that we are trying to sell to. But if the market is predominantly Nigeria, then I really think that the best option is to sell our product in Nigeria. What we will not do is to simply be an agent collecting a commission. We feel that if we know there is value to be added by Nigerians, and there are projects going on here in Nigeria, we want to go into partnership. What we also saw was that, with very good engineers coming out of Nigeria, potential partners were even coming to us to work together in the region. We did work on the Chad-Cameroon pipeline project. Makon also worked on the West African Gas Pipeline Project, with our engineers in Benin, Togo, and Ghana. It has been a successful model for our partners, because when they have issues, suddenly there are engineers who know how to address them. Our engineers are predominantly from here, so they do not go to other regions. For clients, they have been able to have resources closer at hand. They can call us and we are just a couple of miles away. Also, it is cheaper for them. For an engineer in Nigeria, in this locality, we are not going to charge you the expert rate prevailing in Houston or Calgary. We charge local rates, but the staff is nonetheless well trained. Meanwhile, we add value for our stakeholders as well: the country, the shareholders, and individuals.</p><h4>Are you actively looking for partnerships or collaborations?</h4><p>In the oil industry, technology is not stagnant. Companies are always developing new models. I think that building trust is important, and it is also good for our partners to see that value is being created here. Makon has been working with Rockwell Automation for a long time, and the same thing goes for ABB Nigeria.</p><h4>Where do you see the next opportunities in the gas industry?</h4><p>There is great potential for growth, and Nigeria remains low on gas. We see growth in that area, and feel that if the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) is passed appropriately, it could open up the playing field. Also, the energy sector has huge potential if you look at how many Nigerians are still lacking a sufficient energy supply. And with a population of approximately 170 million people, if you develop a middle class, that represents a huge market in itself. We observed this in the telecoms sector. That market opened up slowly, but eventually Nigeria became a magnet for innovation when the momentum picked up. We believe wholeheartedly in this environment. I have been abroad to observe the industry, but we feel that there is huge local potential. And we will also have the opportunity to transform the country into the hub for the Gulf of Guinea.</p><h4>What would you change in the regulatory framework for the oil and gas sector?</h4><p>Passing the PIB would change the landscape. And if you take the electricity sector, for example, I believe this government has done the hard work, by ensuring that the distribution and generating companies have been privatized. What I have seen over the past year and a half is that an entity such as the Nigerian Gas Company would perpetually owe something for its gas supply. Today, they pay for gas supply, because the end customer is no longer the government, but private entities. That act in itself has removed the dislocation in that sector. Once the PIB passes many elements will fall into place.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-writing-on-the-wall]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does technological advancement help in terms of your company's innovativeness?<br></h4><p>Innovation has taken us to where we are today. Over the years we have pioneered products that have been able to engage and interact with advertisers and consumers. We were the first to pioneer the largest freestanding billboard in Africa, at 1,200 sqm. Currently, we also have the largest freestanding digital platform in Sub-Saharan Africa. The digital platform of about 510 sqm is more than just a billboard. It is a platform that you can tweet on, as well as send dynamic messages, and scroll messages. The platform also displays the current time and temperature. It is highly interactive and engaging, and is earning numerous accolades in the industry. We were not the first to go into the digital out-of-home displays, so we did not have the first-mover advantage. Without that, you face numerous challenges. To engage the customer, you need to target the audience as consumer tastes continuously change. Our focus is not only on the competition, but also on targeting brands like Google, Comcast, or Facebook.</p><h4>There is a huge problem here with power supply, and innovation requires a lot of power. How are you dealing with the power issue?</h4><p>There is, indeed, an issue with power. The government has privatized the power sector, but the problem persists. Our digital sign is always on, and is powered for 19 hours every day. There are two 250 kVA generators on that site, and there is also a transformer for direct power supply from the National Grid of PHCN. This incurs huge cost, but such are the circumstances.</p><h4>What is your client profile, and how are their needs and expectations evolving?</h4><p>The market contains the prominent segments of telecoms, FMCG, banking, and the breweries, and we are in business with all of them. In some cases, a client may prefer exclusivity to sharing the platform, which requires deep pockets. This is why it is so important that we remain innovative, as innovation allows you to determine your price, and elevates you beyond the realm of the mere commodity.</p><h4>How difficult is it to get the kinds of permits you require to operate in this segment?</h4><p>The permits and approvals to erect some of these installations vary from state to state. The regulator in Lagos is the Lagos State Signage and Advertisement Agency (LASAA) and apart from being our regulator LASAA also levies taxes. So the balance between regulation and proceeds is there, as are the permits. What happens is that if you have a location in mind, you apply to the agency, which guides you through the processes and procedures for approval. The location could be private or it could be on the highway, for example. After you apply, there is a joint feasibility inspection. What I can say is that the agency responsible for regulating our industry is open to innovation.</p><h4>This has been specifically about Lagos, but you are also present in Abuja and Port Harcourt. Could you elaborate on your operations there?</h4><p>Whatever starts in Lagos will eventually spread to the rest of the country. There is the Department of Outdoor Advertising &amp; Signage (DOAS) in Abuja regulating the Federal Capital Territory. Regulatory agencies operate in all states. We are a nationwide company and have a good relationship with the regulatory agencies. We have identified the commercial hubs of Nigeria, which are Port Harcourt, Lagos, and Abuja, and those are the areas where our regional business units are located.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[ship-to-shore]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you provide us with an insight into the mandate you have been given?<br></h4><p>In shipping, there are those who provide shipping services, and those who utilize them. The two groups are not on an equal footing. The carriers, large financial institutions, and banks are organized and financially robust. On the other hand, the shippers and owners of the cargo are fragmented and often represent small businesses. So there is a tendency for the latter group to be exploited. The government needs to regulate the industry such that both sides can play by the same rules, and shippers' councils worldwide are the spokesperson of shippers. But, over the years, most councils have assumed a form of neutrality, as in practice they represent all parties. As the foremost shippers' council in Africa, this is what the NSC has been doing. The Council is well recognized and respected in the industry for its experience. Accordingly, in February 2014, the President reaffirmed the NSC's appointment as an economic regulator for the shipping industry.</p><h4>Why did it take the government time to appoint an economic regulator for Nigeria's ports?</h4><p>To some extent, the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) has handled technical and economic regulations. However, as the NPA also provides services, neutrality is ultimately compromised. Besides, even the concession agreement signed with the private sector has made provision for economic regulation. The ports in Nigeria have achieved efficiency, although there are still some problems, including arbitrary and unilateral ties of one side. Moreover, there is nobody to measure compliance with agreements. Additionally, the clearance procedure for cargo must be international. As a result, there is a greater need for economic regulations, and the government has appointed the Council to ensure this.</p><h4>How would you assess your success as an economic regulator?</h4><p>While it is too early to say, the NSC is well recognized by owners in an area of business that was historically laissez-faire in nature, and where you would expect private-sector resistance to a new regulator. In order to acquire a buy-in of all stakeholders, we have been holding expansive consultations with stakeholders where there was acknowledgement and recognition of NSC as a neutral arbiter. Our efforts have been successful; we have been negotiating with service providers and government alike. And now, we are not so much on the side of the shippers as playing a paternal role to all parties. We have to work with the terminal operators, shipping companies, and freight forwarders, as well as Nigerian Customs, the Port Authority, and many other agencies, because our aim is to develop Nigeria into a preferred destination for cargo. Nigerian ports and terminals are in competition with other ports in the neighborhood and we have to attract cargo. Therefore, we are streamlining procedures, such that shippers will have no choice but to bring goods to Nigerian ports because of their efficiency.</p><h4>NIMASA and NPA are technical regulators. As an economic regulator, how do you make sure that the three organizations do not interfere in each other's affairs?</h4><p>The scopes of their respective areas' remits are well delineated. The NPA is the landlord in charge of specific tasks such as common-use facilities, access roads, and dredging the channels. We are concerned with tariffs, and the process of cargo clearance at the ports. Automation is the solution to most of these problems. Our ports cannot have primitive clearance systems because we have to reduce the dwell time for cargo moving through them. We want cargo to be evacuated as soon as it arrives at the port, as a port is a transit point, not a storage facility. Nigeria's ports need international processes and procedures for this, which means more than trade facilities. Electronic portals will solve these problems, and we are currently advocating this. The new deep-sea ports will also go a long way toward solving the congestion problems that we are currently facing at our ports.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Since the beginning of this century, Africa has demonstrated strong economic vitality, maintained overall social stability, and emerged as a "pole" of the world in three ways. First, Africa is home to 54 countries, increasingly "speaking with one voice" and playing an ever-growing role in the governance of global affairs. Africa has thus become a major pole in the world political arena. Second, Africa has a total population of one billion and an economic aggregate of over $2 trillion. Of the world's ten fastest growing economies in 2013, seven are in Africa, which indicates its growing weight in the developing world. Africa is, therefore, also a major pole in global economic growth. Third, with more than 1,500 ethnic groups and over 2,000 different languages, Africa is rich in cultural heritage. In the international political and economic landscape, it is always better to have more "poles" than fewer "poles." The rise of Africa as a new pole will only make the world more democratic, stable, dynamic, and colorful, and better facilitate peace, development, and progress in the world.<br></p><p>Inclusive growth refers to employment, fairness, and balanced development in a country. It also refers to balanced development among countries and regions. The mutually beneficial cooperation between China and Africa contributes to the well being of more than 2.4 billion people and more balanced growth of the world economy. This in itself is the most significant inclusive growth in the world. Africa is the continent with the largest number of developing countries. Despite the economic takeoff in many African countries, daunting challenges remain, such as weak infrastructure, underemployment, and poverty. China is the biggest developing country in terms of population and size. China and Africa face many similar problems and share the same task of growing the economy, raising living standards, and promoting social progress. It is encouraging that China-Africa cooperation has and will continue to drive inclusive growth among developing countries. Given the fact that China and Africa are at similar stages of development, they have much to gain from each other's development. China's robust economic growth has brought with it massive exports of African goods and provided strong support for Africa's growth. The enormous potential of Africa's economy has attracted Chinese investment here and has provided greater room for China's own economic development. Africa needs infrastructure and industrial development, whereas China has the spare financing and production capacity in these fields. Cooperation based on such complementarity and mutual benefit will give an even stronger boost to China and Africa's respective development. The China-Africa relationship has stood the test of time and continues to grow from strength to strength. This is a relationship of steadfast mutual support, common development, and mutual learning. Our respect for each other, cultural exchanges, and sharing of development experience is a blessing for our respective development and global prosperity.</p><p>China-Africa relations are facing a new historical opportunity. China will work with Africa to put in place a new framework of four principles, six areas, and one platform for advancing China-Africa cooperation. To be specific, we will follow the four principles of treating each other with sincerity and as equals, enhancing solidarity and mutual trust, and jointly pursuing inclusive development as well as innovative and practical cooperation. We will carry out industrial cooperation, financial cooperation, cooperation on poverty reduction, cooperation on environmental protection, cultural and people-to-people exchanges, and cooperation on peace and security. And we will make good use of the platform of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation. We will upgrade China-Africa cooperation in response to new development needs of Africa and elevate our new type of strategic partnership to a new level. China will continue to prioritize infrastructural development in its cooperation with Africa. We will work with Africa to upgrade and build transport infrastructure and to promote connectivity on the African continent in the areas of railways, expressways, and aviation.</p><p>Cooperation between China and African countries is based on good faith and complete openness. China is ready to share its advanced and applicable technologies and management expertise with African countries without any reservation. China is ready to accept the form of joint venture agreements with the African side on all projects that it participates in constructing or operating. China is also ready to step up its collaboration with international organizations and relevant countries to make a joint contribution to Africa's development.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the success of the unbundling of the Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN)?<br></h4><p>The unbundling of PHCN was the outcome of the federal government's reform initiatives, and was part of its transformation agenda. It followed a pattern that had already been developed for telecommunications. The reform initiatives abrogated the monopoly law, liberalized the sector, and created a regulatory agency. The reforms will be considered successful if they delineate three major strategic rules: policy formulation, regulation, and operations in the sector. What we formerly had in place was the NEPA Act, which created a monopoly for the National Electric Power Authority (NEPA) authorizing it to undertake all activities within the sector, from generation to transmission and distribution. If electricity didn't reach my area, and I decided to provide cables, poles, and transformers to take the power to my community, those assets became the assets of NEPA, according to the monopoly act. Therefore, the primary significance of the reform was its abrogation of the NEPA Act. That is why we had to establish the PHCN as a transition vehicle to allow the unbundling of NEPA into successor companies, where the main objective of the unbundling was to foster competition. It was critical to ensure full revenue collection in the value chain as failure to do so would leave the sector with no chance of survival. When NEPA was an integrated company with transmission, generation, and distribution under one entity, those who generated power did not care if they collected the proceeds from the end user. The generation department generated the power and brought it to the grid, while the transmission people were indifferent as to whether X amount of power was lost and, by extension, in distribution, the operators did not care if they collected the full value of the power transmitted. As a result, over the years, there were huge revenue leakages in the value chain. The government covered any shortfall, and any further investment to improve the system had to come from its budget. Now, with the reform, the generation and distribution components of the business have been separated, and only transmission remains in government hands. The power generation part of NEPA was broken down into six power generation companies, and many independent power producers have invested in the sector. In the distribution sector, monopoly pricing has been abolished thanks to the newly competitive nature of the sector, and the former distribution giant has been broken down into 11 distribution companies based in different regions and areas. Now, we can surmise which distribution companies are engaged in best practices, and ensure that the others play according to the same rules and apply the same standards to their operations. Generation is straightforward; you install a generator and crank up the power. But because of the risk of power losses in transmission and distribution, we decided to introduce an intervening party, the Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trader, which signs power-purchase agreements with the generation companies. The aim was to avoid disincentivizing power generating companies from investing in the power generation sector. The Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trader basically guarantees that whatever power a company generates is bought and paid for in full. Meanwhile, the distribution companies were not sold on the basis of price, but on the commitment made to reduce aggregate technical and financial collection losses. After the unbundling, a regulatory agency was also set up, which has the power to grant and revoke licenses. This controls and ensures good behavior in terms of environmental issues, the appropriateness of technologies employed, safety standards, and more. Most importantly, it provides a one-stop shop for anyone who wants to enter the generation or distribution sector. Another issue that the reforms addressed was pricing. Previously, under NEPA, the government had been subsidizing power for the public sector. It was, therefore, not economically viable for any private sector entity to invest its own capital and set up a generation or distribution plant. One of the major challenges prior to privatization was to figure out a tariff that was cost-reflective and that could yield an adequate rate of return on the investments of those wishing to enter the sector. This was done through the introduction of the Multi-Year Tariff Order (MYTO 2) in 2012. It provided the added confidence that investors needed to invest in the power sector.</p><h4>In what other sectors do you see opportunities for liberalization?</h4><p>Our next focus area will be the transportation sector; the inefficiency of which today means that transport costs account for an average of 30% of all costs on transported goods and products. As with the NEPA Act, we have the Railway Act, the Inland Waterways Act, and the Ports and Harbor Act, all of which restrict operations and grant monopoly rights in those sectors. Meanwhile, in the pipeline, we have a railway draft reform bill, an inland waterways draft reform bill, a roads reform bill, and a ports and harbor reform bill. We will also establish a regulatory agency called the National Transport Commission to provide intermodal regulation and promote intermodal development, such as ensuring that major airports have railway links. Another focus area besides transport is the reform of the housing sector. It is estimated that the middle class alone demands a minimum of 17 million housing units. Right now, we are looking at what policies and legal and regulatory frameworks we need to put in place to encourage massive private sector housing investment. We are also working on the privatization of development finance institutions, such as the Bank of Industry and the Bank of Agriculture, in which privatization has already begun. Also, under the leadership of the Minister of Finance, we are working on the establishment of a wholesale development bank. There is also the Abuja Commodities and Stock Exchange project, through which we intend to introduce a warehouse depository system. Currently, the Abuja Commodities and Stock Exchange only has a trading platform; therefore, we have gone into advanced discussions with the Ministry of Agriculture, which has warehouses and silos located nationwide. It is set to cede a number of those silos to the Abuja Commodities and Stock Exchange for privatization. Two factors have been hindering the development of agriculture in Nigeria: one, the instability and unpredictability of prices; and two, the lack of a defined buyer. This initiative will thus seek to introduce a stable system for pricing and for identifying certain buyers. Another crucial sector is the minerals and mining sector. Nigeria has large mineral deposits that are virtually untapped. Coal, gold, columbite, and limestone are all present, but today we extract only oil and gas. Now, however, we are working on removing the obstacles that seem to be holding investors back from entering those sectors. Refineries are also up for privatization, pending an amicable resolution of labor issues. We are also looking at a concession of the Nigerian Gas Company and the Nigerian pipelines, which transport gas and petroleum products. The other sectors that I wanted to mention are tourism and sports. Nigeria has considerable potential to become a tourist destination when you consider that, among others we have both game and national parks. These have not been major revenue earners as yet; therefore, we are looking at how we might transform these assets into profitable ventures that will attract private investors. In terms of sports, we have stadia all over the country and a population of 160 million that loves football.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the role of the Nigeria Export Processing Zones Authority (NEPZA), and how does it function within the current context of the Nigerian economy?<br></h4><p>Once the government realized that there was no single agency responsible for national industrialization, it was decided that NEPZA would hold this additional mandate. Several things must happen to ensure this. First, the enabling act that set up NEPZA needs to be reviewed. That process has begun by order of the National Assembly. One key aspect that we noticed was that many of the jobs were done by too many people, whereby there was no ownership of the process, which curbed the taking of responsibility. Therefore, we restructured and pruned down the departments. We created the compliance and enforcement department to be fully responsible for the end-to-end compliance and enforcement of various policies, aligned to the incentives we have given. Then, we separated the free zones into public and private entities. The idea is that you have one director responsible in each area who sees things end-to-end from the beginning with marketing to bringing those people on board, registering them, providing incentives, and ensuring that they are complying with incentives and paying all relevant dues and fees. They are also responsible for training. Furthermore, NEPZA will be renamed the Nigeria Industrialization and Free Zone Agency (NIDZA) once all approvals have been made. There are two key policies that will drive industrialization. One is the Nigeria Industrial Revolution Plan, and the second is the National Enterprises and Development Program (NEDEP). Those two government policies are anchored in the President's transformation agenda. Supplementary to these programs are the Sugar Policy and the Automotive Policy. Our mandate has been expanded, and we no longer solely focus on free zones, but also on industrial cities and industrial parks. This means the whole appraisal process of the old free zone has to be amended, more checklists have to be put in, and it has to be more robust. Prior to this time, the President had stopped approving free zones since he was not seeing their benefit. For the first nine months, I had to do a complete appraisal of why the free zones were not working. Within a few months of coming on board with the new checklist and the new structure, we had received three approvals from the President. It has lead to the birth of the first industrial city approval, and concerned the Gas Revolution Industrial Park in Ogidigben.</p><h4>You identified certain key sectors that are particularly promising for future development. What is their importance, and what will be the role of NEPZA in these sectors?</h4><p>The US is our largest buyer. Soon, it will not need our oil because of shale gas fracturing, and the discovery of crude in Ghana. Ghana will offer a discount, or else offer buyers delayed payment terms. Therefore, Nigeria has started looking at different sectors of the economy where we have comparative and competitive advantages. Agriculture is an area we need to focus on. We also need to look at the oil and gas sector in a constructive manner, as we should not be exporting crude. We are exporting it to countries that have their own refineries that create jobs for their own people. We need to do it all end-to-end, and take the byproducts of the crude. A NEPZA-operated zone will have industry, skills workshops, and SMEs, and will become the hub that everyone has to connect to. I want my zones to rank among the top-50 zones in the world. I want a line confirming that 15% percent of manufacturing is coming from these zones.</p><h4>What will be your strategies and priorities? What will you do to achieve this? What kind of projects and incentives do you plan for?</h4><p>We have restructured and plugged the loopholes, looked at the free zone, and seen what is working and what is not. Of the 25 free zones, 10 are functional, nine are under construction, and six are dormant. The six that are dormant are state run. I told my staff from those states that it was a shame that their state did not make proper use of its free zone license. As a result, the governments of the dormant zones are currently talking to me regarding investments. Years ago, industrial parks and industrial cities were created in this country, but they died with the government. They still exist and some manufacturing is happening. We did research around the country on the viability of these industrial parks. In partnership with the government, we are identifying the old industrial parks and cities to see if we can jump start them. We are trying to realize a highly innovative new vision. This involves the concept of the Nigeria International Financial Center, based on the Dubai International Finance Centre, which will be located within our free zones. The objective is to motivate Nigerians to transfer their funds back to Nigeria to set up industries, because currently 80% to 90% of total Nigerian funds are located beyond the country. The New Financial Policy will increase development and industrialization.</p><h4>Where do you see Nigeria in the next five years and how will it be achieved?</h4><p>I am a Nigerian, and I love the country that has done so much for me; I need to give something important back. The President has four years to showcase advancement. One quick way to jump start the economy is to use the free zones, industrial parks, and industrial cities. Since I have that responsibility, I see myself as the President's number one ally in this. I will assist in his success. For me to succeed, I have to come up with a clear strategy and make sure it is executed. The problem with Nigeria has never been strategy. We have the best strategies in the world, but they do not get executed, which is a situation I am trying to reverse. What I am doing is not new, and the only thing difference is that for the first time somebody from the private sector and who understands generating revenue is running the agency as a business that needs to make profit while running effectively.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Your company is promoted as having the one-stop-shop concept. Can you elaborate on the advantages this concept brings to your company?<br></h4><p>Intels, a subsidiary of Orlean, is Nigeria's leader in providing logistics services to the oil and gas industry. It manages three ports in Nigeria on behalf of the government, namely Onne, Warri, and Calabar. Intels has a concession created with the government through a public-private partnership (PPP), which started in 2006. Even though the concessions only started then, PPPs were already in place between Intels and the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA). Thus, in a way, the government utilized an existing successful working relationship. When we arrived in the early 1980s, the logistics challenge lay in the fact that each company had its own base scattered widely. It was not the best solution, because each new company coming to Nigeria first had to acquire a block, and then had to meet office and housing needs, as well as perform seismic activities and commence exploration. If they were able to find something commercially viable, which of course depends on the size of the field; for example, they would have required support from a shore base. Most materials required in the oil and gas industry need to be imported from Europe, the US, Asia, and Brazil. All of these materials require clearance by the NPA for security and revenue reasons. The materials were coming to the port, and later transferred to a base. This begs the question of why the moment you receive your cargo at a port, you would again transfer the material, which at the end of the day incurs additional costs and increases the risk of damage.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on the future plans for the Onne oil and gas free zone?</h4><p>For Phase 4A, which was completed and commissioned in 2013, we reclaimed 900 acres of land from the water. Another important investment for the Onne oil and gas free zone is represented by Phase 4B, which totaled $3 billion and was made by Deep Offshore Services Nigeria. The purpose of the project is to develop a further 3 km of jetties, and 3.5 km of differently engineered jetties. Basically, these jetties will have longer lifespans than others, and here the depth is a mere 8m. Hence, there will be a dedicated area for the fabrication of infrastructure for offshore modules, such as jackets, and so on. Therefore, an 8m draft is more than sufficient, as materials will be sent out on barges.</p><h4>How is the government working to diversify the economy?</h4><p>I do not envisage the Nigerian government diversifying. There might be many initiatives, but they have not been implemented. The Petroleum Industry Bill is a good example. While its ratification date remains unclear, it is nonetheless of significance, especially for oil producing companies because it entails their payment of royalties and taxation. If approved, it would be of great significance for these entities. One could debate whether it is fair for Nigeria, the country that owns all of this oil, to generate further revenues. Until the law emerges, the oil producing companies will not invest, as they are to commit to multi-billion dollar projects without knowing whether in a few months their tax rates may or may not skyrocket. There are only a few projects going forward. When Nigeria complains that there are not enough foreign investors, they should look in the mirror and ask themselves the reason. All international companies, producers, or service companies are merely watching and observing the developments. It is quite normal that during an election period investments will stop, because everyone is wondering who will be the next president. Based on that, projects will change. In our case, it is easier because we are developing the ports, meaning that wherever the projects may be, they will still require our services. I believe that the Nigerian government should aim for greater consistency. If there is a clearer picture of where the government wants to go, it can only benefit Nigeria at the end of the day.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Since you took over as Comptroller-General, you have worked to reform the agency. What reforms have you carried out and how would you assess their success?<br></h4><p>The Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) has been around for 100 years and has suffered from a negative public perception. It was perceived as corrupt, unwilling to prevent smuggling, and uncommitted to national interest. That is why we needed to reform the agency, and as someone who has risen up the ranks, I felt I needed to take a lead in putting an end to that negative perception. We formulated a six-point agenda and the results have been good so far. First of all, you can't change anybody unless they have an understanding of their role. You have to go back to basics and ask why they are wearing the uniform of a customs officer. You have to understand yourself, who you are, the service you are giving to your nation, and people first and foremost, to be a good customs officer. We have 20,000 customs officers to train, and have already trained 18,690 of them. Once these officers are trained, we expect a force with better morale and better skills in terms of dealing with their respective jobs. And they will have a better idea about how items are valued, and how cargo should be identified and examined. Those are the basics that our officers have to learn. Of course, customs is not just an academic exercise; the key consideration for a customs officer is compliance. Compliance makes our job easier, and when everything runs more smoothly, there is less wasted time and labor and everyone gets on with their jobs more efficiently. Item three was pretty straightforward: to increase our officers' salaries by 100%. You cannot expect officers to change and improve the way they do their jobs, without motivating them to do so financially. But raises are based on performance, and a good performance merits a 100% pay rise. A better salary will undoubtedly reduce corruption in our ranks. Since I took over, our monthly collection figure has increased from NGN30 billion to NGN100 billion. Besides increasing salaries, we have also improved basic services, such as daily transportation for our officers to and from work. We also provide low interest credit for those willing to buy homes, and full accommodation for our officers. Improving perks like that is part of the motivation. We want to improve the standard of living of our officers, so they can pay for their children's future education and live a comfortable life. The fourth aspect of the reforms is ICT. In order to build a solid and sustainable organization you need information technology. Without ICT, you cannot do away with corruption. The only way to do that is by managing the contact between the operators and the custom officers. Everything is now handled electronically, directly, and without interference. That means documents can't be doctored or altered. So all bill of lading documents are now correct, to virtually 100%. We have also granted licenses to private organizations to open Direct Traders Input (DTI) cafes. You lodge your lodgment declaration, which reaches customs online. Hence, all our information is now internet-based. The NCS is a pioneer among custom services in the area of ICT modernization. We have set a record for a trade hub portal, which is unequaled in the world. Some countries have come to us for training in this regard. Item number five on our reform agenda is collaboration with other government agencies. To build a solid planning system, you need the cooperation of other agencies to facilitate trade. The different state institutions and organizations need to be informed of each other's actions. For example, if something has gone through the Food and Drug agency, then we should be informed of that, and vice versa. This will facilitate the import and export of goods and eradicate irregularities, or double billing. The sixth and final item is public relations. You have to keep the public and stakeholders informed of what the reforms being instituted. We have outreach programs, and hold town hall meetings, as well as staging so-called enlightenment programs, and we also engage in the political arena—we take a holistic approach. We have also done presentations overseas in the UK and the Netherlands.</p><h4>What are your priorities going forward?</h4><p>We no longer focus our priorities on curtailing smuggling and increasing customs revenues, but on trade facilitation; that is our priority. We have fast tracked 179 long term and reliable traders.  They get fast declaration and documentation procedures without coming to the Customs Processing Centre (CPC). They can have their cargo taken directly to their warehouse for whatever customs formalities that may be required. This helps to cut costs for both them and us, and also for the consumer, because after all, logistics and customs costs are all eventually reflected in the price of the goods being sold to the public.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The CBN has successfully kept inflation in Nigeria in the single digits in recent years operating within a 6% to 9% band.  What instruments does the CBN have in place to achieve this?<br></h4><p>You are correct that the bank has been able to bring inflation down to single digits over the past couple of months. Before I talk about potential instruments at our disposal, I should highlight that this achievement took a lot of hard work on the part of the bank to make it happen. Especially in light of the enormous amount of money that was injected into the system in the aftermath of the global crisis, by the fiscal, as well as the monetary authorities. Both parties had to do some heavy-lifting to ensure that inflation did not get out of control. With regard to instruments, we will continue to rely on our usual monetary policy instruments like the monetary policy rate (MPR), the Cash Reserve Requirement (CRR), and Open Market Operations (OMO). However, inflation in Nigeria has a structural side. A significant percentage of our imports are in food. Apart from being a drain on our foreign exchange reserves, this also means that we are susceptible to imported inflation. That is why we will also be acting as a financial catalyst to entrepreneurs who may be investing in certain food value chains like rice, sugar, wheat, and fish. Once we can significantly raise the domestic supply of these products, we should see inflation reducing even further.</p><h4>Rates on treasury bills in Nigeria are relatively high compared to other emerging markets, providing no incentive for banks to stop buying these bills.  How will you attempt to reverse this trend?</h4><p>One of the ways to reverse this trend is to develop alternative investment instruments for the banks to invest in and to deepen the market. T-bill rates are high because of demand. If government were successful in building fiscal buffers and stopped borrowing to finance expenditure, rates would decline. Government is revamping tax administration and collection to increase revenue and reduce borrowing. All these efforts will help reverse the high rate of T-bills. On the monetary policy side, we are working to reduce the cost of funds through share-services initiatives that will reduce operating cost for banks, which will ultimately help to reduce the cost of accessing loans by the general public.</p><h4>The CBN utilizes a managed float regime for the Nigerian exchange rate.  What are the benefits of this, and will you adhere to this float regime in the future?</h4><p>The CBN's exchange rate policy is based on the managed float regime that allows a movement of +/- 3% around the midpoint naira/dollar exchange rate of N155/$1. Whenever justifiable, the managed float exchange rate regime allows the bank to intervene when necessary to offset pressures on the exchange rate. These policy stances have served the bank well, since they have properly anchored expectations, created policy certainty in macroeconomic management, while offering a window of flexibility to respond to new information and developments. Over the past couple of years, we have broadly achieved our main objective of keeping the exchange rate stable, notwithstanding the intermittent pressures that have been experienced largely induced by speculative behavior. As the saying goes “if it isn't broken, why fix it?" Therefore, under my leadership, and to the extent that prevailing circumstances support, the managed float regime will continue to guide our exchange rate policy.</p><h4>You have identified two main pillars in your quest to simultaneously reduce the interest rate and maintain the exchange rate: managing factors that create liquidity shocks, and zero tolerance on practices that undermine the health of financial institutions.  What strategies are you putting in place to build these two pillars?</h4><p>First, let me highlight that my goal of achieving a reduction in interest rates is a medium- to long-term goal, the timing of which would be dictated by prevailing macroeconomic developments. Having said this, let me state that one of the reasons that we have high interest rates in Nigeria has to do with the country's infrastructure, including power. Nigerian banks spend a significant amount of their operating cost on providing electricity to their offices. And of course, some of these costs are transferred to customers in the form of high interest rate. Fortunately, the present administration has rightly privatized a major part of that sector, allowing new investments and excellent management skills to flow into it. Given that the industry is still in its nascent stage, the CBN is supporting them with clearing legacy debts and ensuring a smooth take off of the Transitional Electricity Market. We are also facilitating investment in key parts of the value chain by providing funds at concessionary rates to targeted investments in the power sector. We are working to create a new Collateral Registry, in which banks would recognize movable assets like livestock and machinery as collateral for obtaining loans. And as you know, the less risky a loan is, the lower the interest rate should be. With regard to the exchange rate, we have put in place several critical measures to gradually reduce demand for foreign exchange, namely the reform of operational guidelines of BDCs and a reduction in the weekly amount they can buy from us from $50,000 to $15,000. In addition to the reduction (from 3,200 to about 2,800) in the number of BDCs (following recapitalization), we believe that this could save more than $6 billion per year. We have also started outbound money transfer services, which allows customers to simply pay naira to Western Union agents and in return, the recipient gets foreign currency abroad. Although this was launched only months ago, customers have already sent over NGN1.3 billion, or $8.2 million abroad using this service. You can imagine how much foreign exchange this will save the CBN once the other two agents take off and more banks join Western Union.</p><h4>What measures have you put in place to ensure banking sector stability?</h4><p>The CBN takes financial system stability extremely importantly, which is why we are continually striving to sustain the effective management of potential threats and avoid systemic crisis. In fact, my vision in this respect is to effectively manage potential threats to financial stability, and create a strong governance regime conducive to financial intermediation, innovative finance and inclusiveness. Some of the actions we have taken in recent times include a more rigorous risk-based and consolidated supervision, adoption of international best practice within the Basel III framework, introduction of a revised code of corporate governance, extensive human capital development, and pursuing zero tolerance on fraudulent borrowers in the banking system.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As of today, 55% of the population lacks access to a regular electricity supply. How is the electricity privatization process going to benefit Nigerians?<br></h4><p>The capital required to finance the development of the electricity sector is so huge that the government felt obliged to invite significant private sector participation. Indeed, private sector players have been particularly keen to increase generation capacity, in large numbers. We have also seen investors from all over the world seeking to invest in Nigeria. The results have met government expectations, and a much larger capacity to generate, transmit, distribute, and supply electricity throughout the length and breadth of Nigeria is now being installed. Transmission remains the only aspect to be retained by the government for now, and huge sums of money have been set aside to expand transmission infrastructure so that all power generated is distributed to end users. Additionally, the distribution leg has been privatized. Private sector companies know that the best way to increase profits is to ensure that they have more satisfied customers demanding electricity. The fact is that the suppressed demand for electricity in Nigeria today virtually quadruples supply. There will be an expansion of the distribution facilities and infrastructure to reach every corner of Nigeria, whereby all Nigerians will benefit.</p><h4>You have recently signed agreements with General Electric (GE) and the Export-Import Bank of China on power plant projects for small communities. How do you plan to attract more investors to bring in capital and value-added?</h4><p>Nigeria is one of the top four investment destinations in the world, and the number one in Africa. In terms of return on investment (ROI), Nigeria ranks fourth in the world, providing an average ROI of over 35%, having maintained that level over the past couple of years. POWERCHINA has an MoU with the Federal Ministry of Power to fund and provide financing for 20,000 MW at plants in Nigeria, and GE has committed to installing 10,000 MW, while Siemens has committed to a further 10,000 MW. Meanwhile, Daewoo from Korea is another involved party. All these companies are committed to producing 1,000 MW every year for at least the next decade. When you consider the sum total of these initiatives, all things being equal, we will reach our destination.</p><h4>What is the role of renewable energy in rural areas of less developed infrastructure?</h4><p>Nigeria has the desire to diversify its generation mix. For example, 70% of all power stations are gas-fired, while the remaining 30% comes from hydropower. If you were to realize production exclusively using gas, then you could not call yourself an energy-secure country. Therefore, we are compelled by necessity to seek alternatives, with renewable energy being just such an alternative. Be it solar, wind, or biomass, we are working to incorporate this technology into the network. In fact, for rural areas, the President has personally flagged off what we termed “Operation Light Up Rural Nigeria," where we are using 100% solar sources to power entire communities. We are also set to add wind to the mix and are working on biomass solutions, although these are more geared toward the major cities where a mix of waste elements is available. Then, of course, we are working on small-scale hydro projects. Work has been completed on a national renewable energy and energy efficiency policy, which should see imminent approval by the Federal Executive Council. Meanwhile, solar installations are increasingly cheaper due to technological advances. In rural areas that are not connected to the national grid, and that lack gas pipelines to fire turbines, or lack sufficient wind velocity, we can make particular use of solar power. Nigeria sits on substantial coal deposits, and we are also looking to this fuel as an energy source, although clearly it is not a part of the renewable landscape. In fact, we have signed agreements with companies that are interested in developing coal-fired power plants. The idea is to ensure that in the future 10% of our energy needs derive from coal, at least 5% from solar and wind, perhaps 15% from hydro, and the remainder from gas, as Nigeria currently boasts the eighth largest gas deposits in the world.</p><h4>From a regulatory standpoint, will a specific policy or law be required to incentivize further deals?</h4><p>The government has introduced a policy framework that makes Nigeria an investors' haven. Within the power sector, the Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading (NBET) company was set up for one primary purpose: to buy power from all the independent power producers (IPPs) that may not feel comfortable about direct sales to distribution companies or to the Transmission Company of Nigeria out of concerns of non-payment. However, the NBET will buy this power from the IPPs on behalf of the transmission and distribution companies. Therefore, investors now know that regardless of the amount of power you produce, once you have a power purchase agreement from the NBET, you can't lose your investment. The tariffs have been adjusted and solid profitability is built in without making electricity excessively pricey for consumers and customers. In addition to the NBET being capitalized, there is also a partial World Bank risk guarantee to support the NBET in the event of its default. Even the African Development Bank is working on the same measure, in terms of a partial risk guarantee for the NBET, which confirms that incentives are in place.</p><h4>What are you doing to assure the population that there is a plan at work regarding energy provision?</h4><p>The Transformation Agenda arose at a particularly low point for Nigeria. A key goal of the program, therefore, is ensuring that a larger proportion of the population benefits from electricity supply, and not just in quantitative, but also qualitative terms. Part of the accountability of government involves taking each citizen into consideration and ensuring that resources meant for the entire country are spread equitably. That is what the President is now doing, and this will ultimately lead to the success of “Operation Light Up Rural Nigeria." Meanwhile, we are stemming corruption by benchmarking procurements, service delivery, and project execution to global best practices. We are accountable to the country, and the people know it. The Transformation Agenda is working, and more people are getting a regular power supply, with improvements continuously being registered. Our firm hope is that the success of the Transformation Agenda in the power sector can serve as a catalyst for the industrial sector, as without power, industries cannot thrive and develop.</p><p>Nigeria's power sector has a very bright future. For the first time, the government is focusing on power as a priority. It is now addressing the entire sector from a holistic perspective and working toward the future instead of reacting to a decaying infrastructure. A glance at the country's demographics reveals that industries can begin to thrive on the back of a market hungry to consume, which is all underpinned by the power sector. As we mature and make more power available to our people, we believe that the economy will not be talking 6.5%, but double-digit GDP growth, which we keenly look forward to.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You recently acquired the majority stake in AMNI. Can you please explain the reasons behind this decision?<br></h4><p>The majority of the shareholders who divested/sold their shares are well advanced in age, and have little appetite for risk. The oil and gas business is quite a risky one, and companies who do not invest in their growth will not only stagnate but eventually die. Therefore, the decision to bring on board those who will take these risky business decisions was not a difficult one to make.</p><h4>Many of the larger IOCs are currently retreating from the country and selling their assets in the Niger delta region. Does the company have any interest in acquiring new oil fields in the area?</h4><p>We participated in Shell OMLs 71 &amp; 72 tender, which we did not win. There are other IOC assets we are looking at. This process is more like reserve-based lending, and fortunately, we have some ongoing production, and are, therefore, able to leverage this to raise equity. The local banks are aggressive in terms of supporting successful indigenous companies, and the majority of companies to have won these blocks are indigenous. As indigenous players, we bring a different perspective to operating in these environments than the IOCs' current mode of doing business. There are opportunities for people who know the terrain to make a significant impact.</p><h4>As the current President of the Nigerian Association of Indigenous Petroleum Explorers and Producers (NAIPEC), what advice would you give to a company interested in the industry?</h4><p>The most important thing to know is the imperatives of oil and gas business. Some people know the downstream business well and believe it is just as easy to operate at the upstream end. However, investing $50 million in downstream operations is quite substantial with manageable risks. $50 million in the upstream sphere will drill only one well, which could easily transpire to be dry.</p><h4>Diezani Alison-Madueke, the current Minister of Petroleum Resources, foresees an oil and gas industry where 60% of all companies here will be indigenous by 2015. What is your opinion of this?</h4><p>By the grace of god, everything is possible. Nigerian production is at 2.4 million bbpd. Indigenous companies are struggling to produce 10% of this. By 2015, we should be able to achieve 15% market share. By 2020, perhaps we can reach 60%. The IOCs are the ones with the necessary funds for deep water production. There are a further 20 billion or 30 billion barrels of oil in deep water. I do not foresee much competition between IOCs and the indigenous players for deepwater play. The IOCs are leaving more difficult terrain, onshore production, and operating where they have better control and more experience in deep water production.</p><h4>As a geologist by training with over 40 years of experience in the field, where do you see the next opportunities in Nigeria's offshore sector?</h4><p>IOCs are going to keep moving further and further offshore and continue to divest their assets onshore, or in shallow water. The opportunities in Nigeria lie in gas. I think we should be able to capture the opportunities within the West African region before looking elsewhere. I also believe that it is easy to succeed if you are not overly ambitious and do not have people siphoning your resources elsewhere.</p><h4>From a regulatory standpoint, which improvements would you like to see for indigenous companies?</h4><p>The new PIB is taking care of the complaints we have had regarding the fiscal terms under which we operate and opportunities to compete for assets that have been divested by the IOCs. It is difficult for indigenous companies to operate on the same fiscal terms as the IOCs, which are operating large reserves compared to those of indigenous counterparts, which underlines the need for a more favorable fiscal regime.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What makes the new national automotive policy unique?<br></h4><p>The policy is comprehensive and was designed to complement the circumstances of various stakeholders. Currently, we are importing over 90% of the vehicles we drive. Automobiles and spare parts, including tires, are the second biggest consumer of foreign exchange. And as the economy improves and demand grows, it will soon occupy the number one user of foreign exchange. Part of the policy relates to looking at how to develop the internal market with affordable vehicles and a financing scheme. VON Nigeria Ltd will be assembling low-cost Hyundai vehicles that will compete with imported used vehicles. We will also be developing an affordable vehicle-financing scheme. Over 90% of automobiles are sold on a cash basis here, as vehicle financing through the banks is done at an interest rate of 22% per annum, which is not affordable for many purchasers. This is why we are working with some banks and other agencies to see if we can obtain affordable financing at the single-digit level, of perhaps 9%. That should make vehicles more affordable and boost the market. We estimate the demand for vehicles doubling to about 700,000 units annually with the introduction of an affordable vehicle scheme. You can see that the potential demand in the market is huge. Additionally, there is the issue of patronage. All government agencies and ministries are mandated to prioritize products from local assembly plants, except when the variety required is not produced locally. We are also planning to build automotive supply parks with all necessary facilities; a road network, power, water, and other infrastructure, so that companies can become established quickly. We are addressing standards by outlining automotive safety standards and are building an automotive test center to ensure the safety factor. Finally, we have programs for manpower development. These include creating a curriculum for training mechanics in modern automotive technology, and setting a syllabus for teaching automotive engineering at Nigerian universities. We will collaborate with the Industrial Training Fund as well to set up automotive production/training centers.<br></p><h4>How is the National Automotive Council (NAC) helping to attract investment in the sector?</h4><p>The policy is designed specifically to attract investment into the sector. Since the policy was announced, over 10 major OEMs from Europe and Asia have expressed interest in investing in Nigeria and have signed technical partnerships with Nigerian companies either to use the existing assembly plants or establish new ones. We are working with the Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission (NIPC) to attract component manufacturers that will supply the assembly plants. Vehicle assembly started in Nigeria in the 1960s with a number of companies using semi-knocked-down (SKD) kits. The government became involved when it established six assembly plants in the 1970s using completely-knocked-down (CKD) kits. These were producing over 100,000 vehicles annually by the 1980s, with local content programs vigorously pursued. However, our financial crises, which started from 1985, led to a drastic reduction in demand for new vehicles and the beginning of the shift of demand to the second-hand market. This, coupled with the lack of government patronage and the lowering of vehicle import tariffs in 2005, led to the collapse of the industry. While demand for new vehicles recovered from 2000 onwards, the local industry was not in a position to compete. This new policy took account of that failure to ensure it was not repeated.</p><h4>Do you foresee a resurgence in tire manufacturing due to changes in the automotive policy?</h4><p>We are a tropical country, and have had rubber plantations since colonial times. Michelin and Dunlop started producing tires in Nigeria in 1962 and 1963, respectively. They were meeting about 80% of our needs, of about 3 million tires annually by 2005, and even had plans to expand to meet market demand. In 2005, we lowered the tariffs from a 40% import duty to 10% for truck tires and 20% for car tires. This caused the factories to close down because they could not compete with Indian and Chinese tire manufacturers. They are now exporting the rubber from their plantations and importing finished tires. We are currently spending about $1 billion on importing about 5 million tires annually. The new policy has a special provision to encourage tire manufacturing in Nigeria.</p><h4>How does the policy address the issue of dealerships?</h4><p>We have two types of automotive dealers at the moment: dealers that trade with representatives of major OEMs and dealers that depend wholly on the sale of imported second-hand vehicles. The policy is geared toward producing affordable vehicles and, when coupled with an affordable vehicle-financing scheme, will reduce the demand for used vehicles. There are also tariff measures in the policy to reduce the demand for used vehicles. The dealers of second-hand vehicles would be assisted to become distributors for the assembly plants. The credit purchase scheme we are establishing would be through the dealers. There would still be a second-hand vehicle market, but it would be fed locally, and not with imports. This policy does raise the bar against imports, which tends to encourage smuggling. However, there is a provision in this policy to put in place a tight program to prevent smuggling that involves a new cross check mechanism and national database for vehicle identification numbers.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How can indigenous participation in the oil and gas industry be increased?<br></h4><p>This is actually already happening. In the past, the extent of participation was limited, yet upon the implementation of the Local Content Act, more Nigerians have become participants. We now have many new areas of focus, and can measure the number of Nigerians working in the oil and gas industry. We can measure the number of man hours of engineering completed in Nigeria and the number of vessels maintained. More Nigerians are playing critical roles in the leadership of the industry. For example, all the major operating companies have a senior hierarchy of Nigerians, and many service companies have Nigerian CEOs. The expatriate management system is such that Nigerians have a say in who comes to work here. The board has to certify that we don't have a Nigerian suitable for a job before an expatriate can occupy that position. The number of loans that Nigerian banks are issuing is also growing. In short, we are confident of increasing the level of indigenous participation. Now, we have to get back to grassroots. Our focus is to translate what is being done by Nigerian companies to more directly and positively impact the Nigerian people.</p><h4>In which way have you partnered with other governmental bodies to extend the benefits of the oil and gas industries to other sectors of the economy?</h4><p>We want to create more synergy in what we are doing. We also want to reach out to other sectors of the economy and show them the progress that we have made by relying on the Nigerian local content policy. This works in two ways. First, they can benefit by applying the same principles to their own activities. Secondly, the oil and gas industry drives a large market. We are trying to convince other agencies that we can implement this same model to achieve economies of scale and gradually reduce price. Regarding funding, we believe that the Bank of Industry is experienced in supporting entrepreneurial activity, and we want to work with it to use our funds and its own to support SMEs that manufacture. Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are now required to manufacture certain components in Nigeria. Among the challenges will be how to fund these new ventures. It is important to give these new players adequate financial support. We want SMEs to show their potential to OEMs, which can subsequently create companies that supply SMEs with components produced in Nigeria. Meanwhile, the Presidential Task Force on Power is the driving force behind cooperation between government agencies and the private sector in the power sector.</p><h4>Many indigenous companies are pursuing the same contracts. How do you see everyone getting a slice of the cake in the future?</h4><p>Ultimately, we are talking about competition. Not everyone is going to get a slice of the cake, and that was part of my message in the beginning. Some companies will have to start doing other things. Before, everyone wanted to do business in pipes. If Shell wanted pipes, 50 companies would try to supply them; however, only one or two would actually succeed. We are trying to place an emphasis on manufacturing. We have four pipe mills in Nigeria. Shell would use a procurement system to buy pipes from four companies using specifications. Were we to do that in many locations, it would reduce the amount of people who are looking to supply services such as welding, roads, or equipment. Instead of having 50 contractors, there will be four supplying through their vendors. The other suppliers will be supplying these manufacturers, whereby a supply chain is built. The industry will be streamlined once we get companies that have assets and certain knowledge in the industry. And as we start moving along the trajectory, we are going to start seeing Nigerian companies that boast assets, knowledge, and specialization. Every participant in the industry must hold a Nigerian local content certificate. What we want to do for job creation is to expand the shop floors in Nigeria, where people can work 24/7 to supply products to the common market. The moment we create platforms on which people can innovate, we will be able to move away from a system in which everyone is pursuing the same contracts.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[sure-thing]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Given that SURE-P was created to intervene, what is the mandate of your committee?<br></h4><p>The committee's overarching mandate is to mitigate the immediate impact of the petroleum subsidy discontinuation on the population, particularly for the poor and vulnerable; by laying a foundation for the successful development of a national safety net program targeting the poor on a continuous basis. It also aims to accelerate economic transformation through investment in critical infrastructure projects, so as to drive economic growth towards achieving the nation's vision 20:2020. The Committee's aim is to deliver all these with integrity and thus restore Nigerians' confidence in its government. From the aforementioned, SURE-P's interventions fall within 2 major areas; a social safety net programs and then infrastructural development program.</p><h4>How does SURE-P work?</h4><p>The SURE-P programs are executed through Program Implementation Units (PIUs) that have overall responsibility for day-to-day management of funded programs and projects. PIUs are created within federal government's Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) under whose sector a program is being funded. SURE-P, through the PIUs, provides oversight and supervision of the projects, ensuring that the highest standards are achieved on the projects and that contractors are paid on completion of the projects without bureaucratic bottlenecks. The Director General, Budget Office of the Federation (BOF) is the designated accounting officer for SURE-P and payments are made directly to contractors by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).</p><h4>Are there any other projects in the social safety nets?</h4><p>There is a Mass Transit program, which provides affordable transportation and accessible means of transportation for the populace. SURE-P also has the Technical Vocational Educational Training (TVET), which is designed to facilitate wealth creation and job generation through investment in technical vocational training for unskilled young Nigerians, as well as improving the training facilities required for delivering such training. Additionally, the Graduate Internship Scheme (GIS) provides Nigerian graduates with quality temporary work that will make them stronger candidates for job openings in the labor market through a one-year internship placement. In terms of employment, we have the Community Service, Women and Youth Employment (CSWYE) designed to encourage youth employment; the Community Services Scheme (CSS) which seeks to alleviate poverty through employment and empowerment opportunities for women, youths and people with disabilities; the Federal Road Maintenance Agency (FERMA) project has an added objective of helping young people remain in their communities without necessarily having to move to urban centers in search of jobs. These schemes have a three-pronged purpose of alleviating poverty, providing employment and empowerment while training and providing a skilled work force at every level for companies that may wish to invest in Nigeria.</p><h4>How about the infrastructural development aspect?</h4><p>The infrastructural development program has been designed with the aim of closing the country's infrastructural deficit and setting it on the course for providing a proficient investment environment. To this end, SURE-P has prioritized Roads, Bridges and Railways as the targets for its intervention. On our Roads and Bridges programs, we have achieved near completion on the East-West and Lokoja-Abuja Roads, as well as other major roads across the six geo-political zones of Nigeria. The Roads and Bridges Program aims to complete four ongoing core road projects and to construct two new river-crossing bridges across the geopolitical zones of Nigeria. The roads cover a total distance of 1,326km. In addition to the aforementioned, our FERMA Public Works program not only creates mass employment opportunities through the implementation of a National Road Maintenance Public Works Program; it also aims to achieve zero potholes on major Federal Roads. Perhaps the most critical and audacious infrastructural intervention is the SURE Railways program. This can be seen within the context of the government's commitment to improve and rehabilitate our 113-year-old railway system, which had hitherto been overlooked by previous administrations. To this end, we have restored the Lagos to Kano Narrow Gauge line, strengthened existing bridges from the Southern-most port to the lines furthest North, and are currently working on the lines in between.</p><h4>What in your opinion makes SURE-P stand out from other government developmental initiatives?</h4><p>It has as part of its committee members, relevant ministers and state officials that would ensure success. SURE-P has as members the Ministers of Finance and Petroleum who ensure that information on funding are available on time to ensure effective planning of projects while the membership of the Ministers of National Planning and Minister of State for Health ensures that projects tie up with the national plan and developmental goals.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What would you say are your core business services?<br></h4><p>Courteville Business Solutions (CBS) offers services aimed at improving process efficiencies for the private and public sectors. This provides us with opportunities to look at gaps and overlaps in how things are done. We can then decide whether to apply a system to walk a firm through the development of a web or application processing system. We choose to go with mobile web or application services to help companies deliver their products and services to the satisfaction of all stakeholders. AutoReg is our flagship tool, while the other new one is Egole Shopping, an online shopping site that I am proud to say is the only profitable e-commerce site in the whole of West Africa. There are over 250 merchants on Egole Shopping that have been provided with virtual office suites and shops through which they can sell their goods. That is what we do. We help buyers get onto the site, and help companies to sell their products. However, you cannot always successfully copy and paste a model that apparently works well in the West into the Nigerian Market. You have to take culture into consideration, which is what we have done with Egole, a shopping platform that allows over 10,000 users, on a daily basis, to visit the site and browse for goods.</p><h4>What tools does Courteville offer to different industries?</h4><p>We have a relationship with the Nigerian Insurance Association, whereby we designed, developed, and manage the entire database management system for insurance policy issuance on motor vehicles across the whole of Nigeria on behalf of the Association. And now, we are in the process of adding marine insurance policy documentation to that. Thanks to practices like this, every single motor vehicle in Nigeria is now authentically insured. I would hope to see a model like this not only implemented by Courteville, but also by the insurance industry as a whole. It would contribute greatly to the way the general tariff is structured in Nigeria. It would also help insurance companies in confirming when the customer signs a policy with them. It allows the regulators of the industry to get a clearer sense of the kind of business that is happening in the industry, and this has been a major issue in the past. We also work with the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) by providing a system that has allowed it to reduce the processing period for the approval of certification processes of all manufactured products or imported/exported goods from what used to be, say nine months to a year, down to a week.</p><h4>What are the benefits of working on projects such as this in Nigeria?</h4><p>We realized that there is a huge gap between the supply of education and demand in the country and across Africa. While demand is huge, the number of institutions is insufficient to accommodate it. We also realized that the direction of the curriculum is focused on academic sciences. We want to educate using our RELAY online educational platform, which was created in collaboration with Ravensbourne University in the UK. We are starting in five main areas: fashion pattern cutting, fashion promotion, website design and content management, interior design, and film editing and post-production. We are able to achieve the same kind of quality in online education, but cheaper at around £200 for one module. This is the first of its kind anywhere in this part of the world. Everything about our model is locally designed and implemented in Nigeria; we design solutions to match and to identify with what is necessary to specifically overcome Nigeria's challenges.  We believe that over the next five years, and through our medium-term strategy and service provision, our next focus cuts across West Africa, Europe, and the Caribbean. As an ISO-certified company, we have been able to deliver services matching international standards. We employ about 200 staff, but indirectly employ about 10,000 people across Nigeria.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Ecobank has secured a spot in UK Export Finance's project to finance a £3 billion Direct Lending Facility to UK Exporters. What is the significance of this achievement for Ecobank's activities?<br></h4><p>Ecobank was appointed alongside 19 international banks as partner banks to UKEF, and is its sole local partner in Nigeria. The objective of the partnership is to help facilitate the direct facility, which UKEF recently established for the purpose of providing loan facilities to borrowers beyond the UK in order to finance payments due in respect of goods and services supplied by persons with business inside and outside the UK. The appointment of Ecobank as the sole Nigerian partner bank will, therefore, enable and facilitate trade between the UK and Nigeria through the UKEF in Nigeria. Earlier in 2014, we signed a $20 million line of credit for importers with the Brazilian Development Bank as a result of the significant interest of Brazilian companies in the construction and oil and gas industries in Nigeria. The line of credit will provide special funding needs to customers as well as prospective customers importing goods into Nigeria from Brazil. In addition, an Export Credit Agency financing facility that gives Ecobank Nigeria access to a line of credit of up to $200 million from various ECAs in Western Europe was also recently signed. Indeed trade facilitation between countries is really one of the core components of our activities with the objective of realizing our vision of contributing to the economic development of Africa.</p><h4>You recently signed a $150-million term loan facility, marking Ecobank Nigeria's entry to the international loan market. What are your thoughts on this?</h4><p>Demand is coming from local investors buying into the asset diversification of the government, particularly in the energy sector. Shell and Chevron have mostly been selling their onshore fields to local investors. The banks provided the debt portion of the funding, because the cash flows of these oil blocks have been proven. It is just a matter of how quickly they can raise production and they can average out the term of the loan. We see an average maturity of three to five years for the loan and the initial loan is seven years in duration. Those assets programs drove the liability strategy of going to the loans market and to the European market to get more stable funds.</p><h4>Could you shed some light on how your asset base and earnings have increased in 2014?</h4><p>The bank's total asset base has continued to grow steadily over the years following the successful merger with legacy Oceanic Bank in December 2011. Total assets pre-merger were at NGN443.9 billion ($2.9 billion) in 2010, and this has since grown to NGN1,325.3 billion ($8.4 billion) in 2012, NGN1,460.8 billion ($9.1 billion) by 2013, and stands at NGN1,555.6 billion ($9.6 billion) as of 3Q2014. This growth has been due to an increase in business across all segments. Leveraging our robust risk management framework, the bank has cautiously grown its risk asset portfolio by over 200%, from a pre-merger position in 2010 of NGN225.3 billion ($1.49 billion) to a year-end 2013 position of NGN625.9 billion ($3.9 billion). The bank's gross earnings have also improved significantly, growing by over 200% from NGN58.3 billion ($400 million) in 2010 to NGN 176.7 billion ($1.1 billion) at the end of 2013. Leveraging on its almost 500 retail outlets, the bank has continued to deliver value to over 7 million customers nationwide.</p><h4>Could you tell us about the competitive advantage that Ecobank has over other banks operating in Nigeria?</h4><p>We define our customers by two broad categories: a portfolio of regional customers, and a portfolio of domestic (local) customers. To our regional customers, we offer platforms that  allow them to transact across the various geographies we are present in. We offer a good regional solution for all these problems, which is different from how we handle local customers. As a regional player in the African market, we hold the number one position. The regional market provides almost 20% of our revenue. To our domestic bank customers, the banking business is all about service. We have a good brand name and high level of integrity and we continue to improve on our technology platform to effectively compete domestically. We have one of the largest branch networks in Nigeria providing services to all segments of the domestic market. We are currently sixth in terms of total assets with the clear objective of being third in the shortest possible time.</p><h4>A large share of the Nigerian population remains unbanked. How are you trying to promote financial inclusion?</h4><p>Our acquisition of Oceanic Bank included their microfinance business of 1.1 million customers and $150 million of assets in deposits and just $12 million of loans. The microfinance business is geared toward financial inclusion. In line with the Central Bank of Nigeria's (CBN's) Financial Inclusion initiative, Ecobank has introduced a number of novel products aimed at providing Nigerians with direct access to basic financial services. Such initiatives include free access to the bank's mobile banking platform, and the setting up of mobile money agents to facilitate the transfer and receipt of money across the country, regardless of location. We are committed to being a strong player in ensuring the achievement of high levels of financial inclusion within Nigeria. We have set up over 1,500 ATMs, and over 13,000 POS at locations across Nigeria, with around 500 branches.</p><h4>What is your growth strategy for the next five years?</h4><p>We aspire to be one of the top three banks in terms of asset base, which will translate to one of the top in terms of profitability. With our growth rate we believe that this is achievable within the next five years. We have identified infrastructure development, agriculture, and oil and gas as the sectors that will open up as areas of strong growth. Given our pan-African role, we attract international companies investing in various areas of development coming into Nigeria as partners. Our continuous technological innovation enables us to compete and provide excellent banking services, which would endear more customers to the bank. We  are well positioned to continue to attracting new international, as well as local, customers.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>With over 6,000 km of flow lines and pipelines and about 700 producing wells, the Shell Group is the pioneer and leader of the petroleum industry in Nigeria. How do you see Nigeria's production capability changing in the future?<br></h4><p>Nigeria is truly blessed with tremendous resources. There are not that many countries around the world with an oil and gas resource base that is as impressive as that of Nigeria. Hence the foremost challenge for Nigeria is not really technical in my view. It is mostly about having a conducive business and operating environment. There are, and there always will be, opportunities here. What the industry and the regulators need to do is to unlock these opportunities. Nigeria is a challenging place to operate, but it certainly has a resource base that allows some optimism for the future.</p><h4>What opportunities and challenges are there specifically?</h4><p>Nigeria is an expensive place to do business because of the security issues we face. Operating in the Niger Delta, both onshore and offshore, requires special precautions and measures that incur considerable expense. Because of that, the costs are higher compared to other places around the world. Another challenge is fiscal stability. What investors need is a sense of certainty. This is a business where investments do not generally provide a return within 12-18 months. Very often, it takes up to 10 or even up to 20 years, meaning investors need predictability in terms of the fiscal environment. Broadly speaking, I would say the economic environment we operate within is crucial in terms of having the confidence to continue to invest. If Nigeria can provide that, there is a considerable opportunity to be had.</p><h4>What is the strategic importance and potential of liquefied natural gas (LNG) resources for the Shell Group and Nigeria as a whole?</h4><p>The importance is considerable. Nigeria LNG is one of the largest single LNG plants in the world. It is important for its shareholders, which include Shell, Total, ENI, and the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), which is actually the largest single shareholder in the venture. Today, the facility accounts for 8% of the global LNG market, which is truly significant. Of course, the rest of the world is growing rapidly in terms of LNG capacity, an example being Mozambique, but elsewhere, too. The world is looking for gas, which is a clean source of energy relative to certain alternatives, and tremendous growth is projected as a result. There are currently six trains in operation at Nigerian LNG, with the potential to work on train seven. This could be a significant expansion as trains built today are larger than those built 10 or 15 years ago, meaning that Nigeria LNG may move from 22 million tons per annum to around 30 million tons given sound investment conditions.</p><h4>Despite the oil in Nigeria being of the highest quality and relatively easy to drill, many among the largest IOCs are currently retreating from the region and selling their Niger Delta oil fields. How can you explain this trend?</h4><p>I can only speak for Shell companies in Nigeria, and for us it is part of normal portfolio rationalization. What we are doing in Nigeria with some of the oil blocks that we have put up for sale is simply a consequence of having looked at our portfolio and made a decision that this is an area where other companies can also play. Some can perhaps add more value to it than we can. As with any other business, when that becomes the case, divestment becomes a consideration. It is not a question of a retreat. If you look at how much money the Shell Group is investing in Nigeria yearly, it is still extremely high. We have large projects like Gbaran-Ubie Phase II going ahead. We are looking to push forward on the deepwater projects of tremendous potential. We have a number of exciting deepwater projects, as well as some promising shallow-water schemes that we may develop if conditions are right. As I have already said, there are tremendous opportunities in Nigeria. We are concentrating on those areas we believe we can add the most value in.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[using-your-noodle]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Present in Nigeria since 1996, Indomie currently holds more than a 70% market share. What challenges have you overcome during this time?<br></h4><p>We introduced Indomie to Nigeria in 1988, before we started manufacturing it as a joint venture between the Tolaram Group and Salim Group in the year 1996. The first challenge for us was that noodles were unknown to Nigeria prior to our arrival. There was another multinational player, who exited the noodle business in 2000 leaving us as the sole player until 2006. For the first few years, we did not turn a profit as we effectively had to create the market for noodles from scratch. We invested heavily in grass root activities focussed on increasing trials. By 2008 there were another three or four players and today there are 17 in total making the industry highly competitive. Today, there is a whole industry around the noodle business that employs over 20,000 people directly. We are proud to have created this industry, and moreover, it is not limited to noodles. Local flourmills, palm oil refineries, seasoning, packaging, carton factories and others have also benefited. We are fully backward integrated, with 90% to 95% of our raw materials being locally sourced.</p><h4>Would you look to receive any government support or incentives?</h4><p>We would like to move into the agriculture sector and are in talks with numerous state authorities to acquire some land parcels. That is one area where we would look to receive incentives. Agriculture is the future and should be subject to long-term investment. Hence, we would like the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to make convenient loan facilities available, which would generate substantial employment in the agricultural sector. We are also talking to various agencies and are looking into whether Development Finance Institutions can help, although the first step is to obtain land.</p><h4>How Nigerian do you consider the company to be?</h4><p>We are a 100% Nigerian public limited company, and a home-grown brand. Nigeria is our base, but our market is West Africa, and we are also considering south and east Africa. We should ultimately be present in 15 African markets. We have developed our own flourmills, palm oil refineries, and packaging plants, as well as a seasoning plant, making for a total of 10 facilities today. And so, from our raw materials to our employees to our trade partners and most importantly our consumers, we are a Nigerian company.</p><h4>Are you looking to bring special products into the market, or will the company remain focused on the noodle segment?</h4><p>Noodles are the key driver of our business but we have also launched “Power Oil" brand of refined vegetable oil and “Power Pasta"  brand of spaghetti. We are providing oil in 140 ml sachets, and 750 ml and 3.0 liter bottles, with the aim of replacing unhealthy, unbranded oil consumption. In 2014 we entered into the ready-to-eat snacks category with the launch of  “Minimie Chinchin," and there are more to come.</p><h4>Where do you see the next opportunity for a private investor interested in the FMCG goods segment?</h4><p>We pioneered noodles and made it a success story; I believe that in the food category, a company with a unique, affordable, and tasty product can do the same, but they will require patience to build it up over the years. The supply chain and distribution components are two of the main challenges to be taken into account. Access to sales channels is not as in developed markets; it is difficult to reach the consumer. We would first look to becoming the largest FMCG player in Nigeria in the food sector, before expanding geographically and becoming a Pan-African player.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>With the National Broadband Plan, the federal government aims to increase broadband penetration to 30% by 2018. How do you assess the progress to date?<br></h4><p>Since implementation of the National Broadband Plan, Nigeria's broadband penetration has grown from 5.46% in 2011 to 8% in 2014. It is with this in mind that we will continue to drive our National Broadband Strategy that seeks to increase broadband penetration from 8% to 30% by 2018. This will be made possible by extending our 3G/LTE Wireless Broadband Coverage to 80% of the population, expanding fixed broadband to 16% of the population based on fiber by 2018, with minimum download speeds of 1.5 Mbps. The licensing of infrastructure companies (InFraCos) is on-going. InFraCos will provide efficient wholesale bandwidth services on a non-discriminatory, open-access, and price-regulated basis as well as provide metropolitan fiber and transmission services across Nigeria.</p><p>There is a lot of progress being made on the broadband initiative right now, as reflected by larger broadband penetration and lower costs of broadband subscription, which have fallen from NGN93,000 ($520) in 2011 to NGN55,000 ($308) in 2014. We now have 4G across the major cities of Nigeria.</p><p>If we continue at this pace in terms of infrastructure, we should see 100% mobile penetration and broadband penetration will hit 50% by 2020. More Nigerians will have access to better download speeds of over 1.5Mbps. But the key thing is to get all the obstacles for investment out of the way and encourage investment in the broadband infrastructure in this country—that is what we are doing. We have identified several bottlenecks that impede roll-out of needed infrastructure as well as ubiquitous access and quality service delivery across the country. These bottlenecks include multiple taxations, right of way (RoW), high charges, multiple taxations, vandalization of critical infrastructure, and destruction of telecoms equipment including tampering with base stations critical for facilitating access to telecoms services. We conducted research some time back that revealed that RoW charges, levies, and taxes imposed on telecoms operators contributed to about 70% of the cost of rolling out infrastructure in several states.</p><p>To address these issues, the Ministry has initiated and is promoting the Smart States initiative. The aim of the Smart States initiative is to ensure that effective measures are adopted to remove arbitrary charges and eradicate multiple taxations across the nation. The initiative is geared at engaging governors and relevant authorities at the state and federal level to address the bottlenecks impeding the development of critical infrastructure roll out across Nigeria.  Through the initiative, the Ministry is helping to ensure that effective measures are adopted that would significantly reduce Right of Way (ROW) fees, standardize state levies and taxes on ICT infrastructure, and consolidate licensing through the “Dig Once, Pay Once" philosophy.</p><p>Bayelsa, Cross River, FCT, Lagos, and Ondo States have signed memoranda of understanding (MoUs) that will eradicate multiple taxes and are now “Smart States." Anambra, Delta, Gombe, and Osun States have agreed to cooperate with government to become “Smart States." Lagos has been an exemplar with the reduction of RoW charges by 85%. This move reduced RoW charges in Lagos from NGN3,000 ($17) per meter to NGN500 ($2.80).  We have also estimated that for Nigeria's data revolution to take off, at least $25 billion is needed over the next five to ten years.</p><h4>Promoting local content in the ICT sector is a key focus of the Federal Ministry of Communication Technology. How is the Ministry promoting indigenous participation in the ICT sector?</h4><p>The ICT sector has plenty of potential to create jobs and wealth as well as contribute significantly to the growth of the Nigerian economy. Improved indigenous participation in this increasingly strategic industry is a key part of our achieving this potential. We are tackling the current poor participation of locally-based firms in the ICT industry through a raft of recommendations contained in a major policy instrument called “Guidelines for Nigerian Content Development in the ICT Industry," released in December 2013. Specific intentions for the Guidelines include: providing temporary measures to encourage growth of the local ICT industry; improving standards and quality assurances on offer from the local ICT industry; encouraging a more balanced share of the market between domestic and international brands; increasing the availability and  reducing the cost of devices required to create a knowledge-based interconnected economy that leverages the internet; and improving security and control of government data. The guidelines were developed after several separate and sub-sector specific stakeholder engagements and will be periodically reviewed in consultation with industry stakeholders. The review period and input will be guided in part by changes in global trends and practices in ICT and Nigeria's developmental aspirations. A newly created Office of Nigerian Content in ICT (ONC), headed by a National Coordinator, will affect the implementation of the guidelines. In addition to this significant policy initiative, the government has committed $9 million in seed capital to a first-ever Nigerian ICT venture-capital (VC) fund. The first round of the fund recently closed at $16.2 million and the fund will be managed by Silicon Valley industry veteran Echo VC. The intention is to provide a small part of the very scarce risk capital that our technology entrepreneurs are currently having such difficulty in finding as well as to help give the VC funding industry in Nigeria a badly needed kick-start.  Further rounds will aim to reach a target of $50 million, and it is anticipated that via a knock-on effect, the fund will create up to 35,000 jobs.</p><h4>Could you shed light on the opportunities that exist for foreign investors to invest in Nigeria's ICT sector and the way in which the Federal Ministry of Communication Technology is providing an enabling environment for this?</h4><p>Connect Nigeria is one plan to develop a ubiquitous, robust, and cost-effective ICT infrastructure as well as ensure that Nigerians have affordable and reliable access to ICT devices and have the capacity to use them. In terms of local content, we aim to lower the barriers to entry, increase the participation of Nigerian companies in the ICT sector, and stimulate job creation in the industry. Regarding ICT in government, we seek to increase the adoption of ICTs by government to achieve greater transparency, efficiency, and productivity in governance and citizen engagement.</p><p>Complementing the above initiatives, we have also instituted practical policy guidelines rolled out after due consultation with key industry stakeholders, establishing and maintaining a suitably enabling environment that seeks to ensure our current impressive growth rates are sustained.</p><p>The National ICT policy (2012), crafted from the many disparate policies and guidelines that existed prior to this Ministry's establishment, is a prime example. Our Broadband Plan was created by a Presidential Committee, made up of industry professionals, and its rollout is being managed by a similarly constituted Broadband Council. Regarding the development of Nigerian content, we have an advisory council pulled from the private sector, and periodic reviews are built into its design to reflect current thinking in the ICT industry as long as they continue to benefit the local industry.</p><p>Our guidelines in Nigerian content also seek to ensure additional value is created locally and that the valuable partnerships we have with multi-national ICT corporations are more collaborative, growth-oriented partnerships. This will help us create more growth areas in local ICT hardware assembly, telecoms infrastructure, data-storage centers, software development and human-capacity development.</p><h4>The federal government has aimed to become one of the twenty biggest economies in the world by 2020. To what extent can Nigeria's ICT sector serve as a catalyst for the achievement of the Vision 20:2020?</h4><p>It is a sector that is gaining more and more prominence over time. It is important because ICT companies now contribute about 10% to Nigeria's GDP. Contribution to GDP has increased in four years from 5.46% since the Ministry's creation in 2011 to 9.58% in Q3 2014. This marks 24% annual growth, making it the 4th fastest growing sector in the economy. There is no sign of this growth abating, especially in light of new policies and programs of the Ministry of Communication Technology. Even more than that, it is a strategic area because in addition to what the ICT sector on its own contributes, the ICT sector enables a 2.6% value-add to other industries. It is also significant in terms of diversification of the economy. If you look at the contribution of ICT to GDP, which is 10% and has grown at a double-digit rate in the last five years, it is clear that the ICT sector provides a great opportunity for Nigeria to be a much more diversified economy.  The Nigerian telecommunications sector is one of the fastest growing sectors in the world. Total mobile subscriptions increased to 134.5 million as of September 2014, from 95 million in 2011. Tele-density increased to 96% in September 2014 from 68% in 2011, while the total mobile internet subscriptions increased to 73.8 million as of September 2014 (from 45 million in 2011). Internet penetration increased from 26.5% to 52% over the same period. The ICT sector is now viewed as a critical sector to the economy, on a par with the oil and gas sector. The improved environment assured by President Goodluck Jonathan's Transformation Agenda has helped create local companies that are innovating and adding value to the Nigerian economy. The Nigerian Telecoms sector is one of the fastest growing sectors in the world and continues to attract significant FDI. So its role as a catalyst for the economic growth that will ultimately lead us to becoming one of the twenty biggest economies in the world by 2020 is key and is one that we as a Ministry are continuously striving to cultivate and grow.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You have been entrusted with the task of planning, developing, and promoting the use of IT in Nigeria. How does National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) perform this task?<br></h4><p>We have a mandate to cover many aspects of IT in Nigeria, as well as to develop IT further. The first aspect covers standards, policies, guidelines, and the framework for IT development. The second aspect concerns community access. In 2001 NITDA became an independent national agency and adopted a national policy. I realized that the implementation of the NITDA mandate had been grossly overlooked, and therefore I created a department of guidelines, standards, and regulations. We created five governance frameworks for the country, without which it would be extremely difficult to develop IT in Nigeria. On the development side we have to look at the communities as the real beneficiaries because we are talking about access at the community level. There will ultimately be three sets of community telecenters. I have looked at the issue of integrating to work closely together with a common platform for managing these centers. To that end I am looking to promote a national telecenter support network.</p><h4>To what extent is the ICT sector a catalyst for the Nigerian economy?</h4><p>NITDA carries the greatest mandate of any agency in the country. Several countries have leveraged IT to reinvigorate their economies. We see IT as an important sector that has the potential to eclipse oil and gas as the primary source of national income. From that perspective we are aware that well-deployed IT will be a catalyst for growth across the sectors. It will transform other sectors and make them more efficient and productive. They will experience significant levels of growth as a result. From the perspective of our initial plan to adopt a more streamlined strategy, we have realized that relying on public funding alone will not be enough. Our average annual projects are worth about NGN10 billion. That is less than $50 million. We are looking to adopt a financial strategy whereby we engage the international community, and especially the UN system and various other organizations. We are also aware that each of the G8 countries always makes a statement on governmental resources to catalyze growth in Africa from the department of ICT. We are aware, too, that if we plan well, we can actually deploy sufficient resources from various sources, including CSR with the initiatives of local companies, such as Dangote and MTN.</p><h4>You mention that other countries have used IT as a developing tool. Are you trying to replicate any of their IT development programs?</h4><p>After the crisis in 1997, South Korea adopted an ICT-focused and ICT-driven economic recovery strategy. Clearly South Korea is a good example of what ICT can do for a country, as it started to contribute over 25% of economic growth. We have made an effort to engage South Korea to help drive our e-government program, which aims to train about 23,000 public servants. We are not just dreaming of benefiting from their experience. We have actually started to build direct engagement in order to benefit from their success story, and for example, have the South Korea Hyundai agreement that is supporting and funding some of our e-government programs. They have recently helped us implement an e-government master plan. We are trying to develop an e-government institute, and some of the funding will come from South Korea as well.</p><h4>What can you tell us about your vision of creating a Nigerian Silicon Valley?</h4><p>During my visits to Silicon Valley, I realized that passion underlies its success story. That passion manifested itself when I realized that the Lekki Free Zone has a great deal of potential with the new seaport, the new airport, and the coastal road that starts in Lagos. I was motivated to come up with the concept of “the digital coast" and started sharing that concept with the Lekki Free Zone Development Company. NITDA is set to commit to a 48-hectare acre facility in the zone to build a smart city on. This would create significant opportunities for everyone, including international investors. There is a digital fever that everyone is catching in Nigeria, and NITDA is a mayor player. We are building a knowledge city, and a software incubation hub.</p><h4>What is the importance of the triangle business model community telecenters?</h4><p>You need to engage the community. When you get the right buy-in from the community, it means that by the time you deploy a center, everyone knows where it is and what it is. Today there are so many things you can do with a center like that. It can be a one-stop-shop for services. From immigration paperwork to registering voters, registering your national identity number, providing the right information about government services, the right kind of internet access, and basic skills development for researching IT technology, all the way to what I call entrepreneurship. People can also hire the space for one or two hours and use it as a contact point to develop websites for local farmers or fishermen, for example. We want a holistic approach and a meeting point where everyone is involved.</p><h4>What goals have you set for the next five years and how do you see the ICT sector evolving towards 2020?</h4><p>What we need to do is aggressively position IT as the primary source of national income for Nigeria, and in the shortest possible time begin to compete with oil and gas so that the focus will gradually move away from them. I dream of a Nigerian economy driven by IT. Young entrepreneurs are truly transforming the economy. Under the guidance of our Minister, substantial efforts are going into incubation hubs. I also perceive a lack of the right performance indicators. That failure to perform is because IT has not been adequately promoted across all sectors. We are currently engaging with the ministries to get their support for the use of IT to drive productivity. We see IT as central to Nigeria's future in terms of driving performance across all sectors by acting as Nigeria's primary economic engine. I want to see IT contribute to the growth of the economy, the actual inflow of national income, and educational performance. Even if it does not surpass oil and gas, it will be the fastest growing sector of the economy. I would add that social media and cyber security are also important issues. Social media is gaining momentum in Nigeria. Unfortunately, there are some challenges. For example, we plan to develop a campaign to provide the necessary capacity among parents to be able to monitor how their children are using social media. In terms of cyber-security there is a national effort lead by the Office of the National Security Adviser. As we speak, the draft of the national cyber security policy is being written, and NITDA has played a central role in that. We already have a cyber-security center in place. Furthermore, we are currently building capacity for the military in terms of cyber-security issues.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do your services help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) run their businesses?<br></h4><p>The way IT has come to Nigeria and spread nationwide, especially for managers, has led us to significant automation of business processes. It is only the larger companies and multinational corporations that have all the basic, simple processes that bring efficiency, transparency, and cost-effectiveness to an organisation. Once you go beneath the largest bandwidth, by my estimation somewhere between 70% and 95% of all business processes, are still done manually. We view this as a huge gap in the market, and therefore decided to create less expensive versions of process automation solutions for the SME market. More importantly, rather than shoehorning existing solutions into these SMEs, our solutions had to be based on the realities of doing business in Nigeria. And that reality is that most Nigerian SMEs are competing domestically, which became our focus. By way of an example, if we consider any of the well-known international accounting or payroll solutions we hardly find one denominated in Nigerian currency, the naira. Very few of them allow the flexibility for Nigerian SMEs to exchange between the naira and other currencies with accuracy and convenience. Therefore, in building an accounting package for the local SME market our number one selling point is that it is denominated in naira. Our strategy is to seek out niche markets based on specific needs. This is where we find our greatest advantage, and where we add the most value.</p><h4>Is there any other segment of the market or specific area of the economy that you foresee bringing your services to?</h4><p>I would like to enter the risky and less crowded areas. We are not going to try the traditional areas where everybody has already launched themselves. I believe that Nigeria is going to change dramatically within the next two-five years, and that the change will be driven by technology.</p><h4>As technology plays an increasingly important role in Nigeria's new economy, how receptive do you think Nigerians are toward innovation?</h4><p>If we look at history, Nigerians are one of the largest subscribers to Facebook and LinkedIn and Twitter. At some point, Nigeria was the largest market for BlackBerry devices—that was a worldwide statistic. I will say that the Nigerian market is highly receptive.</p><h4>How receptive is the public sector in the same regard?</h4><p>I think the case is the opposite. In the public sector, the fact is that the business cycle and culture do not encourage anybody to take bold decisions. The problem is institutionalized, actually, to help prevent corruption and fraud, but I also think the price we are paying for it as a nation is too heavy. The Nigerian public sector is slow to make decisions, except when that decision has the particular logic of emergency. The fact that in some spheres of the public service we keep appointing, re-appointing, removing, and re-installing the key leaders and decision-makers, also does not help because most new leaders want to pursue a different agenda. All these factors work against productivity. The other factor that works against us in making decisions and being receptive to new technologies is our national budget. Sometimes up until April or May of the New Year, the national budget has not even been signed or approved. The ministries and administrators are told they can spend only a certain small percentage of the total budget—but not more, causing overall anxiety. Put all of these things together and you see the problem; while we have good people keen to seize the moment, more importantly, the system, the boundary conditions within which they must act on behalf of the general public, do not allow them to do much.</p><h4>As of June 2014, the ICT sector in Nigeria contributes 8% to GDP. Can the percentage rise in the future?</h4><p>I think it will grow rapidly. I expect competition in ICT to be enhanced in some dramatic way. I also believe the private sector will play a key role here. My other thought is that the security sector will play a central role in this. The Nigerian security forces, the state security service, the immigration service, the customs service—all of these agencies are going to adopt different technological solutions shortly. Once our people embrace technology and, it will dramatically enhance the contribution of ICT to our economy and well-being. The rest of the Nigerian public service will also make an important contribution. Not necessarily in hardware terms, but from in terms of software, in areas such as process automation, for example. There is a strong element of ethics and transparency in most of our software solutions. We are not providing these as services; they are nonetheless delivered to our clients by default. The truth is that you cannot deliver good ERP solutions without infusing ethics and transparency into the system.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>The rise of Africa is a fact. The continent's economic performance is impressive, not least in Nigeria, which shows staggering growth rates of 6% to 7% per year. The Netherlands is delighted that the Nigerian economy—now the 26th largest in the world—has taken off and is experiencing rapid growth year-after-year. Nigeria is already our main trading partner on the African continent. Bilateral trade has tripled over the past seven years, and we would like to continue contributing to Nigeria's growth by fostering mutually beneficial economic ties.<br></p><p>Dozens of Dutch companies are already established and active in Nigeria, not just in the oil and gas industry, but also in agriculture and manufacturing. And more and more Dutch industries are seeking to invest in Nigeria, because they feel that business opportunities are knocking on their door. In order to grasp those opportunities, two things are key: open markets and a diversified economy. We know this from experience.</p><p>Firstly, about a third of our annual income derives from international trade and investment. That is why the Netherlands is a strong advocate of keeping borders open and maintaining a level playing field for all businesses worldwide, large and small, so that they can compete in global markets on the basis of their merits. I am convinced that all countries, including Nigeria, can benefit if they adopt this approach.</p><p>Secondly, a diversified economy is key for each country to be able to compete on the increasingly sophisticated and innovative global scene. In the 1970s, our own economy was far from being as dynamic as it is today. Our gas reserves made us complacent, and it took a great deal of political will and far-reaching reforms to create the export-oriented economy we have today.</p><p>So I applaud the fact that diversifying the Nigerian economy—in agriculture, technology, retail trade, finance, and services—is one of the Nigerian government's main priorities. The challenges ahead include achieving equitable living standards for all Nigerians and strengthening the rule of law, which will also help to attract foreign investors.</p><p>My government expects Dutch companies to comply with the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is part of our business case. The Confederation of Netherlands Industry and Employers (VNO-NCW), which is comparable to the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN), has embraced CSR as a basic principle of sustainable business. FrieslandCampina, for example, is promoting the further development of Nigeria's dairy industry by working with cattle-breeding Fulani communities. Many other Dutch firms have similar projects in Nigeria and other countries. Sustainable growth requires inclusiveness, and CSR is a key tool for attaining it.</p><p>At the governmental level, too, Nigeria and the Netherlands are partnering for prosperity. In the spring of 2014, President Goodluck Jonathan visited the Netherlands. In June Lilianne Ploumen, the Dutch Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation headed a business delegation to Lagos. Some 35 Dutch entrepreneurs from the agrifood, maritime logistics, and life sciences and health sectors met with Nigerian counterparts. The mission immediately led to more economic collaboration and new opportunities.</p><p>So let us further deepen our relations, step up our political and economic contacts, and keep building mutual trust and understanding. I look forward to contributing to these goals and I am convinced it will be to the benefit of both our peoples.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Both Nigeria and Cí´te d'Ivoire are founders of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). How do you see the development of ECOWAS, and what are the prospects for the future?<br></h4><p>I would like to stress that ECOWAS is moving in the right direction. At a meeting in Dakar in 2013, we made some important decisions: First, it was decided that in 2015 there would be a common external tariff for goods that would be implemented by the presidential commission; secondly, the heads of states of ECOWAS wanted to have a single currency by 2020. As you know we have a common currency in the Western African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU); we want to link the Francophone countries with other West African countries and create a common currency for ECOWAS. There have been some improvements as far as the question of the security of citizens of member-state countries are concerned. Also, the presidential commission for ECOWAS is discussing with the EU how to forge a common approach on issues related to our cooperation. For many years, we have been discussing this, and we hope that soon the 15 countries will sign a cooperation agreement between ECOWAS and the EU. Apart from that, there are some projects that would reinforce relations between the various countries. For example, we are working on a toll highway to link five countries.</p><h4>What is needed to expedite the process of this major infrastructure project?</h4><p>The feasibility study is underway and needs to be completed, after which we can launch an international tender to build the highway. It will be 1,000 km in length, and run from Lagos to Abidjan and pass through Cotonou, Lomé, and Accra. It is an important project that is expected to cost between $3 billion and $5 billion. The private sector seems to be interested, including the financial sector. I think ECOWAS is the future for our region, because with 15 countries and 300 million inhabitants, it is a powerful political and economic group.</p><h4>How do you see the future of bilateral trade between Cí´te d'Ivoire and Nigeria?</h4><p>Nigeria is ranked first as a supplier of Cí´te d'Ivoire, even before France, due to its supply of oil. We have a refinery called Société ivoirienne de raffinage (SIR) in Abidjan with a large capacity. We buy oil from Nigeria, process it, and then either use it domestically or resell it to Nigeria and other ECOWAS countries. Hence, trade relations between our two countries are important. Nonetheless, we have to diversify our exports to Nigeria.</p><h4>World Economic Forum (WEF) has been held in West Africa for the first time. What is the importance of this?</h4><p>As the largest economy of Africa, I think that it is a sign of the role of Nigeria in the continent. This could also be beneficial to counties in ECOWAS as Nigeria is a leading member. Cí´te d'Ivoire considers Nigeria as a major trading partner. Holding such a prestigious forum here in Nigeria and in West Africa is important for the surrounding countries. First, it is easy to travel to Nigeria compared to other parts of Africa, and also it is a sign that both Africa and West Africa in particular have a good future. Africa's GDP rose by 5.4%, while the economies of West Africa grew by 6.5% in 2013. We want to build on this lead, and go as far as possible with regard to integration. We want to have an external tariff agreement by 2015, and full synchronization by 2020.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>If there is one key message I hear from UK companies in Nigeria, it's that there's a real desire to do more there. As our second largest trading partner in the sub-Saharan region, Nigeria is a vital partner for the UK in Africa—and the close relationship between the two countries presents an opportunity to build real shared prosperity. My first overseas visit as a Minister was to Abuja, and I also visited Nigeria as Chair of the British Parliament's All Party Group prior to joining the UK government. It's a partnership that's close to my heart.<br></p><p>One of our key objectives is to broaden the trading relationship, expanding from current areas of strength, such as energy, into new growth sectors. Oil and gas currently accounts for between 70 and 80 per cent of Nigerian Government and 90% of foreign exchange earnings. Expansion into new sectors will strengthen bilateral trade, making the relationship less exposed to fluctuations in the oil price.</p><p>The financial sector in particular offers fertile ground for the sharing of UK expertise. The UK Government's Emerging Capital Markets Taskforce is working with private sector partners, such as PwC, Standard Chartered, the Law Society and CityUK, to strengthen ties in Nigeria. The Head of the Taskforce, Sir Roger Gifford, was in Lagos in November 2014 to witness the signing of an agreement between the Nigerian and London Stock Exchanges to support African companies seeking dual listings in both locations. The Nigerian Stock Exchange will also need support to reduce its vulnerability to changes in the oil price and to achieve its target of $1 trillion market capitalization by 2016; but add to this insurance, bonds and the potential for the creation of a derivatives market, and the opportunities are significant.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Prime Minister's Trade Envoy to Nigeria, David Heath MP, is targeting other key sectors—agriculture, education, energy and retail - and encouraging more big-name UK firms to seize the chance to cater to Nigeria's growing middle class.</p><p>There has been a shift in the way people look at the Nigerian market since the rebasing of GDP earlier this year. We should make the most of the facts: Nigeria is the 23rd largest economy in the world, predicted to be in the top 20 by 2015, and Lagos alone is the 4th biggest economy in Africa.</p><p>There are numerous examples of well-known UK blue-chip companies established in Nigeria - Diageo, Unilever and GSK to name a few—giving the lie to any perception that the risks of doing business in-country are too high. However, continued effort to address the challenges that do exist will bolster this message. Nigeria has made progress in many areas, moving up the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business rankings to number 170. However, we must be realistic: the list totals only 189 countries, and the next closest MINT economy, Indonesia, ranks at 114. Nigeria is the second-lowest ranked country in sub-Saharan Africa.</p><p>Tackling the basics, such as the electricity supply, will go a long way towards improving this. The need for businesses to generate their own power presents a major cost that, for Small and Medium Enterprise, is not easy to absorb. Yet the country's gas stocks offer the opportunity to revolutionize power supply. So maintaining the momentum in reform of the power sector is crucial. Implementation of this reform, with the support of the UK Government and UK business, will allow the Nigerian Government to mitigate risks and attract more investment.</p><p>By 2050, according to some estimates, Nigeria will have the third largest population in the world. To make the most of the opportunities this will bring, it is vital that the country's long term growth is inclusive. Spreading the dividends of diversification is as important as diversification itself. Currently, agriculture accounts for two thirds of employment and almost 27% of GDP, but most workers earn less than $1.25 per day, and the sector has been neglected in recent years. The Nigerian Government is taking action, for example by investing in power and infrastructure.  While the planned Petroleum Industries Bill (PIB) must ensure the country's oil wealth is equitably shared, properly invested and that the sector continues to attract international investors.</p><p>Maintaining this momentum will be key to unlocking Nigeria's growth in the years ahead. The UK stands ready to be Nigeria's partner of choice.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What services does LADOL provide?<br></h4><p>LADOL is a 100% privately owned, deep-offshore logistics base. We provide maritime, oil and gas, and general manufacturing support services through the creation of a small industrial village. We have invested $450 million in building an infrastructure that assists various industries in setting up business in Nigeria for the first time. The reason these industries can set up here so easily is because firstly, the environment we have created is built around a specialized port facility. And secondly, it provides 24/7 services and operations, which enable companies to operate with a level of efficiency similar to what they would expect in more advanced economies. We also have training facilities for Nigerian staff, and our aim is to fill the infrastructural and operational gaps that otherwise prevent foreign companies from operating within Nigeria's economy. By filling those gaps, we have attracted new investment. Through our Phase II development, for example, we are creating 50,000 new jobs, and we anticipate that over the next five years we will attract between $2 billion and $2.5 billion in FDI.</p><h4>Could you elaborate on the purpose of LADOL's joint venture with Samsung?</h4><p>It was our intention to develop to a point where we would attract a foreign company to be our technical partner in building a facility that would have a strategically significant impact on the Nigerian economy. The facility we are building with Samsung is an offshore fabrication and vessel-integration facility. It is essentially a shipbuilding facility, intended to build and repair a wide range of vessels. The first contract is to build a floating production, storage, and offloading vessel (or FPSO) for the Egina project. This is in fact a Total Upstream Nigeria project: the creation of a new, deep-water, offshore block. The facility we are building is not only the first of its kind in Nigeria; it is also the first and largest of its kind in Africa. It is also the first time that Samsung has partnered with a company to build a facility in Africa. And so it marks a significant moment for Nigerian local content. For the past 30 years, 90% of Nigerian oil and gas projects have been executed by outside the country. By passing the Local Content Act, however, the government showed that local content was paramount. This move enabled Nigeria's private sector to step in and help make local content a reality through their long-term investments, which is what we have done,  to create the infrastructure required for greater domestication and to meet world-class expectations. We are looking to ensure that as much as possible of the maritime sector will be domesticated in Nigeria because we want the country to become the primary hub for oil and gas and the maritime industry within the West African region. The fact that Nigeria has this facility creates a huge multiplier effect and the partnership we have with Samsung is one of many we plan to strike up.</p><h4>What goals have you set for LADOL for the coming five years?</h4><p>Phase I, the logistics base, is now complete, at a cost of around $150 million. Phase II is an expansion and upgrade of the logistics facilities to include a new fabrication and integration yard, and this will create around 50,000 jobs. Phase III involves further expansion and the building of a dry dock, which will be the largest in West Africa, and which could lead to the creation of as many as 100,000 jobs. In addition to building up the facilities within LADOL, we also want to strengthen collaboration between facilities in Nigeria. Our aim is to build clusters of facilities: engineering, steel manufacturing, general fabrication, offshore fabrication, and human capital development, developing capability right across the country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[stand-together]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you elaborate on the mandate of the Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON)?<br></h4><p>SON is a government agency that acts as a national standards group for Nigeria and is also involved in the quality assurance of all products. Our regulatory regime is limited to non-food and non-drug items. We do not handle food or drugs, except at the level of the elaboration of standards. All standards in Nigeria are elaborated in line with international practice. Our role has actually dovetailed into being part of a trade facilitation team. For example, if Nigeria wants to promote exports, the typical Nigerian exporter may not understand European standards, whereupon it is our responsibility to ensure sufficient testing such that when Nigerian products are exported, they are not rejected. If, for example, there is a standard for cement in Europe, and we lack our own standard, we adopt that of the European market, making it easier for us to trade with those nations. We also create so-called Mutual Recognition Agreements (MRAs) between countries allowing them to freely trade with one another. Our role is not limited to the original mandate of quality assurance. Any product entering Nigeria must be certified by us, especially those classified as life-endangering products such as tires, reinforcement bars, or toys. Therefore, standards must define the health, safety, and environmental impact. There is also a performance role. If a foreign manufacturer has been breaching standards, we have the responsibility to blacklist it from selling in Nigeria. We have not fine-tuned this mechanism, but have created a better base today for ensuring that such manufacturers and their local counterparts are not allowed to deal in Nigeria, from whom we block access to foreign exchange in cooperation with the Central Bank. In 2011, there was a huge volume of substandard products in Nigeria, and we observed that the nation had effectively experienced deindustrialization. Local manufacturers found themselves competing with substandard products. Yet, the fight is on, and we are taking it beyond Nigeria in order to set a pan-African standardization precedent.</p><h4>You recently outlined an agenda with multiple strategy points for SON. What can you tell us about this?</h4><p>Firstly, it is essential to improve the competitiveness of Nigerian-made products. Secondly, there is no quality control infrastructure, in other words, no accreditation body. And neither do we have a peer review mechanism with other accredited organizations in other parts of the world. Therefore, our test results are not yet applicable in Europe and America, as a result of which our exports lose substantial value. So, we are currently working on establishing quality infrastructure and creating an accreditation body. In another example, we have a metrology laboratory, but need to upgrade it to a metrological institute. We also need to harness the private sector through public-private partnerships (PPPs). Thirdly, our agenda is to create awareness by engaging the consumer in Nigeria. To achieve that, we also have media engagement and make sure the media is sufficiently trained and best positioned to disseminate information on what we are doing. Fourth, aggressive conformity assessment helps us to make sure that products imported from China are tested there by certified companies before being shipped. The system, while improved, is not yet 100% perfected. We are set to conduct a review at the end of 2014 because looking ahead we are keen to deepen our relationship with SMEs, which comprise the bulk of the economy, contributing the most to GDP and employing the most people. To maximize their efficiency, we need to engage them in awareness of each other's particular offering. For example, a community that assembles vehicles loses out to China if a client wants to purchase engine oil and lubricant, despite the fact that companies just 2 km away are able to provide them, thus, benefiting the local economy. Our responsibility is to create such linkages.</p><h4>What would you offer to foreign firms keen to partner with the agency?</h4><p>We need partnerships in the area of standards elaboration. Some of the multinationals have certain experience in areas where our experience is lacking. That becomes an area of collaboration; they teach us. Secondly, Nigeria has developed an automotive policy, but has yet to develop the capacity to certify vehicles. We need to be able to build capacity, to have the knowledge base to be able to certify these vehicles, and to be able to check them against established standards. Also, we need people to set up testing centers and standards development organizations.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<p>The need to create jobs is a global challenge. The International Labor Organization estimates that in 2013 over 200 million people were unemployed around the world; this included about 75 million young people between the ages of 15-24. Practically all countries around the world are concerned about job creation. The developed economies, such as the US, the UK, and Euro zone countries are all closely monitoring their employment numbers to assess whether their economies are recovering from the recent global recession. In southern European countries, such as Spain and Portugal, unemployment rates have remained high in recent years at above 20%. In fact, there have been many reported cases of reverse migration of young graduates from Portugal and Spain, who are now moving back to their former colonies such as Angola, Brazil, and Mozambique to seek jobs. In Africa, we also have our employment challenges. The unemployment rates today exceed 20% in many of our countries—Nigeria is at about 24%, and South Africa at 25%.</p><p> second point I want to make is that in Africa, the unemployment problem is compounded by our youthful population and pending demographic transition. As you know Africa's population is young. And while other continents are “aging," in contrast Africa's population of young people is growing. African leaders therefore face special challenges. We principally face the challenge of providing jobs, housing and healthcare. If you walk down the streets in Europe, the median age of the person you see is about 40 years. In Asia, the median age of the person on the street is 29 years. In Africa, the median age is just 20 years, which means that about half of the African population today is under the age of 20 years.</p><p>Demographers are also predicting that this youth population is set to grow further. Consulting firm McKinsey has calculated that an additional 122 million workers will enter Africa's labor force by 2020. Accordingly, by 2035, the combined size of the African labor force will be greater than that of the most heavily populated countries in the world, including China. This is daunting, and should be a wake-up call to all of us in Africa to work harder on job creation with a great sense of urgency. We have many young people who are unemployed, but who also do not necessarily have the required competencies or skills, even if the jobs are available, which again, is a major challenge.</p><p>Nigeria has grown rapidly over the past decade—at about 7% per annum. Of course we are now also the largest economy on the continent and the 26th largest in the world. After our GDP rebasing exercise, our print for 2013 is now estimated at about $510 billion. Yet, the quality of our growth has been less than desirable in the sense that we are not creating as many decent jobs as we need to. That is why we have focused on a number of priority sectors of high job-creation potential, such as agriculture, manufacturing, housing and construction, and the services sectors. And in each of these sectors, we are working to unlock the various obstacles faced by businesses so they create jobs. We are learning from the example of other countries - such as China - to see what they have done in this regard to create jobs for their citizens.</p><p>In addition, in the short-term we have introduced special government initiatives, such as a business plan competition for young entrepreneurs (called YouWiN), which provides equivalent grants of between $10,000-$90,000 to the best business plans. This program has thus far supported more than 2,400 young entrepreneurs, who have created more than 26,000 jobs. We also have a Graduate Internship Scheme that places recent graduates in private sector jobs. Also, there is a public works program as part of our Subsidy Re-investment Program (SURE-P), which has created about 120,000 jobs. Overall, the National Bureau of Statistics estimates that 1.6 million jobs were created across the country over the past 12 months, but my Administration is not relenting because we are aware that even more jobs are needed to support our growing youth population.</p><p>Finally, as we continue our discussions today, let us also remember the challenge of tackling inequality. Today, we all know that the African continent is rising: our economic growth is strong, our social indicators are improving, and our middle class is expanding. However, we must ensure that the poorer and vulnerable members of our societies are also carried along. We need economic growth, but we must work to ensure that this growth is inclusive. In Africa, most of our countries must begin to think about introducing social protection measures building on the strong traditions we already have of caring for one another. Our friends in Latin America have more knowledge in this area and can share some of their experiences with us. We are looking, for example, at former Brazilian President Lula's work to create the Bolsa Famí­lia, which is a conditional cash transfer program to support low-income families and lift them off the bottom rung of the ladder. It has been a successful program, and an example to learn from.</p><p>Africa faces difficult challenges in the years ahead to provide adequate infrastructure, create jobs, and develop the skills of its young population. But the continent also faces a tremendous opportunity to harness its young population in a manner than can provide unique dividends to its people.</p><p>As we debate these issues over the coming days, let us raise our sights, let us think big and bold, and let us think for the long-term. And together, let us work to realize the potential of this great continent. I believe that collectively, with the caliber of men and women we have here, the institutions they represent, the fact that democracy has come to stay in Africa, and with the political will and commitment of African leaders, we will make decisions and the right steps, to lift Africa to greater heights.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The past 9M results showed considerable growth for Zenith compared to the 2013 results. What were the main drivers of this growth?<br></h4><p>The economy itself is growing across most of the sectors. If you compare this with 2013, you note that the power sector is a major growth area, as a result of its privatization. There is now considerable activity in both generation and distribution, and to a certain extent even transmission. We are committed to the sector, given its potential to become a major catalyst of economic growth. In 2014, activities in the upstream oil and gas sector were also a considerable driver, primarily the divestment by Shell of four major assets, which totaled in excess of $5 billion, and which was largely financed by local banks. There is still a range of capacities to be developed in the upstream segment and the power sector, whereby these areas will remain key drivers throughout 2015 and beyond.</p><h4>Zenith's foreign banking subsidiaries are contributing increasingly to group profit. Are you looking to expand the current number of subsidiaries?</h4><p>We are not too bullish about this prospect. At Zenith Bank UK, we are doing well in terms of numbers. We broke even in our first year and continue to achieve notable growth there. Today, our non-performing loans are at 0%, after operating for eight years in that particular economy. Most of our trade finance activities are gaining increased market shares, not just in the UK, but also by transactions routed through the UK to China. There are still growth opportunities for Zenith Bank UK. In Ghana, we have about 40 branches and rank among the top five banks there. Furthermore, in 2013, we were voted bank of the year in Ghana. Our objective is to consolidate, as we do not want a universal presence, but rather to be in the major economies, such as Ghana.</p><h4>Our readership includes foreign investors who are looking to enter the Nigerian market. What makes Zenith Bank a suitable partner for such individuals?</h4><p>As a bank, we stand for consistency, predictability, and stability. We will always do things at the highest level of governance, which has brought us to where we are today. Zenith Bank is only 24 years old, but we are the largest banking institution in Nigeria in terms of shareholder funds, while in total asset terms we rank number two. With regard to profitability, however, we are the number one entity. Zenith Bank is seen as being genuinely focused on service and innovation, and we will continue to do this, and to focus on our service quality, people, and technology in order to excite our customers. If we continue in this vein, there is no reason why investors would not turn to us. In fact, we have a greater number of multinational clients than any other bank in Nigeria.</p><h4>How is Zenith Bank making the most of the IT revolution unfolding in Nigeria?</h4><p>At Zenith Bank, we are deeply interested in technology. Prior to 2000, teledensity in Nigeria was less than 1 million, while today, it is at around 100 million. Aware of this infrastructure deficiency at the time, we established the necessary services to enable us to provide a telecommunications network for all of our branches. This helped in terms of our real-time banking at that time. And if we were able to accomplish that then, you can imagine what we can do now. We have broadband access everywhere. In 1990, all of our branches were already linked on a real-time basis. There were many people who could not afford that at the time. Yet this helped us a lot with multinationals, because it enabled companies to pay from anywhere in the country, and that was part of the reason why most of the multinationals preferred to use Zenith Bank.</p><h4>How is Zenith bank promoting financial inclusion in Nigeria?</h4><p>There are a number of initiatives in place from the Central Bank and the finance committee. We all need to have a common front to ensure that we have many people involved. We have over 400 locations, but in a country as big as Nigeria with a population of 150 million people that is not sufficient. If you look at all the other banks, you see that we need innovation to gain adequate coverage. We were one of the first banks to launch mobile money. We are investing in this area because we believe the benefits will come quickly and help in terms of enhancing the payment system. One of the ways in which we promote financial inclusion is by leveraging agency banking, which offers banking services to villages.</p><h4>Banks are facing some regulatory headwinds because of a tighter monetary policy. Do you see room for improvement in the regulations?</h4><p>If you consider monetary tightening objectively, the truth is that this is the right way to go. You cannot have your cake and eat it too—either you want stable exchange rates, or else you want high interest rates, but you cannot have both at the same time. In a developing economy such as this, where we rely so much on imports, exchange rate stability is key. Therefore, we support the CBN's attempt to stabilize the exchange rate. The good thing is that while tightening the money supply, the CBN has managed to control interest rates to a large extent, which is normally hard to accomplish.</p><h4>What is your outlook on the Nigerian economy for the next two years, especially in light of falling oil prices and the subsequent pressure on the Naira?</h4><p>Both the CBN and the Minister for the Economy have taken swift, proactive steps and implemented measures to offset pressures on the economy stemming from falling oil prices. I am somewhat bullish about the future of the economy, although there are quite a number of steps that need to be taken to reduce our import dependence. Refineries need to be established to lower the amount of foreign exchange consumption on petroleum products. We are also undergoing rapid agricultural development. Nigeria, for example, is the second largest importer of rice, but we are going to reduce this considerably. Once we reduce our dependence on imports, we will ease the pressure on our currency, and in general I predict that we will see exciting developments over the next two years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In July 2010 you created a six-point agenda for the NCC. How would you rate your progress in these areas over the past four years?<br></h4><p>During this period, the subscriber base of the telecommunications industry has risen from 80 million in 2010 to over 134.5 million by the end of September, 2014. We have increased teledensity from 60% to 96.08% within the period, and the industry's contribution to GDP has risen from 5% in 2010 to 8.6% today. Apart from that, from the perspective of regulatory interventions, we have enabled customers to retain their mobile numbers through mobile number portability, which has increased competition. I was recently elected chair of the Commonwealth Telecommunications Organization; one thing I promised was that we will increase our presence in the international forum. Today, Nigeria is a council member of the International Telecommunications Union. We have also started the implementation of our broadband project, which will move Nigeria toward becoming a knowledge-based economy. I think we have done quite well over the past four years.</p><h4>Investment in the telecoms sector has increased to $32 billion. How has the NCC facilitated this investment and how do you assess the opportunities for future investment in Nigeria?</h4><p>MTN is an excellent example; it started operations in Nigeria expecting a market of 250,000 customers, but today has 55 million customers on its network, and is generating billions of dollars in profits. We run campaigns at numerous events held by the International Telecommunications Union, all of which are carefully developed and coordinated to encourage the interest of international investors in Nigeria. Over time, Nigeria has become the first stop for investment among the developing countries. Our market is the fastest growing in Africa; one of the key reasons is trust in our regulatory environment, which provides a level playing field for all participants.</p><h4>Will the upcoming broadband services rollout unleash a data revolution in Nigeria?</h4><p>Nigeria has made strides in voice services, but still lags in data services. Today broadband penetration in Nigeria is just 6.1%, and the government has come up with a broadband plan for 30% penetration by 2018. So we are trying to align with this plan by implementing a broadband project. One of the key facets of this project is infrastructure companies (InfraCos). These are divided into the seven areas of Nigeria. We have completed the bidding process for the first pilot, and will soon issue the license.</p><h4>What are the opportunities for foreign investors to key into the data revolution?</h4><p>Nigerian law does not place limitations on foreign holdings. This openness is actually exemplary; we are probably the only emerging market to have such an environment. The only criterion stipulated is registration in Nigeria, and aside from that, an operation can be 100% foreign owned. There has been increased foreign participation in Nigeria's telecommunications industry. We are encouraging companies to participate in the stock market and hope to see increased foreign investment, but also a rise in foreign-Nigerian partnerships.</p><h4>Do you have any incentives or policies in place to support indigenous players?</h4><p>The telecommunications revolution in Nigeria has sidestepped part of our local population; most of the companies here are huge foreign entities. Nigerians feel they should move in step with this juggernaut; so the government has started to implement a local content policy. We are looking at restructuring the value-added services of the sector, such that our local creative population can piggyback these foreign companies. Additionally, there are benefits to providing services that do not require the capital outlay of facility-based companies, like MTN. We are optimistic that the local population will participate in the revolution that we are witnessing today.</p><h4>Are you encouraging foreign players to team up with indigenous firms?</h4><p>Our pursuits in this regard are already seeing results. Our president was in South Africa some time ago where he persuaded firms to come to Nigeria and list on the stock market to increase local participation. It is not easy for companies to share their profitability, but they realize that to fit into the local economic climate requires willingness to create mutual success.</p><h4>Will ICT eventually eclipse the oil and gas sector?</h4><p>The ICT sector is growing faster than the oil and gas sector. ICT contributes greatly to the GDP, while also playing a critical role in the oil and gas industry, and therefore is a foundation infrastructure. Nobody thought that ICT would overtake the banks in terms of contribution to GDP. With the advent of broadband and the explosion it promises, it is highly likely, therefore, that we will overtake the oil and gas sector.</p><h4>What are you doing to improve the quality of service provided by the operators?</h4><p>There are two major impediments to high-quality service. The first is the improvement of capacity by service providers; this needs investment from their side in order to match the growing subscriber base and avoid network congestion, one of the primary detractors of service quality. This is completely under the control of the service providers. Yet certain issues are caused by government agencies at both the Federal and State levels. These agencies are locking out base stations and not providing premises to build new ones. They routinely promise to provide premises but have yet to do so. The regulator is always blamed, but the blame lies in the inability of all parties to realize that growth of this industry requires cooperation. The State Governments view telecoms as a revenue source, so a base station translates directly into tax revenue. However, with taxation in Nigeria, telecom taxation goes to the Federal Government, and worst of all, when these fees are not paid they lock the base stations. Lock-outs at base stations create quality of service issues. Also, there is rampant vandalism of these facilities. In conjunction with the government, we are championing a bill to criminalize such vandalism.</p><h4>The NCC's activities are said to be transparent. Is this due to the Communications Act, the people operating it, or the government?</h4><p>Transparency is a product of all of the above. The Communications Act mandates a certain level of performance. The NCC must intervene to keep the industry in line with this law in a highly transparent manner. The service providers move to abide by these rules. This keeps them confident of their operations. When we do penalize them, providers cooperate because they realize that we are maintaining order. The government gives us sufficient leeway to operate without interference. For example, it does not tell us whom to grant licenses or allocate a frequency band to. The government and related organizations keep the spirit of the law, which has fostered growth in Nigeria's telecommunications industry. As a result, investors are assured that their investment will be protected and that their operations will be correctly regulated.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Which services and innovations will you bring to the Nigerian market?<br></h4><p>In terms of our subscriber base, Airtel is the fourth largest telecoms company in the world and has a major presence in India. In March 2014, Transparency International (TI) voted this the fourth most transparent emerging market in the world. In Nigeria, we are the second largest operator with over 26 million subscribers. Naturally, our ambition is to reclaim market leadership in the highly competitive Nigerian telecoms market and, already, we are renowned for our revolutionary approach. In December 2010, we took the market by storm when we launched the innovative 2good value offering, a mobile proposition designed to empower customers toward realizing the full potential of our network. It is also on record that we have the widest 3.75G coverage in Nigeria, and were the first to complete a 4G LTE trial in the country. We also rolled out the high-definition voice service to deepen customer experiences on our network. It is very clear that the next main frontier in the Nigerian telecoms sector will be the data revolution, and we are taking steady steps to ensure we lead the market when it happens. In short, whenever someone thinks about internet or data, we want to be the first name that comes to mind.</p><h4>How has consumer demand changed, and how will it evolve in the future?</h4><p>Years ago, the customer demanded SMS and voice, but now you see that the demand is strongly moving toward data. When you have a country where over half the population is under the age of 25, this doesn't come as a surprise. They use WhatsApp, Viber, and other messaging applications to communicate, which in effect has also changed the way we view customer behavior.</p><h4>What improvements to the telecoms environment do you foresee? Should regulations further support the private sector?</h4><p>From the government's perspective, we need to step up the pace of energy sector reform. On the regulatory side, we are working with the Ministry of Communication and the National Communication Commission (NCC) to reform the legislative landscape. For some reason, we are subjected to charges levied by different bodies—the federal government, state governments, local governments, communities, and others. Telecommunications is basically seen as a source of revenue, which in practice means that, periodically, we are levied arbitrary charges. We are working withthe Ministry of Communication and the NCC to formulate a more predictable environment. However, we are not shying away from developing local communities; we simply want a predictable and cohesive environment. Sometimes, we do not see any relationship between the rental charges we pay and the value we derive from those communities. At the end of the day, we are a business, hence I would like to see all the stakeholders come together to play a stronger role in addressing this issue. Another area of concern relates to the laying of fiber for our network. For fiber to be laid, one needs access to dig and lay the cable in the ground; a hugely difficult undertaking. If all stakeholders come together, we can work out a solution to these challenges to make it easier for Airtel and other players to achieve their ambitions.</p><h4>Where do you see the next challenges and opportunities?</h4><p>Nigeria is a blessed country with a population approaching 170 million people; quite large in relation to a relatively small area, which is a delight for any company or investor. It is not only the sheer size of the population that is of interest, but also its composition, with over 50% of the population less than 25 years old. These are the people who account for the bulk of consumption, and who drive growth in most sectors of the economy. We are beginning to see many Nigerians who had hitherto moved abroad returning home, and many skilled individuals returning with solid skill sets and know-how, which is changing the landscape of Nigeria. I think the best is yet to come.</p><h4>What advantages does the National Broadband Plan have?</h4><p>The National Broadband Plan was drafted by stakeholders and the government. There is the no requirement for the commitment of any telecoms company; it is a voluntary project to create a connected society. This is a strong value-added service, and the government has avoided creating a sense of obligation as companies voluntarily contribute in the interests of the economy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you provide a brief overview of the company and the type of services it provides?<br></h4><p>SSL was established in 1994 as a software development company and the first to develop packaged software for small, and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). The first product we developed was accounting software used by our parent company. We discovered that accounting packaged applications was a good market for us, and proceeded to package the product for many SMEs. Ten years later we diversified and launched tax and human resources software. As our market grew, we began to see new entrants and strong competitors in the likes of Microsoft and Sage, which drove us to continue diversifying. As our clients grew, so did their IT infrastructure and security services. This market need led to SSL reengineering our business, and we became McAfee's first business partner in our region over a decade ago.  Four years ago, I was brought in to transform the SSL business from an integration company to an information technology service provider with a more consultancy-based approach. We continued to develop custom applications for our diverse clients, and most importantly investing in our people, utilizing the local talents, which is a major shift in Nigeria.</p><h4>SSL has an impressive roster of clients that includes the Dangote Group, OANDO, and the Central Bank of Nigeria. What was the appeal to these companies?</h4><p>These companies have been with us for over a decade, but I can say that we always have a first move advantage; sometimes we are even too early. We are able to catch customers at the right time and are well known for our service and highly committed to ensuring that our customers are satisfied with the services we provide. Our main focus in all our dealings with our customers is building and maintaining customer satisfaction. We are passionate in what we deliver and how we deliver it.</p><h4>You have several strategic partnerships with Microsoft and McAfee, are you currently looking for others?</h4><p>We are interested in companies that are looking to invest in Nigeria (West Africa), especially those that will be interested in establishing a hub in Nigeria. It's all about global expertise being localized. I see SSL as a company that can marry international firms wanting to enter our market and create value for our customers through real partnership. Our current partners are McAfee, Citrix, and IBM. These partnerships enable SSL to meet some of its goals, but ultimately SSL's goal is to be an African IT Service brand on the global stage. We think most companies in this sector should be looking for real value creating partnerships and global firms that see their hub in West Africa, not only for generating sales, but also for services and solution development, as well as expertise.</p><h4>Have you already expanded beyond Nigeria's borders?</h4><p>We are already doing business in Liberia and Cameroon, and hopefully soon in Sierra Leone as well, and are reaching out to local partners in these markets. SSL worked with the Ministry of Finance on virtualization, as well providing consultancy services to the Central Bank to create e-payments services. We are looking for local partners in other neighbouring countries and identify where we can build and grow the industry and sector. Our partnerships with local firms focus on transferring skills that allow our customers to undertake cost effective IT projects. We are devising ways to increase our customers' revenue, while also lowering their long-term costs with web services and solutions. We are collaborating with some of our customers and introducing solutions that are no longer seen as capital expenditure, but as operational expenditure, hence, freeing up funds for business growth.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the Nigerian ICT sector today?</h4><p>Today many people in Nigeria have an impressively fast connection at home; they even have 4G on their smartphones. When BlackBerry and smart phones entered the market, it really changed the way that even older generations perceived and used technology. Customer decisions on whether or not to consume new technology are what determine the local technology sector. Making a business manageable, sustainable and measurable is something that needs to be automated as you move from a start up to an enterprise. It is not only a matter of hardware, but also of the software and services that go along with it. And technology is an enabler for businesses; it is not the genesis of a business strategy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You are currently developing the iconic Saraya Bandar Jissah Integrated Tourism Complex. Could you give us an overview of this project and tell us what the importance is of having Omran as a partner?<br></h4><p>The Saraya Bandar Jissah project is located in the touristic hub of Muscat, nestled between the Al Hajar Mountains and looking out onto a pristine and secluded bay. The $600 million project has 398 exclusive residential units comprised of villas, townhouses, duplexes, and apartments spread over five zones, as well as two luxury five-star hotels operated by Jumeirah Hotels &amp; Resorts, which are located on the beautiful beachfront. The site covers 2.2 square kilometers and will also include a recreational complex, staffing accommodation, and a technical zone. Saraya Bandar Jissah effortlessly balances the best aspects of an ITC while maintaining the natural beauty of the site. Great effort has been made in marrying together a sleek and individual modern design with the traditional surroundings of Bandar Jissah, incorporating traditional Omani architectural themes and design elements. Saraya Bandar Jissah will be a recognizably Omani development through the extensive use of local materials, which number over half of the development materials, and include locally-sourced cabling and wiring, window materials, and marble as well as design elements specific to Oman. The recreation club located in the center of the development will offer a community hub for all the residents. Offering everything from your daily shop to dining out, or a full work out to relaxing by the infinity pool. The Club also boasts stunning views over the park and includes a restaurant, coffee shop, pool, and gym. What makes this project unique is that there will be two luxury hotels perched on the beach, offering tourists a distinctly boutique or resort experience depending on their choice, and we are proud to partner with the pioneers in the hospitality business, Jumeirah Hotels &amp; Resorts. Omran, as the investment arm of the government in terms of tourism and hospitality projects is our partner shareholder in the development, which gives the market real confidence in the quality of the project, both with locals and expatriates, who are coming to invest and buy properties. Omran has already established a very good name in the market, and has already constructed many new hotels and properties around Oman. We believe it is adding great value to Saraya Bandar Jissah.</p><h4>What are the main challenges you are facing in the development of the first phase?</h4><p>We are glad to say that we aren't facing any major challenges. The sales activities launching this month are keeping us on our toes. As Saraya Bandar Jissah is the only ITC launched in the last seven years, it is a challenge in terms of a comparable track record of sales work. We're really pleased with the feedback we're getting and are proud of the quality of the product we are presenting to the market. It was a challenge in terms of the economic crisis a few years ago and the resultant delay. We have made significant efforts to understand the market thoroughly and also gain the trust of the people. Since we have begun the construction activity before selling housing units, we have been successful in instilling trust in the buyers that we are here to stay, and ensuring they receive the maximum return on investment.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance of Oman for STFA?<br></h4><p>The Sultanate of Oman is a country where STFA, having successfully completed several iconic projects since 2000, can play a major role in Oman's construction industry and enjoy long-term growth. We find Oman to be a secure place, as the regulations are applied and the business community follows them.</p><h4>How would you assess the importance of Duqm for the nation, and what were the main challenges during this project?</h4><p>Being a part of the construction and development of the new Port of Duqm, and as an international Turkish company, STFA successfully completed and delivered the project. Since the Port of Duqm will play a vital role in Oman's transportation sector, as well as in ongoing investments in other sectors, STFA's participation in the construction of the port has remarkably consolidated its reputation in the entire region. In Duqm, we didn't face any major obstacles other than those resulting from natural sea conditions.</p><h4>You have been awarded the OMR40 million coastal road project in the Musandam governorate. What other iconic projects do you have in your portfolio?</h4><p>STFA has recently received the letter of commencement for the Mussanah Sewage Network project from the MRM&amp;WR. We are also waiting for the letter of commencement from the Musannah Fishery Harbor. The government is putting much importance on the fisheries sector, making a huge investment in this field; during the signing ceremony for one of our fisheries projects, the Minister himself confessed that Oman has never invested such a consistent amount of money in this sector. We are currently involved in two fishery harbor projects, and we are joining the tender for the Duqm fishing harbor as well, in a joint venture with CCC. We are waiting for the results of that tender. As concerns the megaproject category, we are submitting for pre-qualification on the Mirbat Naval Base project floated by the Ministry of Defense.</p><h4>What are the biggest challenges and opportunities faced when working in this country?</h4><p>Information passes very slowly between departments, and you have to monitor the process carefully. Omanization is also another major issue for us. In our sector, we are required to achieve 30% Omanization, but we are not able to find the right sort of qualified people and to solve this we are conducting in-house training. This is not enough, and we are still not finding the right people. We even have Omanis taking the course and then leaving, and the reason that they do this is because the Omani government pays good money to qualified individuals with experience in international organizations, such as ourselves. Omanis prefer to work in the public sector, because they consider working for international companies as a risk, because we may leave once a contract is over.</p><h4>How does your experience in Oman help STFA to develop projects in other countries in the region?</h4><p>In the Middle East, apart from the Sultanate of Oman, we are active in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Iraq, Kuwait, Morocco, and the UAE. Being here in Oman since 2003 in various projects, I have developed a good business relationship with various ministries and clients. To a great extent, these relationships have helped me to ease the difficulties in many matters related to the execution of projects and other associated concerns. Although we have country heads in other parts of the Middle East, I share the market studies and vigilant follow-ups with the other country heads in coordination with the top management at the Turkish headquarters.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How are you supporting the creation of a diversified economy in Oman?<br></h4><p>Agriculture is a traditional sector and has been the basis of the national economy since long before the discovery of oil. More than half of the country's population is connected directly and indirectly to the agriculture and fisheries sector. The Omani economy is passing through the diversifying process by focusing on other renewable resources. This includes agriculture, fisheries, and mining along with tourism, oil, and logistics. Today, agriculture and fisheries contribute to almost 33.5% of total food consumption in the country, and its contribution to GDP grew by 8.6% in 2013. Almost 33.3% of its production was exported in 2013. Agricultural production increased by 19%, livestock production increased by almost 15.6%, and fisheries production increased by nearly 7.8% in terms of tonnage in 2013. The agriculture sector is creating more employment opportunities in the farm and non-farm (including agro-industry) sectors for the rural youth as well as rural women. This is also expected to increase agricultural output in real terms, increase value added, and provide an adequate source of livelihood for the rural areas. The sector is capable of significantly increasing the exports within the region as well.</p><h4>How is the Ministry encouraging international investment in Oman's agriculture and fisheries?</h4><p>Oman has an investment regime that is favorable to foreign investors in the agriculture and fisheries sector. These include: tax exemptions on the repatriation of investments and income; a stable political and legal environment; excellent infrastructure connecting Oman to all major international destinations; major government investments in internal infrastructure in Oman, including new ports, airports, highways, and communications; support from the Public Authority for Investment Promotion and Export Development (PAIPED); no restrictions on sectors where investments may be entered into by foreigners up to a 70% ratio; active promotion schemes to match FDI with local investment fund sources; and potential for “cross investments" with Omani funds also going to the incoming investor's company in other countries. The Ministry has also dedicated staff and departments to assist potential investors, find partners, and negotiate contracts in Oman supporting new projects.</p><h4>Food imports to Oman are set to grow to $5 billion by 2020. How will you ensure that the price of food will remain stable?</h4><p>The FAO estimates around $4.8 billion of food imports to Oman by 2020, a quantum jump from 2010 estimates of $2.1 billion. This is expected mainly as a result of population growth, increasing income and expenditure levels, and an increase in tourism. Oman's food imports include mainly grains, seasonal fruits, dairy products, poultry, and meat. To counter the vagaries of price fluctuation arising from external dependence on supplies, the Public Authority for Stores and Food Reserves (PASFR) works toward streamlining the procurement and supply of essential food commodities for the country. This includes sourcing optimal quantities at the right time, from the right sources, and at the right price. Plans are afoot for the construction of food storage silos across the country. In parallel, with increased production of domestic farm output, the dependence on imports will be reduced. We have set up a Food Investment Holding Company as well as other companies that will invest in projects aimed at promoting self-sufficiency and food security for Oman, in partnership with strategic investors from and outside of Oman. The focus will initially be on dairy, the processing of fruit, vegetables, and poultry and meat for increased shelf life as well as value addition for exports. We work closely with other departments in continuously monitoring the market prices to protect the consumers' best interests. Our current levels of inflation are one of the lowest in the region. This gives us the confidence that we will be able to rein in the price spikes.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries Wealth contributing to a diversified economy in the Sultanate of Oman?<br></h4><p>The Omani economy is passing through the diversifying process by focusing on other renewable resources. In the next five-year plan, the government will include fisheries and mining along with tourism, oil, and logistics. One of the components of Oman's diversified economy is fisheries, which includes both sea fishing and aquaculture. We feel that we should utilize the opportunities and optimize production from the seas and also accelerate the growth of aquaculture by expanding production. Of course, this will, by extension, contribute to food security and provide a healthy protein source to the nation, and further afield, as we export 50% of our production. We are the largest market in the GCC, and Europe is also a key export destination.</p><h4>The development strategy adopted by the Ministry is supported by a budget of $1.3 billion. What will be the main projects executed within the scope of Vision 2020?</h4><p>We are, of course, primarily interested in expanding infrastructure, and work is being done to bring ports in all coastal towns to the required level of readiness for business. By the end of this period we will have around 30 multipurpose fishing ports that will not only serve the fishing sector, but also the tourism and trade sectors. We expect these multipurpose ports to greatly assist the fisheries and tourism enterprises to be developed as there is wide scope for development. In addition to the new ports, we are also modernizing eight fishing ports built 10-20 years ago. We will enlarge them and develop more facilities to receive the fishing and tourism fleet.</p><h4>What will be the impact of aquaculture for the development of fisheries in Oman?</h4><p>We expect to produce around 200,000 tons of fish products by the year 2030, which is the equivalent of our current production from the sea. This means that Oman can double its production over the next 15 or so years from the current 200,000 tons from the sea, although we are aiming by 2030 to have reached close to 500,000 tons of sea-fishery and aquaculture products. Aquaculture will play an instrumental role in boosting production, increasing the income from the seas of Oman, and also creating thousands of jobs for nationals, especially graduates from universities and training schools, and other Omanis. This is the objective we are trying to achieve by promoting this sector. We are basing our plan on the experience of Norway, Chile, Scotland, Turkey and other Mediterranean countries—those are the pioneers in this area. We invite investors from these countries to explore the opportunities in Omani waters. We are building on the experience of others, and that is why we are aggressively promoting the sector in Oman. We also promote our aquaculture and fisheries sector internationally by attending key trade shows in Europe, Asia, and the Americas.</p><h4>Regarding FDI, what are your latest achievements?</h4><p>We started promoting aquaculture early last year. We have received over 30 applications for the aquaculture business, but only permitted 19 schemes with a total value of OMR130 million. This investment is a joint venture between Omani investors and foreign investment from Asia, the US, Europe, South Africa, Australia, and elsewhere. There is a collection of investors and investment coming from different parts of the world. Now, we are gearing up to work with the first four companies to start their construction phase, probably within 2014.</p><h4>What role does technology play in this sector?</h4><p>Our fishermen and people employed in the sector are undergoing training to adopt modern technology to improve the efficiency of fishing gear and vessels, as well as to maximize the output of the aquaculture sector. We have companies in the US transferring state-of-the-art technology to Oman, and we may in fact be the first recipients in the region. Moreover, we want to become a leading player in aquaculture by leveraging every opportunity that our location provides, namely clean seas and suitable locations for aquaculture.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[wheres-the-fish]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How was 2013 for Sea Pride's operations?<br></h4><p>We established a new factory in Sur last year that allowed us to capitalize on the fisheries sector. In 2013, our factories produced almost 10,000 tons of seafood. Our 14% increase was mostly in species with an existing market demand. We keep in close contact with our customers, which helps us to establish new business. For Sea Pride, last year's volume was especially good because some of the previous years were not as productive.</p><h4>What factors make this company one of the main players in this sector?</h4><p>Seafood has always been about quality and product availability. Our smaller operations in the past allowed us to fully commit to our customers. Throughout the years, we have developed a high-quality product. Sea Pride also specializes in standardizing products, and we invest heavily in product development. We are introducing a number of new products from our new factory.</p><h4>You have a new 5,000-sqm facility in Sur. What is the importance of technology at your processing plant?</h4><p>The new factory is one of the most state-of-the-art factories in Oman, as well as the largest. It is outfitted with modern equipment and cutting-edge technology. Our main objective is to introduce our products to new markets, such as the US, Europe, and Russia. A large quantity of our sales are also made to local markets. Each market has different demands. In the US, they permit carbon monoxide treated fish, which are not acceptable in Europe. Having achieved our set targets, we are now developing new products. Within two years, we will be at full production at the new plant. We do not expect much competition in this sector, as we operate the only industrial seafood company of its type in Oman.</p><h4>Along with Ithraa, you have participated in important international fisheries exhibitions. Can you share your strategy to promote your company outside the Sultanate?</h4><p>We used to operate a number of joint partnerships with companies outside of the Sultanate, such as Fresh Fish in Europe. We work with our international customers to ship whatever quantities we get. In the local market, we have our own distribution channels. We also distribute frozen fish to a number of markets. Oman is changing, and attitudes are changing as well. People used to purchase fish at the market, but now they expect a prepared product in their local supermarket. Health and sanitation concerns also drive people to buy packaged fish, rather than from a traditional market. We make sure customers know that our product is higher in quality, and safer. In the past, the bulk of our sales were to Europe, but now China has become Sea Pride's largest market. There is a huge demand for high-quality seafood in China.</p><h4>What are you doing to be recognized as an environmentally friendly company?</h4><p>Oman has a long history of sustainable fishing practices. While we have the necessary certifications, Omani fishing culture is naturally sustainable. We no longer engage in trawling. The Omani fishing industry is concerned about the misuse of natural resources. We also promote sustainability in our processing. The fish are handled with care from the time they are landed on the ship, right up to the factory. We also do not throw out any waste products; instead we produce fish feed from the waste. Our factory is in fact a zero-waste operation.</p><h4>How does your proximity to Muscat International Airport and the main seaports benefit your activities?</h4><p>The development of Muscat airport is something we have been pushing for. The airport lets us deliver a much fresher product, which is logistically challenging, as the cargo has to be transported in under five days. In the airport, the fish is out of our hands, and there is a risk of exposure. Once the new cargo handling facility is completed, we will have many new opportunities for export. This will open up opportunities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize Oman's progress toward reaching its Vision 2020 target of 12 million arrivals in the Sultanate?<br></h4><p>The numbers of passengers traveling through Muscat Airport should reach 12 million per year by 2020. Our optimism is based on a number of factors related to the extensive infrastructure development programs in place, namely, the completion of Phase II of the Integrated Tourism Complexes at The Wave, Al Sifa, and Salalah Beach, in addition to a number of new projects in the various governorates. The launching of the Convention and Exhibition Center in Muscat over the next few years will be another attraction, targeting business visitors, which will also assist the Sultanate in increasing the number of arrivals. Furthermore, the work going on at present in improving and expanding the infrastructure during Khareef Salalah (the monsoon season in the south of the country) will also enhance the chances of achieving our target. We are also banking on the continued political and economic stability of the country, and the hospitality of the local communities toward visitors.</p><h4>How does Oman's approach to Tourism differ from other countries in the GCC area?</h4><p>Our approach to tourism is distinctive within the region because of the differences in tourism potential against assets and resources. Oman is blessed with diversified natural resources and a rich heritage, exemplified by more than 500 forts and castles, and a number of historical mountainous villages. Ultimately, our approach to tourism focuses on these strong and different selling points, and our promotion and marketing strategies are centered around them. The wise utilization of these potential and varied resources will give us an edge in terms of arrivals and extended periods of stay in our country.</p><h4>How is the tourism industry creating sustainable jobs in Oman, especially through SMEs?</h4><p>It is well known that the tourism sector is labor intensive by its nature, presenting vast employment opportunities to the national labor force. And although the employment of Omanis in the different sectors is below the government's ambitions due to a number of factors—mainly the low wages offered by the sector thus far, and the reserved attitudes toward the offered jobs—the number of Omanis in the sector has been steadily rising, albeit at a slow pace. The Ministry has been working on many fronts to enhance Omani employment across different activities. One of these fronts is tourism education and training with relevant institutes to increase the intake and improvement of the courses on offer. The second aspect concentrates on coordination between tourism companies and promoters, to promote additional job opportunities for Omanis. The third front concentrates on creating awareness of the sector, thus resulting in changing the attitudes of Omanis toward employment in the tourism sector. We have recently observed a positive change in attitudes, which needs to be re-enforced and consolidated.</p><h4>How would you characterize the significance of tourism revenues on Oman's diversified economy?</h4><p>The direct contribution of the sector to GDP currently stands at 2.3%, while the direct and indirect contribution is estimated at around 6%. Our plans, based on the objectives of the Vision for Oman's Economy: Oman 2020, call for increasing the share of the sector together with fisheries, oil-based industries, and information technology to lessen the dependence on oil as the main source of income. Taking into consideration the many ongoing large-scale projects, we believe that achieving more diversification of the economy is a logical course of action for the government. Tourism resources, together with the other properties of the Sultanate, will enable us to achieve the diversification objective of the vision within a reasonable time period.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does Omran play in the country's tourism industry?<br></h4><p>We are focusing on two major areas: hospitality and attractions. Hospitality basically means standalone hotels. Then, attractions are the reasons why you would come to Oman beyond the natural scenery, such as its forts and castles. We have completed a couple of hotels this year, including Atana Musandam and Alila Jabal Akhdar. We officially opened the Duqm Crowne Plaza, which was completed in 2013. We are now lining up some new hotels, for which construction will begin in 2H2014. Omran is also studying various mixed-use entertainment facilities, which the country lacks at the moment. We are trying to create tourism attractions without overdeveloping the country and ruining the main reason people come here in the first place, which is the country's natural attributes.</p><h4>How is Omran promoting Oman's international brand as an attractive and competitive MICE destination?</h4><p>This is a new area for us. Because of the lack of suitable venues in the past, all we could do was have hotel-based events, which restricts the size of events. Hotels can have 500 to 600 people, but cannot go beyond 1,000. Our convention center project is placing us in a totally different league. Marketing for MICE is not the same as for leisure. With MICE you need to target specific associations or specific groups, as there are only a handful of people who decide if 2,000, for example, doctors will come to Oman or go to Turkey, China, or elsewhere. It is more focused and requires extra effort. We are competing with established and better-known destinations. We have exhibitions lined up, as well as a few large associations, which is a bonus for us.</p><h4>The government is investing $6 billion in increasing capacities at international airports in Salalah and Muscat. How does this investment benefit the tourism sector?</h4><p>Oman is investing in Oman Air, which is now flying to all the major gateway cities. The airport will be ready in time for our events, which takes us into the professional league, as we currently have capacity issues in that respect. We are talking to the government regarding establishing a convention and visitors bureau because that is a request we get all the time. We have prepared a proposal that has been sent to the Cabinet, and we are hoping to receive approval. The exhibition halls and the first phases of the airport will be ready by 2015. From 2016 onward, we will be ready for business. We are looking at exhibitions at the end of 2015, but 2016 is when the machine will really have started working.</p><h4>How are you protecting and preserving Oman's traditional culture and heritage?</h4><p>People come to Oman because it is different. From a heritage point of view, we have set up a company that is looking at abandoned villages, existing forts and castles, and so on. We can actually make the experience of visiting a fort meaningful in terms of the facilities being offered, the guide, and the booklets. In terms of the environment, we decided early on to be pioneers of green buildings in Oman; not because it is required, but because we believe it is the right thing for the country. All of our new hotels and convention centers were built to LEED standards.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-future-is-here]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the vision behind Muriya?<br></h4><p>Oman is considered the second biggest market, after Egypt, in terms of project size and number for Orascom Development Holding. Muriya's chairman understood the potential of the tourism industry when he first came to Oman; this is why Muriya is developing four projects here. Muriya was established in 2006, and the first project began at the end of 2007, with construction commencing in mid-2008. Our four projects in Oman are: Jebel Sifah, 45 minutes from Muscat; Salalah Beach, which is 15 minutes from  Salalah airport; As Sodah Island, off the south coast of Oman; and the last project will be “City Walk," in the heart of Muscat. In total, Muriya is developing more than 20 million sqm. Salalah Beach alone is 15.6 million sqm, and Jebel Sifah is 6.2 million sqm in size. The company's strategy is to build integrated towns. Muriya is not a hotel or gated-community developer. We develop towns. For example, our flagship project in Egypt, El Gouna, has 17 hotels, schools, universities, and 30,000 permanent residents. This is the vision for Oman, as well. In the last three years, we have opened three hotels at Jebel Sifah and Salalah Beach. No other developers in Oman have managed to do this, but this is just the first step. In the future, Muriya will have thousands of real estate properties. Also, unlike other Omani developers, Muriya is more focused on the tourism part. The company believes the future of tourism in the region is in Oman. The level and diversity of attractions in the country is unlike any other place in the Middle East. Oman has abundant natural assets, including more than 2,000 kilometers of coastline, mountains, safari, diving, fishing, and, its gem, Salalah. One day, we want these destinations to be on the international tourism map. Muriya will be the first to develop this area—it is the pioneer.</p><h4>How is the international community receiving your projects, specifically the Salalah Beach project?</h4><p>The first boutique hotel “Juweira" was opened at Salalah Beach in 2012, which initially only had 64 rooms. However, because of the high demand, it now has 82 rooms. In March 2013, Muriya opened the largest stand-alone hotel in Oman, with 400 rooms in total. This property is also Muriya's first five-star property. We are taking advantage of the fact that the new international airport in Salalah will open soon, because one cannot have sustainable tourism without proper infrastructure. Five years ago, there were only five flights per day from Muscat. Now, Qatar Airlines is flying directly from Doha. There is also a service from Air Arabia, Fly Dubai, and two charters from Scandinavia and Germany. Salalah Beach is an attractive destination between July and September for GCC guests. The rest of the year, a large number of people come from German, and there are Swedish charter tours to Salalah. When the new airport opens, there will be more traffic from Europe.</p><h4>The Chairman of Orascom announced his intention to acquire stakes in two leading German tour operators, Raiffeisen Touristik Group GmbH (RT) and FTI Touristik GmbH (FTI). How will this benefit your activities?</h4><p>It will help Muriya significantly. FTI is considered the third biggest tourism company in Germany. Muriya's chairman has a number of shares in this company. FTI has millions of clients per year, and this new decision to focus on tourism will help promote Muriya's work to a German audience. One of the charters already coming from Germany is from FTI. Moreover, we took part in an important international exhibition at the ITB Berlin. This is proof that Muriya is the biggest developer in the country. Usually, during international exhibitions, all Omani businesses go under one group with Oman's Ministry of Tourism, but in 2014 Muriya participated independently, with its own booth.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why did the Sultanate of Oman use Oman Sail as a means of representing and promoting the country?<br></h4><p>There are two primary reasons, the first of which is very relevant to the country; the Sultanate of Oman has a deep maritime history and one of the desires of the country is to reinstate that legacy. During the ISAF Rolex World Sailor of the Year Awards, His Majesty King Constantine of Greece commented on Oman saying, “It is lovely to see a country with such a deep maritime history reinstate it in such a short space of time." Oman Sail is rekindling Oman's maritime heritage and flying Oman's flag internationally at the most well-known sailing events in the world. Sailing attracts international followers who comprise the upper-segment of the socio-economic sphere. For example, 90% of the EU's sailing population comes from the demographic containing doctors, CEOs, company directors, entrepreneurs, and the like. Oman is targeting this tourism sector; it is seeking sports tourists and the more discerning travelers. Oman Sail's participation in prestigious international events such as the Extreme Sailing Series and MOD70 circuit provides the perfect platform to communicate with this target in the countries that have been identified as high priority by the Ministry of Tourism.</p><h4>How is Oman Sail supporting the Sultanate's ambitious tourism objectives?</h4><p>We are supporting them in a number of ways; on the promotional side we are obviously reinforcing their tourism goals. We attend and participate in very high-end events, with the objective of promoting tourism. We also either host or design events in country, for example, the Laser World Championships, which we held last year. That event brought 1,000 people into the country, with a high proportion of them flying Oman Air. They then stayed in Omani hotels, ate here, and purchased other goods and services, such as car rentals. Such events, therefore, have a substantial positive impact on the Omani economy. Thirdly, we offer sailing services; we help tourists with chartering boats and learning how to sail.</p><h4>What is the best way to develop a sailing culture?</h4><p>Sailing is a fun sport and the best way to get people involved in it is to teach them about its benefits and allow them to try it out. We believe that the best way to develop a sailing culture is to raise awareness of the sport. We do this by organizing regular events at the most popular beaches in Oman, where people can try sailing for free with our trained sailing instructors. We also use our sailors as role models for the youth and organize visits to schools around Muscat where they can speak to students about their experiences in sailing and what they gained from engaging in the sport.</p><h4>What are the advantages of having a school at The Wave in Muscat?</h4><p>This is one of four such schools. We have plans to have eight schools up and running by 2020. The advantage of having a school at The Wave is that it benefits locals, while also being in close proximity to the city of Muscat. What we find is that the schools all lean in different directions; Mussanah is more about events and team building, providing corporate leadership and development courses. Our school at The Wave, Muscat is more commercial. At Marina Bandar Al Rowdha, we direct programs geared at youth sailing, while Sur, which has just opened, is therefore malleable, and may take one of several directions.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the Public Authority for Stores and Food Reserve (PASFR) developed since its establishment?<br></h4><p>This organization was established in 1980 with the aim of ensuring a sufficient national stock of food and essential commodities in the event of emergencies. There are seven primary commodities: rice, sugar, wheat, dried milk, vegetable oil, tea, and lentils. They are mainly imported commodities, and as a result part of our strategy for food security is to keep them in stock. The mechanism for doing this has two functions, the first involving the importation of these commodities directly from the sources of production, such as rice from India, Pakistan, or Thailand, whereupon the authority sells directly to the market. This is the case for rice, sugar, and lentils. For other commodities, we deal with the private sector, and we have a contract with companies whereby they stock these commodities to a certain level and sell them on behalf of the organization. Another part of the mandate stipulates proximity to the population. We are, therefore, located at five sites nationwide, namely Sohar, Salalah, Nizwa, Muscat, and most recently Sharqiya. There, we have large warehousing facilities from which we sell to wholesalers. In addition to this, we network with traders and have over 250 agents across Oman that buy from us and resell to the end-consumer.</p><h4>Is it hard to keep food prices stable?</h4><p>It is, but we viewed it as an integral part of our new food security strategy in 2012, of which imports are a component. However, other strategies include increasing local food production, such as beans, red meat, poultry, and dairy. This goal prompted the government to establish the Oman Food Investment Holding Company, of which I am the Chairman, in light of the food crisis of 2008-2009. Another part of this mandate is overseas investment in the products we import, whereby we can secure reliable imports to Oman, too.</p><h4>What role do livestock and fish play in the Sultanate's food supply?</h4><p>Oman is virtually self sufficient in fish production. The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries Wealth is working and has already approved a huge investment to increase local production. There is a focus today on aquaculture, and that  reflects demand, with new companies being licensed in the sector. Other related programs include port infrastructure, with Duqm expected to house vast fisheries and processing units in the coming years. The bulk of that output is consumed domestically, with the balance being exported. In terms of livestock, there is a shortage of both production and green feed. Oman imports significant volumes of livestock, and yet around 80% of this is destined for re-export. There is a current government drive—channeled through our company and other organizations—to increase local production, either through farms in Oman, imports, or by working abroad directly and importing processed food. The Oman Food Investment Holding Company is working on a project related to boosting livestock in Oman, and that should have a framework in place by 2015. There is a huge gap between local production and consumption in terms of livestock.</p><h4>What is the significance of the government's wheat silo construction project with TAME?</h4><p>Our organization holds responsibility for that project, which involves the construction of silos in Sohar and Salalah with a grain capacity of 200,000 tons in Sohar. There will also be silos at Salalah Port with a capacity of around 100,000 tons, making for a total capacity of approximately 300,000 tons, mostly of wheat. As part of our strategy we are evaluating the possibility of Oman becoming a hub for grain commerce, and a number of countries consider this to be a viable proposition given that Oman is centrally located between Asia, Africa, and Europe, with convenient proximity on the Indian Ocean.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you rate the current healthcare system in Oman?<br></h4><p>The Sultanate of Oman has made remarkable achievements in health developments over the past four decades. These health achievements have been praised by a number of international organizations. The UNICEF, in its Progress of Nations 1993 report, ranked Oman first in the MENA and second globally in regard to the percentage reduction of the under-five mortality rate. The same report also ranked Oman first in the MENA region with regard to measles immunization coverage. Oman was among the 12 developing countries that achieved the 2000 year target, set by the World Summit for Children 1990, of at least 90% childhood immunization coverage, long before the target date. The Human Development Report 1997 of the UNDP stated that “Beginning in 1970, Oman undertook a comprehensive program of human development, achieving some of the most rapid advances ever recorded. Life expectancy has increased by 30 years; from 40 years in 1970 to 70 years in 1994. Infant mortality was reduced from more than 200 per 1,000 live births in 1960 to less than 30 in 1994." This report considered Oman as a global pace-setter for human development, especially in the areas of health and education. A study commissioned by the government of Oman, UNICEF, and the World Health Organization (WHO) on health achievements in Oman reported that Oman's decline in childhood mortality is one of the fastest recorded in the world. The health system in Oman is judged to respond to peoples' needs, whether health or non-health related. The Oman World Health Survey, conducted in 2008, showed that about three-quarters of surveyed people needed some sort of healthcare during the three years preceding the survey, and that 98.4% received the care they needed; only 1.6% did not receive care. The survey also showed that the health system was responsive to their overall non-health needs, with an average score of about 76% for inpatient services and slightly more than 77% for outpatient services. The results clearly show that the people are satisfied with how healthcare providers treat them as well as with the quality of health service amenities.</p><h4>How is the Ministry working to develop healthcare infrastructure in the country?</h4><p>Healthcare infrastructure has shown remarkable growth since the early days in 1970. From only two small hospitals with only 12 beds and 19 clinics distributed across the country in 1970, today, after 43 years by the end of 2013, Oman had a total of 66 hospitals; 49 run by the Ministry of Health, five by other public healthcare providers, and 12 by the private sector, with a total of 6,178 hospital beds. There is now one hospital bed to serve about 624 members of the population, compared with about 50,000 in the early 1970s. The Ministry of Health is now running 195 health centers, all providing high-quality primary healthcare. In addition, there are 50 clinics owned by other public healthcare providers and 1,026 private clinics providing basic medical care. There are also incentives for the private sector.</p><h4>What emphasis are you placing on finding well-educated local medical professionals?</h4><p>Medical education commenced in Oman in 1986 with the establishment of the College of Medicine and Health Sciences at Sultan Qaboos University (SQU) in Muscat. Prior to that, Omani students had to travel abroad in order to pursue medical degrees. The College of Medicine and Health Sciences at SQU enrolled its first batch of 45 students for the MD program in 1986, and graduated a total of 1,676 medical graduates between 1993 and 2012. The MD degree from SQU is accredited by the General Medical Council of the UK. There are a total of 658 students studying specialties related to healthcare abroad. SQU has also contributed to the graduation of a number of paramedical personnel. In addition to Oman Medical College (OMC), another private university, the University of Nizwa (UON) was established in 2004/2005 and offers undergraduate programs for pharmacy and nursing. These educational institutes have graduated a total of 1,940 physicians, 47 dentists, 407 pharmacists, 342 nurses, and 94 medical laboratory specialists.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the healthcare industry in Oman?<br></h4><p>The Oman healthcare sector can be divided into three basic components: hardcore pharmaceuticals, medical care (hospitals),  diagnostics, and physiotherapy. Oman has excellent healthcare facilities and has been advancing rapidly in this sector. His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said, has a great vision of self-sufficiency in healthcare, education, and infrastructure. The private sector is also now becoming involved in the sector, meaning it is on a very solid path to progress.</p><h4>What were the highlights for Ibn Sina Pharmacy over the past few years?</h4><p>We have a well-balanced portfolio with regard to healthcare. We have a network of 15 retail pharmacies across Oman and have the distinction of being the only private retail chain pharmacy in large up-and-coming towns in the micro-interiors of the country, such as Duqm, Mahout, Haima, Thumrait, and Adam. The government provides pharmaceutical healthcare to these regions, but we are also excited to offer our services to the people of the Sultanate who live in these interior regions and cities.</p><p>Earning the reputation of a reliable supplier of healthcare products and services has been a significant highlight over the years. ISO certification by BVQI, recognition as an Oman Superbrand, and the recognition of the Ministry of Health are testament to our commitment to deliver quality. We are a major supplier of both finished pharmaceutical products and also non-pharmaceutical products, such as medical equipment, surgical disposables, and diagnostics equipment. Overall, 2014 has been a good year, with our business pace seemingly ahead of the market growth.</p><h4>What are your advantages vis-í -vis the competition?</h4><p>The healthcare industry falls into a particular range of services that essentially are not that different in terms of the types of services being provided. After all, the products we all sell are approved by the Ministry of Health, meaning that nobody can claim that their products are better than those of another. That being said, Ibn Sina Pharmacy is always seen to be a fair, serious, genuine player with excellent logistical support, both to the government and the private sector. I think what distinguishes us is our excellent logistics capabilities. We also manage our business well in terms of human resources, software, finances, and management practices.</p><h4>What effects does the recent price-harmonization regulation in the GCC have on your business and the sector overall?</h4><p>We have long been monitoring the progress of the healthcare sector and market in the GCC, and are fully in sync with the region. As an example, the Council of GCC Health Ministers had already taken a decision to standardize the price of medicines throughout the region. We have a period of three months in which to implement the new regulations. The lowest prices are in Saudi Arabia, and may eventually impact our own sales volume, but time will tell.</p><h4>Which hospitals do you work with?</h4><p>There has been an explosion of hospitals in the country over the past decade, both government and private. The largest and the first of its kind as a large institution providing excellent healthcare facilities and services was the Royal Hospital. Then, came the Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, which is also an excellent facility. And then we have the Ministry of Defense hospitals, which provide fantastic healthcare to patients nationwide. The Ministry of Diwan has also opened a huge center. Private hospitals have also developed well in recent years, building up specializations and offering excellent health services in fields such as cardiology, obstetrics, and pediatrics, for example. And this is not just the case in the large coastal cities, but also in the major interior cities and areas of the country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-right-moves]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the Ministry guiding and fostering the development of the higher education sector in the Sultanate of Oman?<br></h4><p>The Ministry of Higher Education is responsible for Oman's Private Universities and Colleges as well as the Colleges of Applied Sciences. Other Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) are under the jurisdiction of other ministries or agencies. In the enactment of its role, the Ministry of Higher Education takes a planned approach. The Ministry has played a leading role in developing the National Strategy for Education 2040, an umbrella plan under the aegis of the Council of Education, which contains a series of well-researched recommendations for the coordinated and effective education of students from early childhood education to graduate studies. The overall goal of the Strategic Plan is to help ensure that the Sultanate is able to develop a competitive niche in the global economy. An important element in this plan is the rationalization and coordination of governance systems for education in the interests of better preparing all students with the skills necessary for success in the knowledge economy of today's globalized world. The implementation of this recommendation would include the consolidation of responsibility for degree education, improved collaboration between the Ministries of Education and Higher Education, and more emphasis on the importance of vocational education through the Colleges of Applied Sciences and the Colleges of Technology, which are under the aegis of the Ministry of Manpower—all of which is expected to increase the efficiency and output of the overall system of education. The government's system of awarding scholarships based on merit for Omani students to study abroad plays an important role in preparing students for the global market as well as in acquiring degrees in specialized fields. Today, more than 4,000 scholarship students are studying at reputable universities abroad. The undergraduate scholarship program, which commenced in 2001, offers 1,500 scholarships annually to meritorious secondary school graduates. The Ministry emphasizes diversification in receiving countries so that students benefit from varied systems of higher education. The scholarship program includes 1,000 scholarships for graduate studies in areas that are vital for Oman's economic development.</p><h4>What role does the private sector play in higher education in the Sultanate?</h4><p>The support of the private sector was crucial to the expansion of the higher education system, which grew from one private college in 1995 to the present system of seven private universities and 19 private colleges. With incentives from the government that include land endowments, tax exemptions, matching grants, and, in the case of qualifying private universities, an OMR17 million grant for quality improvement directly related to the classroom, private investors from Oman and abroad have taken responsibility for funding Oman's private higher education institutes.</p><h4>What main trends have you noted in the higher education field in Oman?</h4><p>The number of students enrolled in higher education in the Sultanate has grown rapidly over the past 14 years, and is now around 100,000 students. In 2014, the number of the new entrants to Oman's higher education institutes totaled about 30,000 students or approximately 89% of qualified secondary school leavers. While expansion of the system and access are not issues since the current and planned seat capacity will meet market demand with respect to qualified students, improving quality will continue to be an important thrust throughout the system. Diversification of program offerings within and among institutions is an important trend that is also continuing, particularly with the plan for a government university of science and technology and the aim of the planned University of Muscat to make entrepreneurism and job-orientation strong priorities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What changes is the education sector in Oman seeing?<br></h4><p>The education sector has evolved quite significantly over the past 40 to 45 years. Though it has been a gradual lap toward success, the country has achieved its goal of creating a firm and secure educational background that cannot be impaired in any way due to the complex process in which it was developed. This is because our mission was to initiate a sound and effective education system through embedding activities with practical and innovative ideas along with supportive learning environment that define success for students and train them to think as individuals and to develop missionary goals, which will evolve into the creation of a more advanced ability of understanding the mindful creation of new ideas, which will no doubt raise the number of geniuses. They will definitely contribute successfully and enormously to the development of the education system in Oman, and predominantly SQU. In this sense, the university has thoroughly conducted many seminars and symposiums that aim at honing students' skills, particularly practical and educational ones, and is currently working to hold a symposium in October 2014 by the Secretariat General of the Education Council of Oman, where the Council will present the vision for the education sectors and bring about further developmental concepts for the future of our education.</p><h4>How would you characterize access to higher education in Oman?</h4><p>Private education relies comprehensively on the government. In effect, the Ministry of Higher Education distributes all the graduates after considering their degrees and grades within the colleges in the region. Accordingly, this in itself confirms a cooperative connection between the private and public sectors. To date, SQU has been ranked as one of the top priorities in the selection of places where high school graduates intend to enroll for their studies; more than 3,000 students annually are admitted at SQU. The Ministry of Higher Education sends about 1,000 students abroad for the same reason and SQU hosts 200-300 international students a year, all of who get to experience different cultures. And that, by itself, provides an opportunity to them to expand their fields of view, make them more open to new knowledge and expertise, as well as expose them to different languages.</p><h4>What milestones has SQU achieved in recent years?</h4><p>We have had over 40,000 graduates in different majors, from the College of Engineering, Medicine and Health Science, Science, Education, Agriculture and Marine Sciences, Arts and Social Sciences, Nursing, Law and Economicsl and Political Science, since the inception of the university. The university has expanded significantly since it was established and today accommodates around 17,000 students.</p><h4>In which research areas is the university contributing to the advancement of science?</h4><p>SQU spares no effort to adopt measures to develop a strong research base that would effectively support the educational process, contribute to the Sultanate's social and economic growth, and add to global knowledge. SQU has witnessed a steady increase in the number of publications produced. For example, the number of journal publications has dramatically increased to about 145% as it was 419 in 2000 and increased to 1,027 in 2011. In terms of conference publications, the number has risen by 136% from 253 to 598 over the same period. Additionally, in 2012 the number of papers published per faculty member per year was 1.1, which rises to 1.7 when considering conference publications. Furthermore, a total of 394 books were published by SQU faculty members between 2000 and 2012. The main areas of interest are Medicine followed by Science and Engineering and Agriculture and Marine Sciences. Besides that, we have some specific areas related to Remote Sensing, Geographic Information Systems, Omani Studies, Environmental Studies, Oil &amp; Gas, Biotechnology, and Humanities, which have always been in our focus. The university also tries to address domestic issues, such as enhanced oil recovery (EOR). Other than that, we have also started focusing on autism, which has publicized the social impact and gained major interest and popularity in the community.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[sage-advice]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us a brief overview of Deloitte's evolution since its inception here in the Sultanate of Oman?<br></h4><p>Deloitte has been in the Middle East for the last 87 years, and in 2004 we officially registered the Deloitte name in the Sultanate of Oman. It has been a successful journey since then to the point where we have won the most prestigious audits in the Sultanate in sectors such as oil and gas, energy and utilities, financial services, and hospitality. We have also assisted with several advisory engagements in the oil and gas industry, as well as the electricity, water, and financial services sectors.</p><h4>What is the importance of the Sultanate within Deloitte's operations in the GCC?</h4><p>Oman is an important market and part of the GCC countries that pay particular attention to development and tend to work closely with different government institutions for the development of the local economy. Deloitte is a fully integrated practice in the Middle East, by which we mean that all the offices work closely together. As a result, we have many specialists from other offices assisting us in our complex advisory work. It is not just the Omani office supporting the Omani community; when necessary, we do bring in specialists from other offices.</p><h4>What is your competitive advantage?</h4><p>Our development of Omani staff, together with our adherence to best practice in Oman, and our close relationship with the Capital Market Authority (CMA), ensure that there is proper corporate governance within Oman. In addition, we work very closely with the Central Bank of Oman and other regulators to ensure that best practices are adhered to.</p><h4>How has corporate governance improved in the country?</h4><p>Corporate governance in Oman is strong. Oman has been the leader in the establishment of robust corporate governance regulations when compared to other countries in the region. Furthermore, the government takes adherence to corporate governance very seriously.</p><h4>What is the main challenge here in the Sultanate?</h4><p>It is in-country value (ICV). When we came here, we were advocates for this and made sure that the ICV principles were adhered to by many operating oil companies. Encouraging Omanis to join the industry, whether in auditing, advisory roles, consulting, or tax, is critical to the successful growth of the profession in Oman.</p><h4>Are Omanis predominantly prepared for the job or do you train them?</h4><p>We need to provide them with training. Then, it is always a challenge to retain them. There have been significant steps taken to improve SMEs and entrepreneurship within Oman. At our conference in 2013, our key focus was on SMEs and how we as an advisory firm could help. The government is well aware of the CMA initiative to promote SMEs, but it will take some time. Omanization is a challenge, for example finding sufficient numbers of qualified Omani accountants in the market is an issue. We take university graduates and train them before they qualify as accountants. The Omanization target for professional services firms is set fairly high and we are expected to develop our Omani staff very quickly. I would say that more than Omanization, you have to make sure that the financial institutions are ready to support and finance SMEs. If an SME is launched, it is a challenge for them to go to the bank and ask them for finance. The banks would not like to take the risk. The government of Oman is establishing several funds to assist, but it will still be a challenge to make sure that SMEs are adequately financed. The other key concept is to ensure they have the correct entrepreneurship coaching, which is a subject that is becoming popular worldwide. You need to teach many of these SMEs how to become proper entrepreneurs and to run their businesses efficiently.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the unique qualities of The Wave project?<br></h4><p>The Wave is not only unique in Oman, but in the region. We have a spectacular six kilometer beachfront location within 10 minutes of the international airport and integrated safe, landscaped residential areas with lifestyle amenities such as a Greg Norman-designed signature PGA championship golf course for day and night golf, a world-class award winning marina, convenience retail, a community beach, and restaurant and café precincts. This combination makes The Wave one of the most sought-after residential communities in the region with over 60 different nationalities already calling The Wave home. People are attracted to the convenience and sense of community and belonging that the integration brings, and many people have brought their extended families from around the region to come and live here as well.</p><h4>Who are the key targets for The Wave?</h4><p>The Wave has several components that make it attractive. In terms of residents, Omanis make up about 20% of permanent residents, a figure that is growing each year and represents about 40% of all of our buyers. The balance of buyers are long-term expatriates who live and work in Oman as well as international investors wanting to enjoy the residency offered through the Royal Decreed Integrated Tourism Complex (ITC) freehold ownership scheme, as well as the investment opportunity of owning property at The Wave. The strong demand for the project locally and regionally is evidence of the strong success of the ITC concept in Oman to attract foreign investment into the residential sector. As the project matures and Oman's economy continues to grow there will be increased demand for quality residential property from the regional market as well as international investors. We have only completed around 30% of the residential components of the project and the best is yet to come.</p><h4>How would you assess The Wave's potential to develop alternative commercial opportunities?</h4><p>The Wave is a platform for many opportunities, not just commercial. For example, Oman Sail, a separate company, has its headquarters at The Wave marina and through its sailing schools is developing young Omani sailors and creating employment opportunities for Omanis in marina and maritime industries. We plan to attract more such businesses, and in early 2015 will launch an office park. We are already receiving requests from companies hoping to establish a presence within The Wave and be part of its success.</p><h4>In your experience, what are the main challenges in the market?</h4><p>In this market, as in others, when dealing with projects of this size the regulatory environment is always evolving. We are in partnership with the government, both at the project level with the government as a 50% joint venture partner, and also at the administrative and regulatory level, where we are part of the catalyst to help establish a regulatory framework. Fortunately, The Wave enjoys a good working relationship with the government and is benchmarking not only for the country, but for other countries within the region as well.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The development strategy adopted by the Ministry of Agriculture is supported by a significant budget of about OMR3 billion. How will the company benefit from this investment?<br></h4><p>I believe the benefits from this investment will be to the sector as a whole and not just to Oman Fisheries. Our company has been working on a five-year strategic plan wherein one of the objectives is to develop local fishermen. Before the implementation of this plan, we had no fishermen working for us; we just sold the rights to foreign vessels. Today, we are working with  more than 400 fishermen who are exclusively fishing for us in return we supply them with all the necessary equipment and training they need to fish. This ranges from subsidizing them with soft loans so that they can upgrade their fishing boats to training them in how to maintain the quality of the fish. We also support them during the off-season by giving them advances.</p><h4>On your website, you claim to be the largest fishing company in Oman. What factors are supporting your growth?</h4><p>First of all, the development of our company depends on our fisheries resource—the availability of the fish makes our goals easier to achieve. We have been facing a number of challenges in Oman, which is why we decided to move overseas as well. We currently have two factories in Yemen, and one in Bahrain. Recently, we began working in Pakistan, India, and Vietnam too. We hope to see five things happen in the sector. The first is for the government to have one research vessel, which will help update us on the biomass in the sea. Right now, we do not know exactly how we are endangering our fishing stocks. The government also needs to produce a publication, either quarterly or bi-annually, to present the results of this monitoring to fisheries stakeholders. Secondly, the fishing fleet of Oman needs to be upgraded. The private sector is more involved in R&amp;D, but its members are usually risk averse and prefer to utilize what is already available. Thirdly, we require clearer guidelines on the permitted fishing gear in the waters of Oman. We supported the decision to ban trawling in Oman, and there are other fishing methods I am also against. The fourth improvement I would like to see concerns the fishermen. There are almost 40,000 registered fishermen in the country; however, they are not all full-time. If we take the example of some larger countries—such as Japan, Korea, and Spain—that are famous for their fishing, you will see that only the captain, skipper, and engineer are locals. Most of the crew will be from the Far East. Therefore, changes in concerned laws to allow easy access to labor force would be helpful. The fifth factor relates to infrastructure distribution. Southern Oman is one of the richest areas for fishing, yet there are only three ports. By comparison, there are we have more than 12 ports in the north of the country.  The north of the country is more populated; hence, the number of registered fishermen is also higher. This may be why the distribution of infrastructure is off.</p><h4>What are you doing to build your image internationally?</h4><p>We have been working to build our image by providing quality products, volume, and a wide variety followed by ethics and transparency. These are the key strengths of Oman Fisheries Company. Oman Fish as a brand signals quality fish from the Gulf. For the sake of building our image internationally, we participate in three exhibitions. We have been attending the European Seafood Exposition for more than 10 years. We are very proud to be the only Arab country to participate in this exhibition. We are getting business, but it zigzags depending on the global economy. When the Far East is strong, more business goes there and when Europe is strong, we change our focus there. However, the international economy plays a role in deciding the target markets and we follow the economic changes to adopt our marketing focus.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are you doing to promote the Oman brand internationally?<br></h4><p>The Ministry of Tourism's marketing strategy aims to promote Oman internationally as a quality destination for responsible tourists and, in doing so, to spread tourism's benefits throughout the Sultanate of Oman. The Ministry's portfolio of marketing activities adds wide-ranging government programs that showcase Oman as a preferred location for business, trade, tourism, and living. Our call to action is used to convey the message: there are moments in Oman that make you realize that beauty has an address. This includes tangible and intangible visitor experiences surrounded by world-class scenery.</p><h4>What are you doing to promote expanded options in the tourism sector?</h4><p>The Ministry has opened 10 market-based representatives in major European cities, as well as in Australia, India, and the UAE, which cater to countries in the GCC region. These offices are intensifying their marketing and promotion efforts to attract more tourists from their respective markets. Moreover, the Ministry is joining forces with Oman Air to promote and market Oman as a unique destination. More efforts are underway to upgrade and intensify the utilization of the Ministry's website.</p><h4>How would you assess Oman's progress regarding its Vision 2020 goal of 12 million arrivals?</h4><p>Tourism in the Sultanate is at the center of these ambitions, with an ultimate objective of attracting 12 million tourists in 2020. Statistics show that there was a 6% increase in the number of tourists in 2013 compared to 2012. About 2.18 million visited the Sultanate in 2013, up from 2 million tourists in 2012. These statistics are not yet final, and could well rise. A large number of projects are being laid out, including the development of the country's two major airports in Muscat and Salalah, the construction of new airports, and a general improvement of transportation infrastructure in the country. The Port of Muscat is also being developed to attract more cruise passengers.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on how the government's infrastructure investment will impact the tourism industry?</h4><p>The unique selling point of Oman's tourism remains its beautiful landscape, ecology, and heritage. The government is doing a good job in turning things around in the tourism sector. By significantly investing in its national carrier, Oman Air, and funding airport development, the government has already driven up tourism inflows into Oman. Simultaneously, Muscat International Airport has been transformed into a regional and international travel hub. Oman Air has been expanding its network to potential source markets. With higher handling capacity at airports and seaports, as is envisaged in the eighth plan, Oman will continue to attract more international flights and cruise ships leading to strong travel and tourism sector growth. Furthermore, the development of additional domestic airports and seaports will improve accessibility to interior locations, which will unleash a slew of yet-untapped tourism opportunities. These range from large multi-zone, multi-use urban developments like The Wave Muscat and the Muriya project in Salalah, to fast track clearances for hotels and tourism attraction areas. This additional capacity will lead to increased tourism promotion and arrivals.</p><h4>How do you expect your operations to evolve in the future?</h4><p>We are developing a new tourism strategy with an external agency, which specializes in tourism. This new strategy will focus on increasing the contributions of the tourism sector to the GDP of the country. A Spanish think tank has been engaged to study tourism strategy in Oman. The company has started its preliminary work, and the team is currently visiting the governorates of the Sultanate to examine tourist sites and identify potential tourism products. This is part of the formation of a comprehensive understanding of the quantitative and qualitative nature of Oman's tourism sector. This project is expected to last anywhere from a year, to a year and a half, in order to be implemented according to requirements.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess Oman's progress in the healthcare sector?<br></h4><p>In a study covering 191 countries in 2000, the World Health Organization (WHO) ranked Oman as first in the world for its highly efficient health system and for the effective and competent utilization of the available financial resources in health services. Oman was also rated eighth for providing the most comprehensive healthcare at a global level. Approximately 14 years since then, I think that we have not only maintained the high quality of our healthcare services, but we have consolidated our successes even further. To further build on our strengths and address any deficiencies, the Ministry of Health conducted an international conference on Health Vision 2050 in May 2012, followed by a series of workshops to develop a national, integrated health policy and set out clear action plans and targets to be accomplished in the coming years. We are proud of the progress made by the Ministry of Health during the reign of His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said and can say with confidence that the citizens of this country are fortunate to enjoy healthcare services of a high standard, free of charge, and something that even highly developed countries can only dream of.</p><h4>What is the Royal Hospital's role in the Sultanate's medical environment?</h4><p>The Royal Hospital, established in December 1987, is the country's apex referral center with regard to the specialties and sub-specialties of medicine, surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, oncology, anesthesia and critical care, radiology, nuclear medicine, laboratory medicine, and pathology. It complements other Ministry of Health tertiary-care hospitals, namely Khoula Hospital, Al Nahdha Hospital, and Al Masarra Hospital. It also works closely with the Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, the Armed Forces Hospital, and the Royal Oman Police Hospital. The Royal Hospital's mission is to improve the health of the people it serves and manage illness by providing tertiary-level, state-of-the-art healthcare with maximum efficiency, effectiveness, patient satisfaction, and safety. Being the leading referral center for the country, the Royal Hospital plays a leadership role with respect to its specialties and sub-specialties. The consultants of the Royal Hospital are thus actively involved in all Ministry of Health programs for non-communicable diseases and infection control. The Royal Hospital is also a teaching hospital for the undergraduate programs of the Sultan Qaboos University College of Medicine, the residency program of the Oman Medical Specialty Board, and the nursing and paramedical programs run by various Ministry of Health training institutes.</p><h4>How are you solving the problem of a shortage of qualified local medical professionals?</h4><p>All directors and heads of service at the Royal Hospital are Omanis. Approximately 60% of the 185 senior doctors are Omani, all of whom have returned after advanced specialization in the UK, Ireland, the US, Canada, Australia, and other countries. Since most Omani junior- and middle-level doctors at the Royal Hospital are undergoing graduate training under the Oman Medical Specialty Board, 85% of our 147 specialists, junior specialists, and medical officer posts are filled by expatriates. Around 52% of the 1,487 nurses, 81% of the 112 pharmacists and assistant pharmacists, 65% of the 174 technologists and technicians, and 68% of the 88 other paramedical staff are Omanis. The medical orderlies, and administrative and clerical staff are all Omanis. It is evident that the hospital does not have a major shortage of a qualified local workforce. There are many Omanis undergoing MD training at the College of Medicine of Sultan Qaboos University and at the Oman Medical College. A good number of them will enroll for graduate training conducted by the Oman Medical Specialty Board, and then will invariably go abroad for sub-specialization. Many doctors are also expected back from training abroad. We expect that most medical professionals at Royal Hospital will be Omani in a few years. There are exceptions, however, like pediatric cardiac surgery and pediatric surgery, where Omanis are lacking. What is significant is that the quality of the Omani workforce is very good, and most specialty and sub-specialty services are even now being managed and run by Omanis.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[only-the-finest]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you foresee the development of the halal food industry in Malaysia?</h4><p>Malaysia has always wanted to be a leader in the halal industry in terms of production, certification, and so on. We have been talking about it for the past 15 years. I wouldn't say that we have been successful yet, because we remain a net importer of raw materials and might not be price competitive for some products. We import 85% of our meat and our milk imports are almost at the same amount. Thailand is not even a Muslim country, but it is exporting considerable halal products to the Middle East because materials there are plentiful and cheap, as is the cost of labor. Since we cannot be a major manufacturer of halal food, we should look at the halal management and control system and halal certifications. These can be applicable to other countries. We are trying to do this in China. There are many Muslims in certain regions and provinces of China, and we have joint ventures with local provincial government companies to develop the halal industry. Meanwhile, we are promoting halal produce to the Chinese in the context of food security issues. Even non-Muslim Chinese will want to consume these products as “halal" has been translated into Mandarin as “good and clean." We are trying to use these regions as a gateway into the rest of China. This is the halal management control system that we call Fidelity Assurance in Halal Integrity Management (FAHIM). This is a system that we worked on together with IBM Australia. We are now looking at places to host it.</p><h4>To what extent are you catering to the airline industry?</h4><p>We cater for the airline industry and food services such as restaurants at the airport and the food franchise business. Across the board, the global airline industry is growing. We signed a new contract with Lufthansa recently, and Air France is also a new customer and had never flown into Kuala Lumpur before. Lufthansa formerly did, and is now effecting a return to the market, while British Airways is in talks with us and could become our client by 1Q2015. Turkish Airlines is also our customer. In fact, more than 90% of airlines that land in Kuala Lumpur are serviced by us. The other notable catering company is relatively small, and its predominant focus is on ground handling. The number of meals provided can approach 100,000 a day and we currently produce about 55,000 of those. More than 230 aircraft a day land in the country around the clock, 365 days a year. Meanwhile, we have been busy sourcing fresh business opportunities, having recently acquired Burger King Singapore and Malaysia, which includes 54 restaurants in Malaysia and 41 in Singapore. I was in Australia recently, too, and we are setting up a halal abattoir in Western Australia in a joint venture with a local company. We are the only Malaysian company with an abattoir in Australia. It makes sense because we import a lot of meat for our businesses. We have to control the meat source. All beef coming into Malaysia must be halal-certified by law. So if we provide for our own needs, we can export as well. We also have to control the supply sources. There are a number of things we are looking at including some M&amp;As.</p><div class="quote">“I am trying to develop the business into becoming one of the largest, if not the largest, halal food companies."</div><h4>Where do you see the company positioning itself in the future?</h4><p>I am trying to develop the business into becoming one of the largest, if not the largest, halal food companies. We are already recognized as being a substantial halal operator. A flight kitchen we have in Kuala Lumpur was once the world's largest, before Dubai surpassed it. Our facilities are substantial, featuring a 50,000 sqm building on 28 acres of land, with sizable capacity remaining for growth.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How are Omani SMEs contributing to the economy of the Sultanate, and how is the Al Raffd Fund supporting them?<br></h4><p>The SME sector represents about 90% of the private sector in Oman, and about 14% of its GDP. We are seeing the potential for slow, but increased growth over the next decade. The Al Raffd Fund will provide financial support to youth to start and improve their businesses. The Fund launched its first financial programs in January 2014; the current four financial programs are: Mawred for those benefiting from social insurance; Tasees for job seekers willing to start their own businesses; Riyada for entrepreneurs, rural women, craftsmen, and business incubator beneficiaries; and Tazeez for those who benefited previously from our programs. We are about to launch our new  identity, as well as financial programs and services to meet the requirements of different SMEs, because we understand that the Fund needs to be structured like a bank. We need to automate more systems here, such as IT being integrated into the Fund and the Public Authority for SME Development (PASMED).</p><h4>Many start-up businesses fail in Oman because of undercapitalization and poor financial resources. What is your offer to support SMEs?</h4><p>We have project managers and fully dedicated teams handling portfolios of different beneficiaries, and their job is to open doors by providing gateways to government entities and contracts. One of the decisions of the SMEs National Symposium, which was held in 2013, was to allocate 10% of government tenders and contracts to local SMEs. Such a decision will have a major and positive impact on the SME sector in Oman. We follow our beneficiaries once they get financing from Al Raffd Fund for three years, checking their progress every three months to ensure their projects are being managed and run in a proper manner. We need to redefine the SME. Today's definition focuses on two elements: number of employees and turnover. Al Raffd Fund believes that there needs to be a foundation first to be successful, because you cannot know your turnover if you do not maintain and keep your business accounts. Today, the only record of companies we have is through their financial statements from their bank accounts.</p><p>Moreover, the government assists SMEs with research, marketing, and branding. PASMED has trained 400 candidates in different fields related to entrepreneurship and SMEs development, including finance, marketing, technical issues, and management. Our training covers challenges faced in the market, such as current competitors, obstacles, and financial management. Everything is done for a new project, with the support of PASMED. Once the applicant is capable to run his or her business, the Al Raffd Fund takes over; different financial program schemes are available. We have $280 million, which will be increased by 10% annually. An entrepreneur simply has to come to our committee and convince them of his or her idea.</p><p>The committee approved 269 candidates in 1Q2014, with each project receiving OMR30,000, on average. The first impact of the fund is to create and promote employment for citizens and young Omanis, because one of the conditions for receiving the funds is for the entrepreneur to be fully employed and dedicated in his or her own enterprise. The second part is that we have a target to increase Oman's GDP by nearly 25% over the next 10 years. As mentioned earlier, one of the outcomes of the symposium was 10% of the tenders values from government contracts should be given to entrepreneurs. This comes out to around OMR180 million for 2014. The worst-case scenario is if we are given OMR500 million, imagine how the economy will grow?</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us about the work that BP has conducted in the Sultanate after winning the exploration contract for Block 61?<br></h4><p>BP signed an agreement in January 2007 for the appraisal and development of Block 61. We then carried out one of BP's largest ever 3D-seismic shoots. It was conducted safely without any safety incidents at all. Then, we did an extensive appraisal program, drilling 11 wells. As part of that appraisal program, we actually developed an extended well test (EWT). We built a facility in the desert that was commissioned in March 2001 and it processes the gas. We produced a small amount of gas that was given to Oman through the grid, but the main purpose of that facility was to get data on the wells and on the flow rates. It also gave us a great understanding of operating in a desert environment in Oman. On December 16, 2013 we signed the $16 billion Khazzan development project for Block 61.</p><h4>What is the importance of the Sultanate within BP's operations in the GCC region?</h4><p>Within BP's portfolio, the Khazzan gas project is one of the biggest unconventional projects. The operations here are a major part of the BP Middle East portfolio. In fact, the Khazzan gas development is one of the biggest portfolios in BP after Shah Deniz in Azerbaijan, and it is the biggest onshore gas project. It is important to BP, and also to Oman, because once we are successful we will produce, on a gas basis, only one-third for domestic consumption.</p><h4>What sort of investment will be required and will it be fully operational in 2017?</h4><p>To date, we have awarded $4 billion worth of contracts. We have already drilled our first development well. That started in January 2014, and we are on to our second development well now. We are building roads, well pads, and other infrastructure. The central processing facility (CPF) has been awarded to Petrofac. BP has one rig drilling at the moment. We are also mobilizing two rigs in Nizwa, and they have come from Central Asia, through the Suez Canal, and then into Oman. They are being assembled now. Both rigs are mobilizing to the field as we speak; moreover, we have got three new rigs on the way. By the end of 2014, we could have six rigs operational. I think the main message is that we are in action.</p><h4>What are the main technical challenges that you are facing?</h4><p>We are going to mobilize between 7,000 and 10,000 people into the field to work on this development. In that respect, safety is probably the biggest technical challenge. Then, it is the very hard rock, meaning that drilling and hard rock stimulation are challenges as well. But basically, we have so much technology and expertise from lots of other parts of the world at BP, especially from North America. We have people from that business here now assisting and helping with that technology and know-how. With our partners, Schlumberger contractors will use their technology as well as our technology as an advantage. The sheer scale of the project is also a challenge, as we are going to drill 300 wells over the next 15 years.</p><h4>How is BP supporting and promoting in-country value (ICV) in the Sultanate?</h4><p>ICV is something that we take seriously. It is not a fad; it is here to stay. I sit on the ICV committee with HE Salim Al Aufi, Undersecretary of Oil and Gas, as do the other oil operators. We are doing many things within our contracts. We have elements of ICV, and we are working on some projects to develop some businesses here in Oman around proper manufacturing, rig construction, and we are also looking at the broader picture of ICV around graduates, which include the colleges and schools delivering across the board from an individual point of view.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[just-a-little-bit-more]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you provide us with a description of Daleel's operations since its inception in 2002?<br></h4><p>Daleel has gone through a tremendous transformation. We started as a small company, producing 4,500 bbl/d, and then embarked on  major studies to understand our reservoirs and gauge the potential reserves volumes in the concession block. That was followed by extensive appraisal drilling and technology trials  with which we could pin down the strategy of our development. Those trials and evaluations were successful and enabled us to implement  water flood in the Shuaiba reservoir in the Daleel field. After that, we worked on expanding the water flood to other areas. Today, we produce 43,000 bbl/d, 10 times what we started with.</p><h4>Daleel is Oman's third largest producer after Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) and Oxy. What factors led you to become one of the main players in this industry?</h4><p>Similar to other oil and gas companies, we have a structured approach toward the oil and gas business and try to run it in the most efficient manner possible, which adds value. Carrying out  proper studies as a basis for the field development plans, appraising the fields, utilizing new technologies, and building employees' competence are some of the main factors that led the company to be among the top players in the oil and gas sector. We also have great shareholders, both our private shareholders and the ministry. They have supported our programs and put trust in us, enabling the company to develop the way it has done over the past 12 years.</p><h4>Daleel is operating in a block almost 500 kilometers from Muscat. How extensive are your remaining reserves?</h4><p>We have increased our reserves considerably as of January 2014. Our reserve base looks solid and we are looking for further growth using new technologies. Currently, we are in secondary recovery, which is the water flood, but we are preparing for the future. We are investigating enhanced oil recovery (EOR) with pilots during 2014 for surfactant and enzyme flooding. We are carrying out trials into further infield drilling for smaller well spacing. If these all prove successful, our future path will be well defined and developed, and will enable us to sustain our production levels. That work is ongoing and will take one or two years for us to be able to define the potential available to us; however, we believe that the potential is there. So far, surfactant flooding has yielded positive results. At Daleel, we want to improve our drilling performance and the drilling team, for example, looks at the latest technologies through which to achieve that. As of 2013, we acquired a seismic survey for the whole block, which is due to be completed by the end of June 2014. This survey uses advanced technology with wide azimuth and high-density coverage, which will actually give us higher resolution for both shallow and deep reservoirs. For now, we are only producing from the shallow reservoirs; however, we want to see if there is a possibility for deep reservoirs as well. We use SCADA for well monitoring, which offers better surveillance of the wells and the subsurface parameters. We are trying hydro-jet injection technology to increase well performance.</p><h4>How do you see Oman's production capabilities changing?</h4><p>I think it will only get better. Oil doesn't come out easily in Oman. We have had a hard time since day one. Our reservoirs are complicated and production is not easy. Other countries in the region have it a lot easier. The upside of that is that Oman is at the forefront of technology utilization, especially EOR. This places Oman in a position for continued improving and developing.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us about the inception and development of the National Gas Company (NGC)?<br></h4><p>NGC has been in operation for over three decades, and has been a listed company from the outset. We have been engaged in the bottling and distribution of LPG since 1981, and we are also bulk LPG distributors. Primarily, the company was a supplier of gas to residential customers through a distributor network. Because of the regulations on branding, pricing, and cylinder replacements, the margins have shrunk over the years. This led the company to seek out new opportunities beyond Oman. In 2006, the company ventured out into the UAE market. We buy gas at international prices and sell it to the UAE market through a wholly-owned subsidiary in the UAE. Launching operations in the UAE has been one of NGC's milestones, as it contributes significantly to our business. The gas business has two components: the first is subsidized gas and the other export gas. Subsidized gas is available for distribution within the Sultanate of Oman, while export gas comes from another source. In 2012, we looked into expansion to Southeast Asia. At the time, Shell was selling its Malaysian LPG business, the second largest business of its kind in Malaysia, which NGC successfully bid for and acquired. The leader of the Malaysian market is state-owned  company, Petronas, while we are the single largest private sector player in the peninsular Malaysian market. The acquisition promoted us to a higher league: our pre-acquisition annual revenues of approximately OMR20 million, have subsequently reached around OMR120 million.</p><h4>What's the importance of the local market for NGC?</h4><p>The Omani market is still at the core of our operations. We have been in dialogue with the government to modify regulations that intervene in the normal course of business. LPG continues to be an important line of business for Oman considering its social and economic implications, and NGC aims to supply it in the local market, be it to meet household or industrial demand.</p><p>We are currently awaiting the passage of a new regulation that stipulates the mandatory replacement of cylinders every 15 years, which would impact our local business significantly. Another challenge is related to the nature of cylinders in the market, which are not branded by any single player given that no law stipulates this. As a result, when a cylinder is bought, it is fitted by one company, and can then be serviced by any other company when refilling. Ultimately, the company bears losses, as it replaces old cylinders with new ones that eventually get refilled by any other company. The issue on branding has repeatedly been brought to the government's attention. Hopefully, this situation will be resolved. Pricing and selling is another problem demanding urgent attention. Since gas is a socially subsidized product, prices were fixed many years back. And yet operational costs have been on the rise over the years, which has resulted in imbalance.</p><h4>Do you also manage the entire logistics process?</h4><p>Yes, we have our own fleet of vehicles-tankers and bobtails that we use to transport the product to the customer, or to our plants. We also have an in-house competent fleet maintenance team to address all related issues for our fleet.</p><h4>You have recently announced the awarding of a contract to supply LPG tanks in Saudi Arabia. What is the importance of this market for your business?</h4><p>This numbers among various projects that we are working on in Saudi Arabia, and we have many such projects coming up. We are in the process of establishing a wholly-owned subsidiary in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, to tap into the huge infrastructural development occurring there. Hopefully, our project and equipment supplying business will receive a boost in that market once the subsidiary commences commercial operations.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you elaborate on the main policy measures that have allowed the Central Bank of Oman (CBO) to consolidate the financial environment and the banking sector in the Sultanate?<br></h4><p>The CBO has been pro-actively taking measures to strengthen the banking system in the Sultanate. The CBO had initiated a number of regulatory and supervisory measures in the recent period, keeping in view the outcome of the recent global financial crisis and subsequent financial sector reforms suggested by the global standards-setting bodies. To mention a few of them, a financial stability unit has been set up within the CBO for macro-prudential supervision of the financial system. The minimum regulatory capital for banks was raised from 10% to 12% of risk-weighted assets. The CBO is well ahead in the implementation of the Basel III framework. In addition, new micro prudential norms have been introduced for personal loans. The ceiling rate on personal loans has also been reduced in stages and currently stands at 6%. Also, several steps are being taken to promote SMEs for the diversification and growth of the economy and the potential for increased job opportunities. The financial health of banks in terms of asset quality, provision coverage, capital adequacy, and profitability has continued to improve in recent years. The balance sheet of the commercial banks further strengthened in 2013 due to robust growth in both deposits and credit. The total assets of commercial banks increased by 7.2% to OMR22.4 billion in December 2013 from OMR20.9 billion at the end of 2012. The provisional figures on non-performing loans (NPLs) as a percentage of total credit stood lower at around 2% in December 2013 compared to 2.2% in December 2012. The CAR at 16.6% of risk-weighted assets (provisional) in December 2013 (compared to 16% in December 2012) was higher than the minimum regulatory requirement of 12% prescribed by the CBO. The provisional net profits of the commercial banks continued to remain high at OMR351 million in 2013 as compared to OMR305 million in 2012. The outlook for the Omani banking sector in the next few years remains positive taking into account the pace of economic diversification and the role of the private sector in the development process.</p><h4>Banks are supposed to allocate 5% of their total credit to SMEs.What other measures have to be taken to support their development?</h4><p>The relevance of the SMEs sector has always been recognized in Oman given its important role in the diversification and growth of the economy and the potential for increased job opportunities. In fact, in the past, several banks already had a SME finance base, while some banks were more active than others. However, now the government and the CBO have brought the development of the SME sector to the forefront and several policy initiatives, including formal targets for credit delivery to this sector, are being taken on a priority basis. The CBO has advised that banks allocate 5% of their total credit to SMEs to be achieved by December 2014. To encourage lending to SMEs, the prudential requirement for banks to lend to SMEs has been relaxed in terms of general provisioning requirements and risk weightage.</p><h4>What is your economic and financial outlook for 2015?</h4><p>The Omani economy has been growing at a sustained pace in recent years. The major drivers of growth in Oman have been recovery in the prices of crude oil in the international markets and increasing domestic demand, mainly supported by large public expenditure and accommodative monetary policy pursued by the CBO. All these factors are expected to remain favorable in the near future and given the expected strong fiscal position, the government would be in a position to pursue an expansionary fiscal policy so as to sustain the current growth momentum. The future prospects of the Omani economy in 2014 and beyond remains promising taking into account the pace of economic diversification, favorable oil prices, sustained domestic demand, accommodative monetary policy, large expenditure planned by the government, and the role of the private sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

Through a series of mergers and acquisitions over the next decade, the bank expanded its network and we solidified our presence in the market. From the inception of BankDhofar, we have taken the strategic decision to accelerate our growth through organic and non-organic growth while focusing on sustained performance. Over time, we have in effect grown both organically and non-organically as there have been several mergers and acquisitions to reach and grow to our current size. Today, BankDhofar is ranked among the top banks in the country in terms of size.</p><h4>How would you assess your performance in 2014?</h4><p>We have a clear business plan, and we are implementing our 2014 business plan with focus on sustained growth and consistent performance. To give some perspective to our performance, from June 2013 to June 2014 in terms of total assets, we have grown by about 21.29% and in terms of deposits we have grown 26.07% YoY over the same period. In terms of net loans and advances we have grown by 20.75%, and in equity we have grown by 7.49%. Therefore, our assets and liabilities are growing, and the bottom line is also growing. On the other hand, in terms of operating income we have achieved an increase of 8.76%, and in net profit after taxes and deductions we have grown by 15.12%. We have been able to manage our costs by reviewing some of our internal processes that have not previously been focused on. We are reviewing those areas to identify how we can improve our operating model, to benefit fully from all our investments in the latest technologies and other business improvement initiatives. Overall growth is strong, and we received the “Best Bank in Oman" award for 2013 in recognition of our consistent achievements and performance.</p><h4>Can you share with us BankDhofar's strategy to support SMEs in Oman?</h4><p>We signed an agreement with the Oman Development Bank (ODB), and while ODB will manage the financing, it would like commercial banks to participate as well. That is one of the initiatives where the government and banks partner and work together for the benefit of all parties. We started our own initiative a long time before that because we had realized that this is the future for the country, as the Omani business economy cannot rely on few large corporates—we need to develop SMEs. Therefore, one of the pillars of our five-year strategic plan, which started in 2012, is to cater to SMEs and the country's youth. We have established centers in the main regions of the country, and have also been recruiting the right expertise to cater to this kind of business because it differs from normal corporate business in terms of its requirements, size, and knowledge base.</p><h4>How did BankDhofar's Islamic finance window Maisarah perform over 2013?</h4><p>Islamic banking came in at the right time, and suddenly the demand for it has increased. The government responded positively and provided the service by developing the sector in terms of regulations and licensing. Like the conventional side of the business, this sector is equally competitive and most banks have Islamic windows, and new Islamic banks are being established. We started offering Islamic banking services in March 2013. From March 2013 until 3Q2014, the level of growth has been exponential to say the least. That is reflected in the awards we been receiving as we were named the best Islamic window in the country, and our portfolio is growing in terms of services provided.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you elaborate on the role of the Ministry?<br></h4><p>With regard to promoting the oil and gas sector, we primarily promote all of the available open blocks for foreign or local investment. We normally know who the interested players are, giving them the opportunity to review available data and make their own assessments and judge the value of the block. Then, they put a bid together regarding the proposal to develop it. We then evaluate the different options and enter into an exploration agreement with the winning company. Thus, our role is to bring more players into the market and make sure all open blocks are commercialized and active. Once a company is on the ground and working, we spend a great deal of time with it to make sure that its management understands the rules and regulations of Oman, as well as ensure they interact with other players in terms of synergy. I would cite BP and PDO as good examples of this. PDO supplies BP with electricity and also transports BP gas and condensate, both on a tariff basis. There is also integration with Oman Gas Company, which supplies gas to consumers. BP has a relationship with them, and we entered the relationship as a final custodian of the gas.</p><h4>What were the highlights of 2013?</h4><p>In 2013, I think the major highlight was on the Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) front. It was probably one of the best years for many companies, especially PDO, the largest operator, which achieved the best year ever in terms of incident frequency. The other operators also reported excellent HSE results. Production-wise, I think 940,000 bbl/d was an excellent achievement. Also, from a concession perspective, 2013 saw the signing of a concession with BP following extensive negotiations. We also signed an offshore concession with Total and PetroTel. Overall, 2013 also saw positive results from the exploration program conducted by Masirah Oil Limited Offshore. Therefore, offshore is gaining greater momentum, which I consider welcome news.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on the importance of  $1.2 billion contract for BP's Khazzan project?</h4><p>BP-Khazzan is a major undertaking that translates to production of 28 million cubic meters (mcm) of gas per day, which is one-third of today's production. By the time it comes on stream in late 2017 or early 2018, it will probably provide one-quarter of what we need in terms of gas. It will also allow us to create a buffer between supply and demand where, for a chain, we will have slightly more capacity to supply gas than there is demand in the market. This buffer provides the required breathing space in which to conduct maintenance, and so on. At the moment, each mishap translates into a shortage for one consumer or another. By creating that buffer, hopefully mishaps at gas plants or fields will not necessarily translate into shortages due to our ability to close that gap from alternative supply. In addition, we are confirming our ability to supply from deep, tight gas fields. Being able to secure that supply will give us the confidence to venture into unconventional gas plays on a bigger scale.</p><h4>Oman recently signed a landmark agreement for natural gas from Iran. What does this milestone mean for gas-intensive industries in Oman?</h4><p>What we have signed so far is a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). There are many things that still need to take place before the project starts registering any milestones. Once complete, it will translate into about 28 mcm of gas. To me, it will bring diversification of supply, which is important because, thus far, we have been relying heavily on our own indigenous gas supply. Of course, there is a small volume being imported; however, it is negligible and destined for Sohar's industry. I think that if the Iranian gas does materialize, it will open up avenues of diversification for gas supply from beyond local production. It will definitely support enhanced oil recovery (EOR) production because EOR projects will demand more gas.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you rate the performance of Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) in 2014 compared to last year?<br></h4><p>We are very proud of our performance in a number of key areas. Firstly, safety, where we recorded the lowest lost time incident frequency (LTIF) and total recordable case frequency (TRCF) on record. In process safety management and asset integrity, several assets reached calculative status, which is a high international standard of integrity assurance. On the production side, we also set new (combined oil and gas) records. We have continued to build oil production and to meet the increasing demand for gas. On the exploration front, notwithstanding more than four decades of drilling, we continue to have high success rates. The portfolio is, of course, getting more difficult; for example, we are getting into tighter, deeper gas developments, but we are highly encouraged by extended test results. On the well reservoir facilities management (WRFM) front, we continue to set the benchmark and have received much global recognition. Ultimately, it is all about the performance of the fields. You have to get the basics right and also successfully implement enhanced oil recovery (EOR) technologies. We have fields that are producing more today than they were 30 years ago, and there are very few examples of that around the world. Thanks to considerable well intervention and restoration work, we now have very low decline rates in fields that previously were subject to high decline rates. Project delivery is also getting stronger, while the exponential growth and challenges of our business, including water production, the number of wells, and power requirements, means that driving lean and continuous improvement are a must for longer-term success and to manage the transition from primary to secondary to tertiary production. All in all, it was a good year, but there is no complacency and our focus remains on improving all parts of our business, including how we interact and support our contractor community.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on the importance of technology and innovation as a key driver for your business?</h4><p>We operate in an increasingly complex environment that needs to rely on more efficient energy management and more advanced and efficient subsurface displacement mechanisms. We are reviewing, testing, piloting, and prototyping some 70 different technologies at any one time. Some of them work, some of them don't, while some of them go into full-scale implementation—it is a never-ending process. We work with many different companies to help us deal with some of the challenges we face. One such challenge is water management. PDO produces considerable volumes of water of different salinities. The Nimr reed beds project is a fantastic success, enabling us to handle more than 700,000 barrels of produced water, with a 98% reduction in energy use. We can't use that solution 100 kilometers south or north of Nimr because water salinities, and other contaminants, are very different.</p><h4>How is PDO managing the increasing demand for gas, and why is the resource a priority for the country?</h4><p>Gas remains a key and strategic fuel for today and the foreseeable future. It is cleaner, more reliable, and more efficient than oil-fueled energy. Power and desalination plants, energy exports, and domestic industrial expansion are all largely driven by fuel-gas. On the supply side, we are trying to explore, connect, deliver, and compress as much gas as possible in a cost-effective way. On the demand side, we are not just a large energy supplier, we are also a significant energy user, for example for thermal EOR processes that are fuel-gas intensive. As a result, we place huge emphasis on energy optimization, indeed as much as we do on energy exploration.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Shell developed in Oman over recent years?<br></h4><p>A relatively recent development has been the establishment, in 2002, of a Shell office separate from the joint ventures in which we are partners—Petroleum Development Oman (PDO), Oman LNG, and Shell Oman Marketing (SOM). We are a minority shareholder in each of these, with the principal shareholder of the first two being the government of the Sultanate of Oman and the Omani public owning the majority of the third through the Muscat Stock Exchange. We subsequently also became a partner in Occidental's development of the Mukhaizna field. The establishment of a separate Shell office has enabled us better to reach into the wider Royal Dutch Shell group on behalf of our joint ventures in Oman in order to deliver cutting-edge technology and experienced people to the ventures. This ensures that we help the joint ventures deliver projects, enhance their operational excellence, and continuously improve their performance. Other relatively recent Shell in Oman milestones include the 2006 opening of the Shell Technology Oman (STO) office, which is a vehicle for our strategic alliance with PDO on enhanced oil recovery (EOR), the 2010 Technical Support Agreement, which put Shell's technical support under the PDO board governance structure, the Services Agreement signed with Oman LNG the same year, and the 2011 Technology Development Cooperation Agreement between Shell, the government, and PDO. We now have four other strategic technological alliances with PDO, in addition to EOR, covering smart fields, geophysical technologies, materials and corrosion, and fiber optics for wells and reservoir management, with the last two added in 2014.</p><h4>How would you assess the importance of enhanced oil recovery (EOR) for the Sultanate of Oman? What kind of contribution are you providing to PDO and Oman LNG?</h4><p>According to the government, approximately 18% of Oman's current oil production involves EOR. Part of this is Occidental's development of the Mukhaizna field, which is one of the largest steam flood operations in the world. In PDO, the percentage of its oil production using EOR is currently 11%, but PDO expects this to reach 33% by 2023. Hence, EOR is increasingly important for the Sultanate of Oman. The relationship between Shell and PDO on EOR is truly symbiotic in the sense that PDO benefits from Shell's world-class subject matter experts in a range of different EOR disciplines and from Shell's global EOR network, while Shell benefits from PDO's experience implementing novel EOR technologies. This cooperation has placed Oman, PDO, and Shell at the forefront of global EOR innovation. Shell's contribution to PDO and Oman LNG is, by means of technology, people, and a strong focus on asset integrity, safety, and project delivery, helping them to be the extraordinary companies that they are. SOM is one of the leading companies on the local stock exchange, and PDO and Oman LNG are principal engines of the Omani economy. The contribution that these companies make is important to Oman, and we are honored and proud to be partners.</p><h4>SMEs play a critical role in Oman's economy. How are you supporting young entrepreneurs in that respect?</h4><p>We have a program called Intilaaqah, based on the Shell LiveWire program, which was started in the UK in 1982. It aims to give young people the entrepreneurial and innovative skills required to start their own businesses. We have been running Intilaaqah in Oman since 1995. Intilaaqah is a training scheme that takes people through the process of starting their own businesses and teaches participants how to make business plans, apply for funding, and covers a series of other aspects on how to successfully run a business. In 2007, we expanded beyond training by establishing a fund to finance start-ups. In 2011 we enhanced that fund with an additional cash injection, and developed it into the Nomou Fund, which is run by the Shell Foundation and GroFin. Through Intilaaqah we have recently signed MoUs with Future Generations International and Haya Water. We intend to sign an MoU with Al Raffd Fund, too. The first step for an Intilaaqah student is to attend a one-day “Bright Ideas" workshop. We aim for around 2,000 people to go through those every year.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you elaborate on your current operations and the ways in which you are planning to expand their scope in the near future?<br></h4><p>GEO-Resources was established in July 1999 as a wholly Omani company. Since then, the objective has been to build a company that supports the development of Oman's infrastructure and economy and allows it to be part of development activities in Oman. I think it is fundamentally important that people cannot get a piece of land to build on until they get environmental approval. That is radical and it indicates the great emphasis that Oman has placed on the importance of environmental protection. Our role is not to get environmental approvals for companies. It is as much about educating the client as presenting their projects to the government. We provide our services to many clients in Oman, from the oil sector to tourism and industry, from Muscat to Salalah and Duqm. In that sense, we have covered all parts of Oman. We do a lot of environmental work to support various development projects. We also cover the water resources in Oman; we do a lot of hydro-geological work and support the ongoing water sustainability programs. GEO-Resources also covers surveying activities, from geology to land surveying and seismic studies for oil companies. We also are involved in the mining sector through our geological work. We also cover investigations and run evaluations for some projects. We have a very long list of clients. GEO-Resources works with the government, as well as the oil and gas sector through Petroleum Development Oman (PDO), Oxy, Petrogas, and all the main players in this segment of the economy; we also work in the tourism sector, analyzing the environmental impact of new structures.</p><h4>How is the company positioned to develop new capabilities?</h4><p>Technology is crucial. Other companies have come to the market since we have been established, but we have maintained our position among the leading companies in Oman by providing the services that are needed to make a client satisfied with our work and desire a long-term collaboration and relationship together. Working with clients on a long-term basis has been our strategy since the very beginning. There are a couple of other aspects that underpin this business model. One is that we try not to step on other people's feet. For example, a natural extension of the services we offer is engineering, but we don't do that because, if we did, we would be in opposition to the engineers who are our clients. The other aspect is employment and training a core of Omanis. A great priority is the training, both at a university level and for our own staff. That is the future of the company. We employ about 40 people and the company meets Omanization requirements. Whenever a competent Omani becomes available to us, we employ him or her.</p><h4>What are the main challenges your business faces in Oman?</h4><p>The challenge is always to maintain the quality of services that we provide to our clients. That is something we are continuously working on. That means making ongoing improvements in order to see the right quality delivered. There are some other challenges as well. One of them is to make sure that Omanis within the company are gaining the knowledge required and are able to deliver and maintain their existence in the company. We also have our own in-house system improvements that allow us to meet those challenges. Part of the challenge for us is to maintain the level of growth so there is a chance for our senior Omanis to progress. You can't do that with a very small company, but, as the company grows, there is a greater need for field and operations managers to become general managers.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is Haya Water contributing to the development of Muscat?<br></h4><p>Infrastructure projects underpin the development of any city, wherever it may be in the world. And where infrastructure is incomplete, the city cannot fully take shape. As part of the projects we are involved in, we install taps for fiber optics. Currently, we are also taking an integrated approach of utilities and services as part of our projects. In certain areas, we will also be installing a gas network as part of a development. Therefore, we are looking at an integrated approach for the development of Muscat, and, of course, the same will apply beyond Muscat, too. In the country overall, the idea is to develop the wastewater network, and, with that, other utilities networks. This will expedite the development not only of Muscat, but also of Oman as a whole.</p><h4>How do you rate Oman in terms of wastewater management compared to other GCC countries?</h4><p>Dubai, for example, has a wastewater system in certain areas, but not universally. And if you travel from Dubai to Oman, you find a long line of yellow tankers leading to a plant by the highway. We are ahead of Dubai in certain terms, while lagging in others. Yet, Oman is in the process of developing nationwide. In the Emirates, and particularly in Abu Dhabi, it appears that various municipalities are undertaking responsibility for their respective zones. In contrast, Oman's infrastructural efforts are centralized under a single entity for better supervision and greater efficiency. Moreover, the size of Oman does not merit multiple entities.</p><h4>Does your activity in Muscat represent a template of effective water management and treatment for the region?</h4><p>I would answer yes, absolutely. In fact, we have a project in all areas of Muscat. Modern cities will have a single vast reservoir, which we will service. And once this model proves successful, it will be applied to historical cities, such as Nizwa, Sohar, Sur, and Salalah. In Europe, many cities have narrow streets, and Mutrah is rather like that. Certain European cities first developed, and then installed infrastructure around 200 years ago. Others did the reverse. We fit into the former category, meaning that we develop cities first, and Mutrah will be the role model for that approach.</p><h4>What is the impact of Haya Water on the local environment?</h4><p>It is huge, and one crucial object we pursue is the prevention of ground water contamination. We transform the sludge generated at treatment plants into a user-friendly product, namely compost. And to make a huge volume of water available, we could reduce our reliance on energy-intensive desalination plants. This is one of the ways in which we contribute to environmental protection.</p><h4>How do you contribute to the agricultural sector?</h4><p>We are looking at how we can use treated water for agriculture. We have already commenced dialog with the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries and are poised to work on experimental farms for a three-year period. If successful, we could proceed to actual implementation. We also supply the market with our fertilizer “Kala," today highly popular and demanded by farmers nationwide.</p><h4>What are some of your major achievements of recent years?</h4><p>In terms of numbers, Omanization is one of our key attributes. We have now reached almost an 82% Omanization rate, which is a stunning achievement. In certain areas, we have also worked on our cost controls. Meanwhile, we are seeing an annual increase in our treated effluent (TE) utilization rate. At the moment, we supply water to four golf courses in Oman. Significantly too, we have increased our customer base, adding 5,000 customers in 2013 alone.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main successes of the Public Establishment for Industrial Estates (PEIE) over recent years?<br></h4><p>The investment climate in Oman today is really fantastic for foreign investors looking to come in and set up their projects. That is why PEIE has already achieved most of what had been highlighted during the initial plans. We have received almost OMR4.6 billion worth of investments. We have an existing seven industrial areas and a free zone close to the border with Yemen. Because of the investment attractions here, we have expanded and we have added the Smail Industrial Estate, 35 kilometers from Rusayl. This is in the final stage, and we now have more than 80% occupancy. The total infrastructure cost  is more than OMR70 million, but the most important aspect of these achievements is job creation. One of our achievements for attracting investments, local or foreign, was to have in-country value (ICV). And in terms of ICV, one of the most important aspects is employment. Here, we have expanded our Omanization rate to approximately 41% by mid-2014.</p><h4>What kind of support is PEIE offering to the development and consolidation of SMEs in the country?</h4><p>PEIE serves SMEs first and foremost. PEIE has initiated an innovating program called the National Business Center, which was established in 2011. Its aim is to help and support locals to build their ideas, support them, and put them in touch with the Oman Development Bank (ODB). There are some successful stories of companies growing under the PEIE, which started their business and developed from our incubation program to then set up their own projects. If we are able to support many of these every year, we will probably be able to have more than 50 companies, all with five to 10 Omanis working in them. Then, we are really solving a problem. We are creating and promoting a new business culture and encouraging entrepreneurship in the country.</p><h4>What are the main obstacles that SMEs and local entrepreneurs face here when starting a business?</h4><p>When setting up a business in Oman, there is a lack of experience among locals. It is mainly about a lack of finance and management talent. Today, the government is fully supportive and is providing different types of finance, grants, and loans for these businesses. Also, the majority of the people setting up businesses now are graduates, and the local institutions are helping and supporting them in the market in terms of management and finance. All of this will help these SMEs succeed and grow.</p><h4>How is PEIE contributing to providing a welcoming environment for foreign investors in Oman?</h4><p>In certain areas, foreigners can own up to 70% of a company. There is also a law that stipulates that, in the first five years, businesses are tax-free and can enjoy customs exemptions on imported raw materials, goods, and spare parts. Besides that, we have some of the best infrastructure around. Oman is not just a business hub; it is a place where you can come and live. There are several factors aside from just incentives that give Oman more benefits than neighboring companies for people to come to and set up a business. There are multiple opportunities in the country, including downstream, which is about building up  correlations with some of the large projects, while the railway project is one of the largest areas of investment. Also, Duqm will provide many opportunities. Oman is one of the best areas for people to come and invest, and the bulk of investment is from either the Indian subcontinent or from other Arab countries. These are the areas where our foreign investment is coming from. This gives Oman opportunities to re-export, as the country has good FTAs.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you elaborate on Omantel's role in the rapid development of the Sultanate's telecommunications environment?<br></h4><p>Our business strategy is aligned with the growth and development of the Sultanate; we always keep an eye on future infrastructure projects in order to ensure that state-of-the-art telecommunications services are available and provided by Omantel. Telecommunications infrastructure is an enabler for economic and social growth since it is an essential tool for empowering people at the same time as creating a business climate that nurtures innovation and efficient business processes. There is a wealth of evidence that supports the fact that there is a direct link between the economic and social development of a region and the robustness of telecommunications infrastructure availability.</p><h4>Omantel invested OMR75 million in telecommunications infrastructure during 2013. What are the major results of this significant investment?</h4><p>We have invested mainly in strengthening our fixed-line infrastructure, which is the most extensive fixed-line service infrastructure in the Sultanate of Oman, in addition to further rolling out the latest mobile technology, 4G, to enable our customers to benefit from the high-speed broadband offered by this network.</p><h4>Omantel is associated with the Oman Fiber Optic Company (OFC). What is the importance of this partnership?</h4><p>OFC was primarily established to manufacture fiber-optic cables and is the only fiber-optic manufacturer in Oman. OFC also provides the basic infrastructure, including fixed-line infrastructure, and has recently also expanded the scope of its activities to include provision of wireless communications infrastructure for oil fields and other far-flung areas, which has now become a substantial part of its business. In addition, we are also associated with Oman Data Park (ODP), which is engaged in providing ICT solutions, and provides and manages hosting services for large corporations. ODP also provides state-of-the-art cloud computing services to SMEs and we are very proud of having these two companies, among others, to complement our core business.</p><h4>SMEs are a key driver for the national economy and a hot topic in Oman today. How are you supporting their activities?</h4><p>We have a specific focus on SMEs, and a special department focusing solely on SMEs, which has developed two specific packages already. One is called A'amali, and the other is called A'amali 2, which in Arabic means “my business." A'amali 2, for example, provides entrepreneurs with a package of fixed internet and mobile telephony. That is one side, directly from Omantel, but also from our subsidiary, ODP, which we established specifically to provide entrepreneurial solutions. We have cloud services through which an entrepreneur can go online and pick and choose services. For example, if I am an entrepreneur, I will need to buy laptops, servers, and so forth, and this service allows me to go online and pick the number of servers and the speed, and I simply receive an invoice for that package, which can be tailored later on. We do that at a very competitive price. Recently, ODP launched an array of highly promising cloud-based services, such as infrastructure-as-a-service (IAAS), platform-as-a-service (PAAS), and software-as-a-service (SAAS). ODP is one of the pioneers to have commercially launched these services in the Middle East region. The service allows its subscribers to set up a server in the cloud and enable ODP to offer state-of-the-art and world-class services and compete with the likes of global multinational players but with the edge that the customers of ODP have their data and applications in Oman, which results in far higher quality and security than what the international competitors can offer.</p><h4>What is the importance of human resources to Omantel?</h4><p>Omantel is what it is today thanks only to the dedicated team of 2,800 skilled professionals from all parts of the country. Our main strength is our people, who share the same vision, and for me they are the real heroes of Omantel's success. We have a leadership style of delegation through engagement and we work actively to empower our staff through training and coaching. Since 2012, we have run an extensive engagement program through which our staff are actively involved in developing our corporate strategy and participate in steering and executing the strategy through programs at the top management level. This has been clearly reflected in the employee engagement survey carried out by a third party, Ernst &amp; Young, where Omantel scored 93% on team loyalty to the company.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[board-strategy]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why did the Council of Ministers establish the Oman Broadband Company?<br></h4><p>Oman is facing many challenges when it comes to geography and population distribution. Oman has a population of 10 people per square kilometer, which is very low compared to other regional countries. That means that any infrastructure projects that you carry out will only serve a few people at a high infrastructure cost against a low return on investment. That makes it difficult for the telecommunications operators or for the private sector to invest as the commercial justification is simply not there. As a consequence, Oman has been experiencing significant growth when it comes to mobile broadband; however, we are lagging behind when it comes to fixed-broadband penetration. We are the second country in the Gulf in terms of mobile penetration, while we are the last when it comes to fixed broadband. The government would like to achieve open access to telecommunications infrastructure for both current and future operators, with equivalence in access and transparent pricing. Having this infrastructure funded and owned by the government makes it easier for the operators to focus on competing and investing in high-quality internet and other services.</p><h4>What will be the impact of consolidated broadband infrastructure on Oman's economy?</h4><p>It has been proven worldwide that any growth in fixed broadband reflects a direct impact on GDP. Statistics say that the GDP of developing countries grew by 1.38 percentage points for each 10% increase in national broadband penetration. This is the direct impact on the economy, but there are other benefits of having more widespread broadband, one of them being the creation of a knowledge-based economy. We want to create job opportunities in the technology and ICT sectors, and employ graduates. We will also assist in the creation of a platform for electronic services and the development of the content- and cloud-based service sectors. The new broadband infrastructure linked with Oman's strategic geographical position and the favorable access to international internet gateways creates the opportunity to elevate Oman to a key regional internet and hosting hub. This in itself has fundamental implications for Oman's economy and international recognition.</p><h4>What kind of technology will be applied to the development of broadband in the Sultanate?</h4><p>A few years back, the government used the opportunity and decided to lay fiber alongside wastewater network projects in Muscat. This strategic decision means that we are not starting from zero; we are starting with around 20% coverage of fiber optics in Muscat. Therefore, the immediate task and opportunity is to enable operators to use existing fiber optics. It will be operational from 2015, and will be offered as a wholesale service for all licensed operators to be able to offer fiber broadband services to their customer base in Muscat. In general, the Oman Broadband Company has three main plans when it comes to the implementation of broadband. These plans will run in parallel to expand the reachability and accelerate the rollout of broadband across the Sultanate. The first one is for the Muscat region, where as mentioned we will be commercializing the existent fiber of Haya Water after transferring it to Oman Broadband Company and then expanding the rollout to cover about 90% of Muscat by 2021. The second plan focuses on the urban regions lying outside Muscat where, due to the lower demand and the geographical spread, we are to steadily deploy fiber until 2030. Again, in order to do this we are to align with other utility projects across the country, therefore reducing the civil works cost of the fiber deployment program.  In the interim until fiber reaches these areas, we are to support the operators in delivering mobile broadband by providing backhaul connectivity to their sites and supporting the deployment of new telecoms towers. The third plan is for the rural areas that are currently not covered. We are working with the operators to reach all areas by satellite or wireless, and to provide basic broadband services. We build the backbone infrastructure, and the operators come in and offer their services.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the key metrics behind Oman ORIX Leasing Company?<br></h4><p>At present, the company's paid-up share capital is OMR23.44 million. In terms of performance, we can proudly say that growth during 2013-2014 was phenomenal. We have performed outstandingly during the past one and half years, and within the finance industry Oman ORIX reported the highest level of growth of close to 30%. The industry average was around 10%-12%. We expected to continue this trend during 2014 as well, and our half yearly results support this view. It is worthwhile to point out that even during this high growth phase the company's NPA remained in control, and Oman ORIX's portfolio is one of the best in the industry in terms of asset quality. In line with the company's strategy to recruit and nurture local talent, Oman ORIX has been continuously recruiting and training Omani youth in various positions in the company. The Omanization ratio of the company currently stands at 80%.</p><h4>What factors have led to this growth?</h4><p>We developed new team, new strategies, and we have utilized our expertise in SME financing into corporate segments through a cautious approach. One of our major strength in SME/corporate financing is turnaround time besides high-quality customer care. Previously, we were known to the market as a retail finance company; however, during the past one and half years we were able to make a paradigm shift in this perception of the market, and as a result the growth mainly came from these sectors.</p><h4>Is there still potential within the SME segment?</h4><p>There are a lot of opportunities in this segment, and I think growth will continue for the next five or six years. We don't see any downturn in the near future. The government has a lot of plans running up until 2020, and it has already started implementing many of them; I think Oman ORIX can increase its share of SME and corporate business as a result. The banks are there, but there are also opportunities, because the SME sector is internationally known to be serviced by non-banking finance companies with their flexibility to provide tailor-made finance solutions as compared to banks. We have a project in the pipeline specifically to support small companies (micro SMEs), and the Central Bank of Oman (CBO) has also shown great interest in promoting this segment for the balanced growth of the economy. We are coming up with some products that are going to inject working capital so that local firms can develop and establish their organizations on a more sound footing.</p><h4>Can you tell us about you portfolio composition?</h4><p>As of May 2014, we have generated almost 59% from our corporate business and 41% from our retail lines. We would like to see this company at 30% retail and 70% corporate somewhere within two years' time. We developed new teams and entered this field in the last two years. Before 2013, we used to write just a small number of corporate transactions. Today, we have separate teams writing big tickets, in the millions, and we have another team looking only after SMEs. We have divided the business into three core sectors: micro, SMEs, and corporate clients.</p><h4>What distinguishes you from your competitors?</h4><p>What is the main asset of a finance company or any company in this sector? It is the team that they have. Here at Oman ORIX, the culture that is being built up is a mixed culture derived from our international shareholders, which represent over 28 countries around the world. This supports us in retaining our team members. Today, we have employees that have been here for over a decade. They are now senior members, and they are the main assets of this organization. The development of the business came through the support of the major shareholders, and the mixture of these cultures helps to differentiate us from our competitors.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the performance of the Muscat Securities Market (MSM) over the last year?<br></h4><p>The MSM's issue has always been liquidity. Since 2013, the MSM was a bit slow compared to the other markets in the Gulf; however, we have recently seen a big improvement. Two IPOs were announced in May 2014, and it has boosted the MSM as it has witnessed a huge oversubscription for such IPOs. In Oman, more companies need to be traded on the MSM. More IPOs will generate a vibrant exchange, which benefits the market locally. On a different note, the MSM also requires a lot of innovative products to be launched. The market needs depth, which can be achieved by introduction of structured products, bonds, sukuks, and other different kinds of investment instruments.</p><h4>What kind of services does Al Madina Investment (AMI) provide?</h4><p>AMI started its journey back in 1998. As of today, the firm has been known to the Omani and GCC market as a firm that provides investment-banking services. Throughout, we have delivered to the market many private equity transactions, which led to the birth of Al Madina Real Estate, Al Madina Logistics, Al Madina Takaful, the Tilal Fund (the first and only real estate fund), and the Tilal Sukuk (the first sukuk in Oman), to name a few. We are proud to mention that to date we have raised around $500 million. This is an excellent achievement taking into consideration our humble set up.</p><h4>With the issuance of the first sukuk in Oman you have played a historic part in the Islamic finance sector in the Sultanate. How are Islamic products shaping the capital markets?</h4><p>Islamic products are being proven day-by-day to be some of the best products out there because they are based on real assets. All the Islamic banks continued growing throughout the crisis of 2008. And of course, this was based on real assets and not artificial transaction. Worldwide, there is a huge shortage of Islamic finance products. Every year, Islamic asset management, sharia-compliant banking, and takaful companies are growing, but they need assets and products to invest in. It is then up to the investment companies to come up with new structured products and projects for them. Most of the sukuks that have been launched in the international market have been oversubscribed, and that is because there is a lot of cash in the system. The Oman government has announced that, in the budget of 2014, it will consider structuring the first government sukuk in Oman, worth over OMR200 million. In 2013, we arranged the first sharia-complaint sukuk in the country for Tilal Development Company SAOC, which saw great demand from the market, both local and regional. It was also a rated paper.</p><h4>Are partnerships an important part of your business model?</h4><p>Partnership has been something that we have been leveraging on. When we think of how we can add value, instead of just starting from zero, we look for partners that are in that line of business. Then, we bring them in in two ways; as management in the project and as partners in equity—they add value because it is their concern to grow. It is a recipe for success. It is also very important to know how to grow. I think we offer a great deal of value-added because our main concern is to get Omanis involved. We train a lot of Omanis. We train them to grow and to start their own businesses. Out of 26 employees, 22 are Omanis. In all of our companies, we have a high level of Omanization, although some technical aspects like Islamic sukuks need to have expatriates working on them.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Within a short time, MB Petroleum Services, a subsidiary company within MB Holding, became one of the fastest growing and one of the largest oilfield services companies in the Middle East with operations in over 15 countries with 3,500 employees. How is it contributing to in-country value (ICV) generation?<br></h4><p>For us it works well, because we are probably one of the larger oilfield service companies in Oman. All our businesses have invested heavily in developing the local economy and local employees. ICV has actually increased our revenues. The problem in the past has been unfair competition from companies overseas. Such companies import workers and equipment into Oman, while we buy most of our machinery and equipment from local dealers and employs locals. The key issue in the contract is the extent to which value remains in the country. I think that ICV has been hugely beneficial to both the Omani economy and those local companies that have built resources within the country.</p><h4>Do you think Omanization is a challenge or an opportunity for the country?</h4><p>It is really a case of both. Omanization presents a short-term challenge of training and developing people, but in the long term presents an opportunity, as it is good for both public and private sector companies. It makes economic sense and, after all, the people you train are nationals.</p><h4>Are you targeting any new geographical areas?</h4><p>No, in fact we're doing quite the opposite. We expanded quite a bit and entered markets that were not suited for our businesses. We've since pulled our operations from Indonesia, Cambodia, Thailand, and Laos, as we perform better in the Middle Eastern marketplace.</p><h4>What is the reason behind your recent investments in the tourism sector in Oman?</h4><p>A diversified economy is vital for the Sultanate. Oil is a commodity that tends to fluctuate in terms of price with global demand, whereby excessive reliance on just one product is unwise. Diversifying is also important for every business, which is why we have been diversifying our businesses over the past few years. And so as part of the process we opted to enter the tourism industry, partly because Oman is developing this sector, which is considered a likely contributor to the economy of Oman. Today we have investments in the Park Inn in Muscat and the Golden Tulip in Nizwa. We are shortly opening the Park Inn in Duqm. We are also developing a five-star hotel in Salalah in a 50-50 private public partnership with Omran. We are also developing resorts on the coastline, and have four hotels under construction from four to five stars.</p><h4>What is the importance of joint ventures and partnerships for MB Holding?</h4><p>Generally speaking, we don't enter into joint ventures where ownership is concerned, but rather, we explore them at the technological level. If necessary, we license technology, because we like to retain overall control. The most important business at MB Holding is oil production. We own Petrogas, which owns 50% of Daleel Petroleum, a joint venture of more than 12 years with China National Petroleum Corporation.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did you become one of the main players in the insurance sector here in Oman?<br></h4><p>Obviously, the main insurance products that are being sold are similar in nature. Therefore, what sets each company apart is the way you provide your services and the way the client sees you. Over the last three years, which is what we have been focusing on, I am happy to say that there has been quite a turnaround and the company has grown. We have managed to take a lot of corrective measures in the company. From a loss-making entity in 2011, we are now profitable and all the past losses have been wiped out. Falcon Insurance is now joining the big-league players.</p><h4>What is the composition of your portfolio?</h4><p>Like all insurance companies, motor is the single largest portfolio. If you look at our target for 2014, around 38% of our projected premiums are from motor, while another 18%-20% are from the life and medical areas. Almost the same again, 16%-18%, are derived from property and energy. The engineering class forms about 8%-10%, and the rest is marine, liabilities, and others, which makes up the balance. Our major thrust has always been SMEs. We are a small-to-medium size insurance company, meaning we aim to insure SMEs. We prefer that we service clients across all their insurance requirements, from motor to medical, to group, life, and property. That is how we try to sell; in large portfolios. We are also expanding equally into the retail segment, which, until now, has not been a main thrust. Our major portfolio business is still corporate. Falcon Insurance currently only has three branches; however, we are looking to expand to one or two more and add on some alternative channels of business to improve the company.</p><h4>With 22 companies present in a market of less than 3 million people, the Omani insurance market is beyond saturation. How do you respond to the high levels of competition in the market?</h4><p>The market is extremely overcrowded with players, not only for insurance companies, but also for brokers. This makes it a very competitive market. By nature, the insuring public here is quite price sensitive, which keeps up pressure on insurance premium levels, which is not very healthy for the insurance market. This becomes starkly visible during years when the investment market performs poorly. When the investment market performs well, companies get good investment returns, which camouflages the negative results of their insurance operations. In the years that there is a negative investment market, the problems become more obvious. The last two years have been reasonably good for both segments. Motor is a business that is on the balance sheet of almost all the companies, meaning the impact of losses hits them much more than the other segments. In 4Q2013, we signed an agreement with Bank Muscat to provide life coverage for all the individual borrowers of the bank. This is a massive policy in terms of size, meaning that was a major win for us. In the 15-20 years prior to that, there was only one insurance company to achieve this. We are a major player in the life market, and this is clearly reflective of the fact that the market is now recognizing Falcon as an equally able provider. Fortunately, or unfortunately, we ended up having to pay the biggest banking sector claim. Again, the professionalism of Falcon Insurance and the auditing reinsurance behind it has led this claim to be fully settled. The market is very appreciative of the fact that this was done in such a short time. It was almost a $38 million claim, and was fully settled within a few months.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you elaborate on the milestones reached since Rural Areas Electricity Company (RAECO) was established?<br></h4><p>RAECO was established by the government to replace the activities carried out by the Electricity Ministry in 2005. It was decided that a more business-minded companies would be created, and RAECO is one of those companies. The objective of this company is to provide electricity to areas that are not connected to the main grid and also have a vertical integration license. The company now has 42 power plants, and all of them work with fossil fuels. The company is growing by around 23% every year, doubling its capacity every four years. We started with 180 MW and now we have reached more than 650 MW; we have 336 MW currently under construction, and that is due to demand increases and also the developments that are going on in different areas where we are. The company supplies electricity to all customers in three main governorates: Musandam, Wusta, which is part of Duqm, and Dhofar. We also have authorization to supply customers on the islands that belong to the country, as well as all the oil fields, where there are customers available. We have two sources of generation, one provided by ourselves to build power plants, and the second is to purchase power from Petroleum Development Oman (PDO). We have more than 18 connection points.</p><h4>Driven by the rapid growth of the economy, the country's annual demand for power is expected to rise by as much as 11.4 % to over 9,000 MW by 2019. How does your company respond to changes in the market?</h4><p>Over the last three years, the company also started to think about renewable energy as a solution to the high cost of the fossil fuels that we are using. Oman is one of the best locations for renewable energy; every day we generate more than 600 GW of power from the sun, and all the areas where this company operates are suitable to solar plants and some areas we also have studies on are good sites for wind plants. We have already signed a joint venture agreement for investment in a 60 MW wind energy farm that will be constructed by a UAE-based company, on the south side of the country; it will be connected to the main grid in the rural areas there, and we are expecting that plant to be ready by the end of 2016. We have also signed an independent power producer (IPP) agreement with a US company to produce power using a solar plant in the south of the country. There are 24 more projects currently in the study phase at this time, while Stage II is to build power plants or to connect existing power plants with a renewable energy plant in different locations where we are operating.</p><h4>How much do you expect renewable energies to account for in the future?</h4><p>As per the regulations, we received from the regulatory authority, we have to reach at least 25% of all our capacity with renewables, meaning more than 160 MW. The Sultanate of Oman is determined to stay clean and preserve the natural environment. We know that any industrial activity could notably affect the environment, and we are trying to reduce our impact. That is why one of the objectives is to use renewable energy to reduce the emissions from our plants.</p><h4>What are the main challenges that you are facing when developing your operations?</h4><p>The country has high growth and this requires a lot of investment. A lot of infrastructure needs to be built in areas all around the country, and growing alongside that is a challenge. There is also a lack of contractors capable of carrying out some of the work, but we are trying our best to promote development in that area through working as associates or partners with those contractors.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you elaborate on the strategies that Ahlibank has adopted to deal with the economy in Oman?</h4><p>Ahlibank became a fully fledged commercial bank in 2008, prior to which it had been a purely retail housing bank. We have established a footprint of 20 branches, having set up electronic delivery channels for internet banking, both for personal and corporate customers. We also have a fully fledged business-to-business (B2B) internet banking proposition. We are about to launch mobile banking services as well. Ahlibank has been growing its assets and liabilities and retaining capital. Overall, 2013 was a landmark year for two reasons. First of all, we opened seven Al-Hilal Islamic branches, and now have the largest number of Islamic branches in the country. We also formalized a dedicated SME unit that provides both Islamic and conventional facilities. Ahlibank provides traditional working capital finance and leasing. Customer interest, particularly in our Islamic window, has been highly encouraging. Because we are growing from a relatively smaller base in the country, we grew our loan base three times faster than the sector over 2013, while deposits grew two times faster. Comparatively within the sector; therefore, we are growing rapidly, although the key consideration has been to maintain credit quality, whereby the ratio of our non-performing loans (NPLs) has remained flat at around 1%. Over and above that, it is evolving. We are constantly exploring new propositions for fresh products, particularly in Islamic banking.</p><h4>Do you anticipate launching any new projects in Oman over 2014?</h4><p>We are about to launch mobile banking applications, and also introduce an Islamic credit card. And with the increasing acceptance of Islamic products, we are set to introduce more. We were one of the first banks to launch an Islamic investment fund in 2013, called Al Hilal. It invests in Islamic operations and companies throughout the region. Perhaps one of the biggest gaps in the market right now concerns Islamic banking. We have two dedicated Islamic banks in the country and most of the other banks have set up an Islamic window, which means they conduct both conventional and Islamic business. There is significant deposit generation going on within the Islamic banking sector, but not too many opportunities to invest with Islamic compliance. Many commentators expect that the government will issue a sukuk in 2014, and that we will see some of the companies involved in major projects either issuing sukuks themselves, or else project bonds, because there is considerable liquidity that is being invested overseas that can be tapped within Oman.</p><h4>As the new CEO, what are your personal targets for 2014?</h4><p>I would say that continued sustainable growth is our aim. We want to grow the balance sheet, but we also want to keep NPLs in check. The metrics we challenge ourselves on are return on equity (ROE), return on assets (ROA), and to be best in class in terms of cost efficiency, which is currently the case. More specifically, we will build out our SME business and continue to develop our Islamic window. Meanwhile, we also want to provide our employees with the best working environment possible, and our new head office serves as a prime example. We strive to ensure that our colleagues enjoy a level playing field for career development, and we promote on merit. We want our colleagues to have meaningful, long careers with the bank and serve as ambassadors. Our focus on customer service is the overriding consideration, however, this year. I am highly optimistic about the opportunities for the banking sector in Oman as there is a stable, well-regulated economy that is open to foreign investment. There are also many expansion projects—roughly OMR10 billion worth of projects over the next five years. The Sultanate is establishing strategic logistics centers, such as Duqm and Sohar, as well as new airports, ports, and railways.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Oman Cables Industry (OCI) developed over the last few years?<br></h4><p>OCI is a young company, as are most companies in this country. We are just 30 years old. We started off as a small manufacturing outfit, and have grown year-by-year. We learned that to continue growing in this industry, you have to provide added value. From the beginning, OCI took the innovation approach, meaning we focus on creating greater value added. This is how the company got to where it is today, being one of the largest industrial companies in the Sultanate of Oman.</p><h4>What are the key drivers that are supporting your growth?</h4><p>Continuous innovation and a focus on what we call operational excellence are at the core of OCI. Of course, you also need a fundamental and robust demand for cable products. Today, we export about 60% of our production, so we are not limited to the Omani market. We manage our industrial processes in a way that we apply and deploy the best practices in all fields. We also actively support the industrialization of the country, and there are many spin-offs for the local economy. This is part of our in-country value (ICV) approach. Still, Oman needs more innovation, and Omani companies need to focus more on value added creation so as to grow and remain competitive in the global economy.</p><h4>How will the recent major infrastructure projects in Oman benefit your business?</h4><p>The infrastructure projects will benefit us greatly in general, and not only us but the whole industry and also the general economy of Oman. At OCI, we purchase a lot of materials. Perhaps around 500 containers a month arrive in the harbor here just for us, and another 600 trucks per month distribute our products. The container terminal move from Muscat to Sohar, where the facilities are much more modern, is an example of the importance of modern infrastructure. New infrastructure projects are implementing state-of-the-art systems to speed up the services.</p><h4>You recently brought online an advanced test laboratory. What is the importance of R&amp;D for Oman Cables?</h4><p>Cable manufacturing is a competitive industry. There are more than 30 cable companies in the GCC, of which we are among the biggest. Not all of those companies produce high-quality products; however, we do, and that is our advantage. Hence, to maintain our quality advantage, we need to continue innovating, which entails R&amp;D. Our cables are not a consumable product that you use and dispose of, so quality is key. Through our new test laboratory, we are assuring our clients that our cables have a long lifespan of up to 30 years. We use quality materials, machinery, and skilled workers. The fundamentals are simple; the daily routine requires a strong focus on operational excellence.</p><h4>You recently signed a contract to supply cables to Saudi Arabia. Are you very active in the GCC and the wider region?</h4><p>Oman is our domestic market, but we consider the GCC our home market. We have offices in all the GCC countries, and I require my people to understand the Saudi Arabian market as well as the Omani one. We export to all GCC countries, although the Saudi market is the largest. Our exports to these countries are balanced. Beyond the GCC, we have also decided to focus on further export markets as an area of potential market development. We are also looking into Iraq and maybe even Iran in the near future, depending on political developments.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your latest innovation in the edible oils market?<br></h4><p>In this business of oils and fats, which are basic foods, it is difficult to innovate when you consider that recipes have been handed down over the centuries, whether they are for corn oil or olive oil. However, we have made small innovations that have allowed us to increase the consumer value of palm oil; by far the largest traded oil, and at the base of the oils business. And we have invented a process by which people in the Gulf and the wider Middle East can get the benefit of that palm oil in a clear bottle without it clouding, like any other oil. Our innovation has been to bring in technology that is used for industrial frying, making it available to the consumer. We are also in the process of launching a new, completely transparent bottle of frying oil. This has been a major innovation and we are marketing this, not only though our own means, but hopefully with the help of other multinationals. We are already dealing with three of the world's largest multinationals, namely Kraft and Unilever, for fats and oils, and we work with Heinz for its mayonnaise and salad dressing.</p><h4>Are local demands evolving?</h4><p>Just like all over the world, the food market is exploding because, as prosperity rises, so too, does consumption. Oman is following the same trend and, as income levels rise, people demand higher-quality foods. Our business is to supply them with more food of healthier variety. In this tweaking process, we actually remove some of the saturated fats in palm oil so as to provide a clear liquid to the consumer. In that sense, during the innovative process, we have tried to be more socially responsible with respect to the consumer.</p><h4>What other challenges are you facing?</h4><p>The sector is open and competition is growing in global terms. And, as you know, there is a trend toward convenience foods. Our challenge is to move with this trend. The only way that I can keep up, business-wise, is to be innovative. We use cutting-edge technology in all of our systems, and work with SAP.</p><h4>How are Omani products perceived abroad?</h4><p>Getting the right perception is a challenge for an Omani brand. It becomes really difficult as you cannot swim against the tide. What we are engaged in is promotion, but only in the immediate environs of the GCC. I have no ambitions to promote further afield myself, but rather, approach multinationals better placed to do so. I am content at that point to be a link in their network chain.</p><h4>Do you have any plans for 2015 to expand your network?</h4><p>I am hoping to add one or two major multinational companies in Saudi Arabia. The brand Mazola, originally a US corn products brand which was sold to a Saudi party, is a multinational brand. I am promoting not only to the large multinationals but also to other multinational companies in the local region. And I hope to add maybe one or two in the coming years.</p><h4>How do you position your company in the long-term?</h4><p>Oman is investing in infrastructure, especially related to road and shipping. What I am doing is building my business and opening up new warehouses. We have one large one that will be on the main express road. One end of the chain is in Dubai and the other end is on the Arabian Sea, at Duqm and Muscat. We are building a huge logistics warehouse and will use the springboard that Oman provides in infrastructure to make it attractive for multinationals that we want to be in business with so they can manufacture and distribute to the Middle Eastern and African markets, or even to India, Pakistan, and the Gulf market.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the Information Technology Authority (ITA) supporting Oman's high-tech development?<br></h4><p>When you look at most of the infrastructure projects in Oman, such as the airports and ports, we can see the opportunity for ICT to play a major role. Accordingly, the ITA is responsible for the eOman strategy, which is the vehicle driving the country toward becoming a knowledge-based economy. We are an enabler for all sectors, from the government to the private sector. As an enabler, we encourage the general public to become more familiar with technology and its related services and provide opportunities for this to happen.</p><h4>Could you provide us some examples of the companies you are working with to develop and propagate ICT-based culture?</h4><p>We work with three types of companies. The first type features international collaboration from Estonia, Singapore, the UK, and the US. We have worked with United Kingdom Business Incubation (UKBI), and Coventry University to establish the Sas for Entrepreneurship Programme. In addition, the ITA is working with companies from Estonia to develop a one-stop shop for the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. The second type involves local companies, wherein many Omani companies are considered our partners in developing new ideas, again with the government and private sector in step. The third type is SMEs, where we give a lot of attention to profiling these enterprises and assuring a development plan for the SMEs to incubate them at our Sas Center. Accordingly, we target universities and colleges both public and private to introduce a pre-incubation program for all the country's young entrepreneurs. By encouraging partnerships, we want to transfer knowledge from international companies to local entities.</p><h4>You have recently activated the Sas Centre for Virtual Reality at Knowledge Oasis Muscat (KOM). Can you elaborate on the potential of this particular project?</h4><p>In terms of localizing technology in Oman, Sas enables us to bring new technologies to Oman and Sas Virtual Reality allows us to do just that. We have established a program to train three or four groups of young Omanis every quarter, totaling 120 people each year. We then take 10 to 15 of the most promising students and train them for a further six months giving them a real project to undertake. A few students have already moved on to the Sas for Entrepreneurship Programme to do such work; the goal is to create new jobs and start small businesses. Not only that, but we also foster the entrepreneurial capacity and expanding businesses through the recently inaugurated Sas virtual reality center.</p><h4>How would you rate the IT literacy level in Oman today, and what are your priorities for the future?</h4><p>IT literacy has always been part of our initiative, and I think that over the next few years, we will no longer need to pursue this activity as the public has become much more aware of technology thanks to iPads and smartphones. We provided a government training program that, over eight to 10 weeks, taught civil servants the use of diverse technologies and applications, and so far we have trained more than 75,000 people, and have less than 20,000 left to train within the scope of the program.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[let-the-data-flow]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you rate Oman's telecoms sector?<br></h4><p>I would rate it as highly competitive, both at the local level, in terms of the availability of products, services, and pricing, and also regionally and globally. That is evidenced in a number of ways. We have extensive 3G capabilities across most parts of our coverage footprint, and across Oman. We also introduced 4G technology around 18 months ago, and are continuing to expand our 4G footprint. From a technology perspective, we are well served on the national level. And, finally, I believe one of the most important statistics is our mobile penetration rate of 150%, which is high by global standards.</p><h4>Which segments of the market are you targeting to widen your own share?</h4><p>One of the key areas will be data services. That means having a broadband data capability, both at home and on your mobile phone, whatever you wish to do and wherever you are. It is a key and fundamental part of our strategy to grow our market share, and in fact, this is what customers are demanding. Then, of course, building on top of that, there are the various services or applications that drive customers' data usage. Social media is extremely popular in Oman. We have also seen high levels of usage in over-the-top (OTT) content, whether through WhatsApp, other types of instant messaging, or voice communications. Part of our strategy is to make sure that we have a widespread, capable data service available to customers, either 3G or, in the future, 4G, to meet those requirements. However, we have recognized that the market is becoming increasingly fragmented in terms of different user segments and the specific needs they have.</p><h4>What is Ooredoo doing to provide easy and efficient access to the internet?</h4><p>We have built our own fiber-optic network in the country to serve not only our own network and connect all our base stations together, but also to serve business and enterprise customers, whether the organization happens to be a company involved in oil and gas exploration and production, an SME in Muscat, or a multinational company with operations in Oman. We now have the ability to connect our own fiber network to their premises, which allows us to provide them with not only local services to connect their head offices to their branches or to their remote exploration locations, but also to their international locations. Many of the enterprises that operate in Oman are part of larger multinationals, naturally enough in the oil, gas, and exploration space, but also in the construction, imports, ports, and airports segments. Those are the three key areas of investment. To date, since we started our network “Turbocharging" program in 2012, we have invested more than OMR80 million in our network and its modernization and expansion. That represents a capital to revenue investment ratio of over 30%—more than double the global average.</p><h4>What are the main challenges and obstacles that you are facing here in the country?</h4><p>Customers are using OTT services increasingly, with WhatsApp being the best example. A company that is operating outside Oman was recently sold for a large sum with minimal investment, and this is a challenge that all operators around the world are facing. We are investing significant amounts of money to provide a capability for our customers to use telecoms services. However, we have OTT players that typically do not invest a great deal but generate, in many cases, quite significant amounts of revenue. They are therefore benefiting from the investments that we are making. Some of these overseas companies then have no local presence and so they are also exempt from local taxes or duties. That said, we believe that the market here is quite well served from a competitive perspective.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the company evolved since starting operations in 1984?<br></h4><p>We come from a mixed background, and have traveled the world to ascertain what direction other countries are heading in in terms of new technologies. That is how it all started, trying to bring to Oman what other countries had and we lacked. Back in the 1980s, the country needed almost everything, and we focused on providing whatever we could. Over time, we prioritized and channeled our business into certain segments within the IT and security sectors. We were one of the first companies to start operating in this industry in Oman, and we have been part of its expansion and evolution, which is still ongoing.</p><h4>What are the core businesses of the company?</h4><p>Passports and other security documents printing is one of our main business activities nowadays, including reading machines and issuance systems. We have developed a wide range of products dealing with document security, and over the years we have ventured into several segments of the IT sector too, such as e-payments and e-solutions. We have a strong focus on public authorities, and most of the ministries are our clients. We also have many banks among our clients, and we provide and maintain software and hardware for credit/debit card personalization, as well as e-payment methods.</p><h4>What segments do you think will drive the growth of the company in the near future?</h4><p>We have a strong focus, right now, on diversifying our business activity. We are trying to open new market niches in which we can bring something fresh and innovative. Also, we have started to export our security products and services to other governments. I think this particular business activity will play an essential role in our future development. We are extremely happy with our regional and international expansion so far and have noticed increased interest from other governments in our services as a result. We have also finalized several international partnerships in other countries. For example, we have several cooperation agreements with European and Asian companies as well.</p><h4>What are the main challenges facing the company?</h4><p>I think in the internet era people find it easy to Google information, and then they consider that they know everything. The reality is not quite like this, and we are trying to fight stereotypes that people might have about the region.</p><h4>How would you assess the sector's human resources?</h4><p>There are some challenges in finding qualified workers. However, since we have many ongoing projects and international partnerships in place, we are able to provide international training to our staff. I think this is something our employee's value greatly, and consequently we do not face the same difficulties other companies in the sector face. The training opportunities we provide to our staff are also part of our overall contribution to know-how transfer in the country.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2015?</h4><p>Based on our long experience in developing most of our products and solutions in our company, such as content management solutions, correspondence solutions, and archiving solutions that have been successfully implemented in Oman and have won prestigious awards, we are planning to promote Omani products outside of Oman. Moreover, we will continue to introduce new technologies in the security information technology field as part of our strategy and commitment toward our country.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the company's activities in five years' time?</h4><p>We see a bright future for the company, with a strong focus on international expansion and reaching new heights in terms of reputation and specialization. Expanding our international profile will mean increasing exports of our solutions and products to other countries, as we have recently done.
