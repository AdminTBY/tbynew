		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the global state of the factoring industry, and how has it responded to the global economic crisis?<br></h4><p>The global factoring industry, in stark contrast to the banking industry, has managed to pass through the crisis years very successfully. I believe that the basic elements of factoring—invoices and trade receivables—have been strong, and will remain so. The crisis presented an opportunity for factoring companies as businesses that were unable to obtain credit financing from banks found solutions amongst our products. Businesses can raise funds through factoring more easily by using their short-term receivables when it has been more difficult to access credit finance through banks. Factoring is a traditional way of financing for businesses, and more and more companies are going back to basics. The crisis offered an opportunity for a reshuffling of the finance industry, and factoring has benefitted greatly.</p><h4>How would you assess the factoring industry in Turkey?</h4><p>The factoring industry is relatively young in Turkey, having only been established around 20 years ago. We have seen a significant acceleration in growth in the last 10 years or so. In the last five years the sector began to be regulated by the banking watchdog (the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency), which has taken the industry to the next level. There are now strict requirements for reporting and auditing as well as client selection and control. This is positively affecting the quality of factoring companies and helping to improve the image of the industry, and therefore attracting more clients to our services. Factoring industry turnover reached almost $50 billion in 2010. This figure is attributable to the aggregate volume of 60+ members of the National Factoring Association of Turkey, accounting for nearly 95% of the total factoring market here. The biggest growth continues to be driven from the domestic factoring business with a transaction volume of $44 billion, representing roughly 90% of industry volume. This is mainly due to a pick-up in economic activity and high growth rate in the country's GDP.</p><div class="quote">“Factoring is an important area of finance, and we are becoming a driver of trade and industry."</div><h4>How much importance does the government attach to factoring as a driver of the country's economy?</h4><p>Factoring is an important area of finance, and we are becoming a driver of trade and industry. The development of SMEs has been highlighted by the government as vital to the future growth of the economy. Our services are tailored to SMEs, and as we lend them support we are boosting the economy and helping to drive down the unemployment rate.</p><h4>Garanti Factoring is a pioneer of the factoring industry in Turkey. What differentiates Garanti from its competitors?</h4><p>Garanti Factoring is the oldest factoring company from the first years of the industry in Turkey. Garanti already has a strong brand and is fully committed to the industry, with services available across the country using Garanti Bank' s vast local distribution channels and extensive branch network. However, the industry is still in its initial stages of development, and so the number of clients we have as an industry can be doubled every year for the next 5 to 10 years and still not be at a level seen in countries where factoring is more developed.</p><h4>A lot has changed since the early days of Garanti Factoring. What is next for the company?</h4><p>Garanti Factoring maintains its ongoing support to the real sector through its wide product suite and financial solutions to its customers, offering cash flow management through trade finance, secure sales through the credit protection of receivables, supply-chain finance both for domestic and international business, export and import products, as well as commercial collection management. With our unique innovative approach to the sector, Garanti Factoring aims to continue pioneering the offering of new initiatives in customer-driven products and solutions and making a change in the sector. The SME market is our top priority, and Garanti Factoring has successfully achieved its regional expansion of a strong sales force nationwide. Through close cooperation and synergies with the parent bank, Garanti Factoring capitalizes on Garanti Bank's commercial banking expertise and client history. Garanti Factoring is the leading import factoring company in Turkey. We work hand-in-hand with Garanti Bank to provide our services wherever they are needed. Garanti Bank can also provide us with referrals when they identify suitable clients from its portfolio. This helps us create new leads in the market.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2011</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What measures are being taken to reduce Turkey's reliance on imports and improve its export performance?</h4><p>The export volume of Turkey for January-November 2011 has increased by 20% compared to the same period in previous years, and eventually reached a level of $122.5 billion, whereas the import volume has increased by 33.5% and reached a level of $220 billion. These figures represent a trade deficit of some $97.5 billion. These figures indicate a foreign trade and current deficit problem in Turkey. This problem cannot be resolved in the short term because of cyclical and structural causes that underlie the foreign trade deficit, and thus the current deficit. The foreign trade deficit is on a rapid rise as a result of the fast increase in imports and weak domestic demand in our traditional export markets, as well as by robust domestic consumption, investment demands, and the high dependency of production on the importation of intermediate goods. However, there is no need to fear. Our government has taken and will continue to take the necessary measures. In this framework, we will continue to implement action plans for the improvement of the investment climate; resolutely fight the informal economy; complete the Strategies for the Diversification of Export-Oriented Production, Input Procurement, and Export Markets; continue to take further steps to reduce our dependence on foreign energy sources; and ensure the effective application of programs for the development of R&amp;D and innovation.</p><h4>What steps are being taken to offset the rise of iron and steel prices as a result of the depreciating lira?</h4><p>Iron and steel products may be classified among the product groups that are of the greatest importance for Turkey's exports and imports. For example, global iron and steel exports totaled $387 billion in 2010. With its iron and steel export value at $8 billion for that year, Turkey ranked 15th as a global exporter. The iron and steel import volume of Turkey is $16 billion, and Turkey ranks among the world's top six importers. Iron and steel ranks as the third largest item in Turkey's export and import mix. Iron and steel exports were valued around $10 billion and the import volume was $18 billion in 2011. These foreign trade figures show that iron and steel import and export volumes are increasing despite the depreciation of the Turkish lira. However, we never consider the growth of our foreign trade as a “finished process." On the contrary, we are currently striving to find an appropriate answer to the question of how we may further enhance our economy and trade. In this respect, increasing iron and steel prices is on the agenda of our Ministry. We aim to create a joint platform to bring together iron and steel producers, traders, and contractors to discuss existing problems. We are trying to ensure that sectoral representatives develop solutions to these issues, and these will be further discussed at a participatory platform under the coordination of our Ministry.</p><div class="quote">“Our Ministry aims to increase the efficiency of the customs offices both in respect of legislation and practice."</div><h4>How has the Ministry of Customs and Trade improved intellectual property rights laws in Turkey?</h4><p>Our Ministry aims to increase the efficiency of the customs offices both in respect of legislation and practice, with an ultimate view of preventing the breach of intellectual and industrial rights in the domain of foreign trade. In line with this aim of ours, we exhaustively amended the current legislation in 2009. Owing to the legislative amendments of October 2009 in the customs area, Turkey's current legislation became mostly harmonized with the relevant regulations of the EU. Software aimed at preserving intellectual and industrial rights was developed in October 2009. A database has been developed based on this software, and it covers the contact details and the information and illustrations relating to the comparisons of original/counterfeit products. The information and documents digitally uploaded to this database may now be rapidly and accurately accessed by all customs officials on a nationwide basis.</p><h4>What is the expected impact of the nine new border crossings with Iran, Iraq, and Georgia over next two years as well as the ro-ro Mersin-Alexandria route?</h4><p>In addition to the effectively functioning customs gates, we are planning to open one railway and two land border gates with Georgia, one land border gate with Iran, and one railway and four land border gates with Iraq. Furthermore, works initiated for the joint use of the land border gates with Georgia and Iran are still in progress. Our ultimate goal is to ensure more secure and sound foreign trade with the countries of Central Asia, the Middle East, the Caucasus, and the Gulf. However, since transportation conducted through Syria has been disrupted due to the latest developments in that country, and since costs eventually increased and a security problem arose, searches for alternative routes have begun. In this context, as a result of the new gates being opened along the borders of Iraq and Iran, we are planning to shift the Syrian trade route with the Gulf and countries of the Middle East to Iraq and Iran. However, since the establishment of such gates requires a certain amount of time, we have resorted to using the ro-ro Mersin-Alexandria route and existing Iran and Iraq gates as a short-term solution.</p><h4>What is the status of Turkey's customs borders with the EU?</h4><p>Along our European border lie the border gates of Kapí½kule, Hamzabeyli, Dereköy, ípsala, and Pazarkule. We are renovating these gates along with all border gates in Turkey. The border gates of Kapí½kule and Hamzabeyli have been renovated by the build-operate-transfer (BOT) method. Also, work on the renovation of the border gates of Dereköy, ípsala, and Pazarkule is still in progress. We have improved the quality and quantity of our current border staff. We have equipped the borders with x-ray scanning systems, radiation detector systems, and anti-drug-smuggling devices. The border gates with Europe have been designed to facilitate both rapid and secure trade.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Repsol is the largest private oil company in the country. How significant is Ecuador for the company's overall global activities?</h4><p>Ecuador is very important; we are producing on average 45,000 to 50,000 barrels per day (bbl/d) as a consortium. The consortium owns 100% of the production, and Repsol has a participation of 55% in that production. Thus, half of the volume of production I just mentioned is the net production of Repsol. According to the contract signed by Repsol in 2010, the production belongs to the state and the state pays a fixed rate to the company. That's the reason why I say that if we look at the situation in relative terms, the production that belongs to us, as Repsol, is very small for our capacity and of what we are able to manage when compared to other countries like Argentina, Venezuela, and even Bolivia, especially given the increase in gas production that the latter country is experiencing.</p><h4>For what strategic reasons does the company maintain a strong presence in Ecuador?</h4><p>Logically, we have a historic relationship with Ecuador; a relationship that nowadays is limited to the exploitation of “Block 16," but we expect that in the future new growth opportunities will become obvious. We would like to have the opportunity to develop in new regions. There are some new areas that will be bid on, and we have an interest in studying the possibility of participating, and that will come in handy with the growing investments we want to make. We also have some other areas that we wish to develop such as to the south of our block, which is a new area that we are studying in order to develop it. It's a small area, but it could prove interesting.</p><div class="quote">“We hope to be lucky in 2012 and explore areas with more potential than originally estimated."</div><h4>What's your outlook for the oil and gas sector in Ecuador over 2012?</h4><p>Fortunately, with the investments we made in 2011 and the future investments we will make until 2018, we will try to make the current production decline as harmless as possible. In 2011, we had a few wells that provided better results than were initially estimated, and that has helped us to improve initial production estimations. Exploration can be tricky, and you never know what you will find 3,000 meters underground. For that reason we hope to be lucky in 2012 and explore areas with more potential than originally estimated. We may be able to maintain or improve our current production levels.</p><h4>What is the value of the deals you have made with the government?</h4><p>The new contract of service provision signed with the government in 2010, valid until 2018, comprises a total amount of investment of $320 million. That is the amount of investment we have planned until 2018. Most of it will be used in the first three years of the project, which is when we stage the biggest drilling campaigns. We will also analyze new options. If the government opens up new areas and we are able to obtain them, then it could lead to $50 million or $60 million in additional investment.</p><h4>What challenges has Repsol faced in terms of remaining a leader in a sector crowded with foreign investors?</h4><p>As in any country, a company like ours, which is involved in the extraction of natural resources, has to make its decisions in partnership with the government. We do have a full disposition to work with the government in participating in any new event that may appear in the future, such as the new areas that may open up in the south of the country. We are studying them because they are also close to some areas in the north of Peru that we are working in. On the government side, there has to be trust in the companies that can achieve this kind of development, and it does exist. It is also present at the ministry level, where we work very closely. However, all of this depends on what conditions the government will tender these areas under. Such a close relationship with the government will allow us to continue working here successfully.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess Kazakhmys' contribution to the realization of Kazakhstan's full mining potential?</h4><p>We are currently developing two of the largest projects in Kazakhstan: Aktogay and Bozshakol. Each of these requires around $2 billion of capital investment and will increase Kazakhstan's copper output by over 50%. We will also spend some $70 million on exploration in 2011. This is probably the biggest program of its kind in the country.</p><h4>Kazakhmys decided not to issue new shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange despite the board's approval of the secondary listing. What factors have led the Group not to commit to a second listing just yet?</h4><p>We have completed our listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. At some point we would like to issue a modest amount of shares in Hong Kong, in order to assist liquidity. We believe there is good demand in Hong Kong, but these shares can only be issued at a price and valuation that makes sense to existing shareholders. We think the outlook for copper is positive, which is the main driver of our share price, and there should be an opportunity in the next 18 months.</p><h4>What is the status of the Bozshakol and Aktogay projects? What level of impact are you expecting on Kazakhmys' operations and profitability once production starts as scheduled in three to four years?</h4><p>Each of these projects represents around 100 kilotons of copper a year, compared to our current production of 300 kilotons, so it is a substantial uplift. The profitability obviously depends on metal prices at the time, but we believe they are both economically attractive projects. Bozshakol is just completing its feasibility study and should move into development at the end of 2011, with first production in 2015. Aktogay is around 12 months behind Bozshakol and should move into feasibility during 2011. Most importantly, we have $2.7 billion of funding from the China Development Bank (CDB), which will fund Bozshakol and our mid-sized projects, and we recently signed an MoU with the CDB for $1.5 billion that if completed will be used towards Aktogay.</p><div class="quote">“We think the outlook for copper is positive, which is the main driver of our share price."</div><h4>Kazakhmys has precious metal mines outside Kazakhstan. Provided the profitability of the Group and increasing commodities prices, what are your plans on expanding your operations to other geographies outside the CIS?</h4><p>We have stated that we will look at opportunities to diversify principally in Central Asia. This will be achieved through exploration and by acquiring known assets. The Central Asian region is where we can operate most comfortably, as we understand it well. It is also a vast and mineral-rich area. We will look elsewhere, but we have to be sure that we can understand and manage the risks.</p><h4>Diversification of the economy and accelerated industrialization are important agenda items for the government. How do you see processing prospects of Kazakhstan in extractive industries? What business opportunities are there for local and foreign investors?</h4><p>This is an interesting question for Kazakhmys—we are already far more involved in processing than our international peer group. We are fully integrated, so that all of the ore we mine is processed through to finished metal and around 25% is then taken further to copper rod. This is highly unusual for a major copper company. We have also worked with the government to establish the “Made in Kazakhstan" program, which aims to encourage local companies to come forward and supply materials and parts.</p><p>Kazakhstan itself has a number of key advantages for future development. The land is naturally rich in resources, with a wide range of commercially attractive deposits, and strong and reliable transport links. The country has a strong track record in attracting FDI, which has amounted to more than $120 billion since independence in 1991.</p><h4>What is the role of Kazakhmys in the satisfaction of the country's increasing need for reliable, sustainable, and environmentally friendly energy?</h4><p>Kazakhstan is currently in reasonable balance for power supply and demand, but with fast growing GDP and quite old power facilities it is critical that the country continues to invest, otherwise there will be a major shortfall in the coming years. We have four power plants—three are used mainly for our copper production, but the fourth plant is Ekibastuz GRES-1—the largest plant in Kazakhstan. Ekibastuz GRES-1 is currently undergoing a $1 billion refurbishment that will see its capacity increase by 60% in the next four years. Delivering this investment program will be critical to ensuring that the supply of power is not a restraint on economic growth</p><h4>Kazakhstan's mining sector experienced a relative contraction due to decreasing commodities prices, which was reversed in 2011. How does Kazakhmys look to take advantage of this positive trend and improving climate?</h4><p>In terms of demand, there was very little contraction in copper, and so our production did not change. Prices went down and we had to manage costs carefully, but in copper it was about margins rather than volumes. Prices have recovered, but it continues to be a matter of managing margins. As a copper mining company we cannot control end prices—we focus on managing our output and our efficiency.</p><h4>What is your business outlook for the rest of 2011? What changes in the business climate are you expecting?</h4><p>We tend to look long term—some of the assets we are developing will last 40 years, so the next six months is fairly small. In the long term, we think that the outlook for copper remains excellent; demand should remain firm and supply is always constrained. This is the decade for copper.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was behind the difficulty faced in reinvigorating the market, and how is Kazphosphate positioned today?</h4><p>After the Soviet Union collapsed the demand for products such as yellow phosphorus and fertilizers was very low. Farmers could not afford fertilizers as their priority was oil and machinery when managing their funds. Since 1999 we have been trying to focus on facilities that will have more effect. We dedicated ourselves to rehabilitating the mining industry. Along with that we have been conducting market research to identify the demand for our products. Over a 10-year time period we re-established a customer base, and now our capacity of yellow phosphorus is 120,000 tons per year, whereas exports make up to 60,000 tons per year, which is mainly consumed by our European customers. Establishing ourselves in the European market was difficult due to the breakdown of trust that occurred following the collapse of the Soviet Union. However, according to our calculations we now have approximately an 80% share of the European market for yellow phosphorus. To supply European customers we use rail deliveries; however, exports to regions such as India or other emerging markets are currently not possible due to the geographical distance between our region and the main demand markets, which consequently leads to higher logistics costs.</p><h4>What trends are you expecting in the fertilizer marketplace?</h4><p>China is the price setter, and every producer is following what is happening there. Currently, the fertilizer market is stabilizing in terms of price after the economic downturn. We now observe a solid pricing trend. Existing increases in food prices will of course impact fertilizer prices, and we can already see the evidence for prices going forward. Along with that, rising global concerns over food supply chain stability and raw material prices being on the rise will have an impact on prices. We believe that this market will continue to grow, attracting many potential investors in the coming years.</p><h4>What role can your sector play in the diversification of the economy?</h4><p>We have several investment projects associated with upgrading the quality of our products and reducing our costs. Undertaking these projects should allow us to expand our product portfolio, and therefore to offer our customers a solid range of products at competitive prices. Among other projects that our company has undertaken is the production of new phosphate derivatives for animal feed. This is a big contribution from our side for the sector, which will bring new customers and new markets to our company and therefore revenues and allocations to the state's budget. In 2013 we are planning to start the production of pesticides. This has become possible due to the local chemical industry in general developing to a point whereby both upstream and downstream production has been significantly improved. We are an innovation-minded company, and we utilize new technologies to produce products with higher value-added. To achieve our objectives in terms of higher value-added products we have set up joint ventures with international chemical companies that share their technologies and experience with us. Therefore, we are proud to state that we support Kazakhstan's chemical and agrochemical industry through innovation and cooperation with different local and international supply chain members.</p><div class="quote">“According to our calculations we now have approximately an 80% share of the European market for yellow phosphorus."</div><h4>How is Kazphosphate financed?</h4><p>Over the last decade we have proved that we are a self-sufficient company. We have a strong market share and produce sufficiently due to the diversification of our product range and the volume of exports we undertake to international markets. In terms of financing, we have two options. We acquire financing from local bodies such as Samruk-Kazyna, and we also get financial support from foreign investment institutions such as HSBC and ATF. International cooperation with chemical companies from different parts of the world as well brings additional funding.</p><h4>What opportunities do you see for foreign investors in your industry?</h4><p>The local agrochemical and chemical industries are developing well, meaning that foreign investors are focusing on this market. Along with that, they know what the investment climate in Kazakhstan is like. To be specific, we have observed interest from different companies representing states such as Russia, India, and China. Of course, this interest is focused on various areas of our industry, and we also need to consider some strategic long-term partnerships. Keeping this in mind we meet with all interested strategic investors who know that we are a company with a stable position in the phosphate sector. We perform all functions in a vertically integrated business model from exploration to the end product, and this attracts investors.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were your main goals in establishing Iskander?</h4><p>After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the exploration industry found itself in need of serious renovation. Therefore, the creation of our company met the demand at the time and, despite the considerable difficulties that occurred in its infancy, our company proved able to organize and develop its operations. Since its establishment to this day, a key principle of Iskander's strategy has been transparency and strict compliance with the laws of Kazakhstan. A strategic direction of development was chosen to attract qualified personnel, and the acquisition of drilling equipment allowed us to fulfill expectations in a professional manner. The Republic of Kazakhstan is known for its rich mineral reserves, both by their quantity and diversity. To fully realize this potential the state needs capable companies that can efficiently and competently carry out exploration work. Government policy in this area creates the most favorable environment for the creation and successful operation of mining and exploration companies such as ours.</p><h4>What are the main operations of your company?</h4><p>The main activity of GRK Iskander is exploration drilling. However, the management will make every effort to create a company that is able to carry out a full range of exploration, from surveying to the calculation of reserves, with the approval of the competent authorities. Currently, Iskander is a company with the necessary equipment and specialists. At the same time, our company has developed and is implementing a program of training skilled personnel for exploration drilling.</p><h4>How do you see Iskander contributing to the development of Kazakhstan's energy base?</h4><p>It is well known that the energy potential of any country is inseparably linked with the development of its mineral resources. As GRK Iskander is performing its activities especially in this sphere, its involvement in the development of Kazakhstan's energy potential becomes obvious.</p><div class="quote">“The Republic of Kazakhstan is known for its rich mineral reserves, both by their quantity and diversity."</div><h4>What is Iskander's level of cooperation with foreign partners?</h4><p>In our early years, we relied on cooperation with recognized global leaders in the field of exploration drilling. In this regard, GRK Iskander has the support of Boart Longyear, which enjoys wide popularity in the global market. From this company we have acquired drilling rigs, rock cutting tools, drill pipes, and other specialized equipment. In order to develop advanced drilling techniques and high performance our experts traveled to Canada, where they were directly acquainted with the working methods, production equipment, technology, and equipment in the factories and sites there.</p><h4>What does GRK Iskander's client portfolio say about its strengths?</h4><p>The fact that among our clients are major companies such as Vasilkovsky Mining and Bakyrchikskoe demonstrates the competency of our company. In general, for the entire period of its existence, GRK Iskander has had no complaints about the quality of the work performed. On the contrary, because of high work quality and positive results, we have had a lot of positive feedback and appreciation.</p><h4>What strategies did you adopt to survive the most recent economic downturn?</h4><p>In times marked by adverse economic conditions the priority of the company has been the conservation of the existing skills and capacities. At this time, we chose to take all the available projects, regardless of their size, including those that are not always known to be profitable. This helped to preserve our workforce and maintain the health of the company.</p><h4>How will the state program on economic diversification affect your company's operations?</h4><p>It is premature to predict the results of economic diversification specifically on our company. In general, we believe that government action aims at reviving the economy in general and will be objectively useful. It will not have a negative impact on the operations of successful companies such as GRK Iskander.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2011 and beyond?</h4><p>We believe and hope that we only have good prospects ahead of us, and the economy of Kazakhstan will have a positive growth trend.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the background of Borusan, and what are its core activities in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>Borusan is an international Turkish-based company. It was established 60 years ago and its original focus was on tube manufacturing. Since then the group has diversified into fields such as steel, automotive distribution, logistics, mining, and energy. Borusan operates in Turkey, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan. In Kazakhstan around 75% of our operations are in mining. A further 10% is in infrastructure construction and the distribution of Caterpillar equipment, agriculture constitutes 10%, and power systems the rest.</p><h4>How is Borusan positioned in the markets it is present in?</h4><p>We are market leaders by far in the mining sector. We are market leaders in the construction business, and in the agricultural sector we are targeting to become the market leader. We are new to the agriculture sector in Kazakhstan, having entered this business just five years ago. Kazakhstan has a huge agriculture industry—7% of GDP comes from agriculture—and we see a lot of potential. In terms of the equipment needed in that sector, it is almost equal to mining.</p><h4>How have global fluctuations affected your mining operations here in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>Our mining business was affected. However, the strength of our customer support business saw us pass through the crisis relatively well. We sell our equipment 24/7, all year round. This creates a huge market for us. We have a 40% share in mining equipment sales here in Kazakhstan, and we have a market share of 75% in product support. There may be some fluctuations in the market, but our domination of the product support sector keeps us financially profitable.</p><div class="quote">“In Kazakhstan around 75% of our operations are in mining. A further 10% is in infrastructure construction and the distribution of Caterpillar equipment."</div><h4>What is your level of interaction with the oil and gas sector in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>Chinese companies dominate the oil and gas sector in the country. There are also a lot of Western players from Italy and the US. Borusan provides engines to support drilling and marine operations. We also provide engines and generators that support the provision of electricity to isolated areas. Kazakhstan is investing a lot in oil and gas and is becoming a more and more significant global producer. It has one of the largest reserves of oil in the world, but the country is only the 19th biggest producer. This leaves a lot of room for investment, and thus creates business for us as our equipment is used in the construction of camps and oil fields.</p><h4>What potential do you see for Borusan in the construction of infrastructure?</h4><p>The Western Europe-Western China Highway is one of the biggest projects under development in 2011. The construction tenders started in 2010, one-third of the road tender has been completed, and recently another portion has been announced. In total it is going to be 8,500 kilometers long and will connect Europe to China, with 2,500 kilometers of its length passing through Kazakhstan.</p><p>There is a large Italian presence in the project, and those firms are all our customers. A lot of sub-contractors are also working on the development. The international aspect of the job means world-class equipment needs to be used. This presents us with a good opportunity to market our construction equipment. We are supplying excavators, track-type tractors, paving units, and much more. There are already several hundred pieces of Borusan equipment being used on the development of the highway.</p><h4>What other areas of the economy do you see as presenting opportunities for Borusan?</h4><p>Based on the government's 2030 strategy, Kazakhstan will become one of the world's most developed countries. To this end the government has announced plans to turn tourism into a leading sector over the next 10 years. The government is also investing in urban infrastructure like schools and hospitals, and we may have a chance to take part in these projects as well.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[quality-of-service]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the background of Mercur Auto?</h4><p>We're a 100% local private company. We started in 1994, mainly selling and servicing the Russian Lada. Since 1995 we've had a dealership contract with Volkswagen, and today our company is the official Volkswagen importer in Kazakhstan. We are also responsible for Audi, which we got in 1997, for Porsche since 2004, and Mitsubishi since 2006. In addition, we launched a joint venture for Uz-Daewoo and we operate sales as well as provide servicing and spare parts. We have three branches in Kazakhstan: in Astana, Shymkent, and Atyrau, and we have three independent dealers in Kostanay, Uralsk, and Karaganda. Our target for 2012 is to open a dealership in Aktyubinsk. The last three years were not easy for our company and for the automotive sector in general due to the crisis. However, we have invested more money in human development over this period through training, studios, and workshops. We are doing our best to become the leader in the automotive business in Kazakhstan.</p><h4>What levels of demand are you seeing?</h4><p>Volkswagen is a top-selling brand aimed at the general market, while Audi and Porsche are a more premium segment that also have substantial customers. Mitsubishi is well known in the market. For Audi and Porsche vehicles we need premium showrooms, premium gifts, and high-quality service. Volkswagen and Mitsubishi get the same treatment, but are pushed more in terms of retail as we naturally sell more of those brands.</p><h4>Are the cars you import modified to suit Kazakhstani conditions?</h4><p>Yes. The engines are modified to our fuel. To comply with European standards cars must have electronic engine management systems.</p><div class="quote">“We focus a lot on quality of service. The better you take care of your customers, the more they come back."</div><h4>For spare parts, do you provide your own logistics or do you work with logistics companies?</h4><p>We have our own logistics company called Mercur Trans, which transports cars. For spare parts we have a partnership with different logistics companies.</p><h4>Why did you opt for more premium brands like Audi and Porsche when expanding your portfolio?</h4><p>At that time only Mercedes, Volvo, and BMW were present in the premium range in our market. It was a time of economic growth and there was demand for big premium brands. The market seemed ripe for these particular brands. Audi has a superb development process and we decided we wanted to work with them. Previously the brand was ranked just above Volkswagen and a step behind Mercedes and BMW, but now it is on a par with these  luxury brands. We built a new image for Audi cars in Kazakhstan, and we have had great results. When we applied for Porsche, its managers were very surprised to learn the amount of their vehicles on Kazakhstan's roads. That's why it was decided that those cars needed servicing and spare parts. And there was a good opportunity to sell the vehicles.</p><p>We took the job on and had great success over the first couple of years, proving that it was the right move for Porsche. We were also Mitsubishi's first dealership in Kazakhstan, and we took the job on due to the existing popularity of the brand here.</p><h4>What is the market like for premium brands following the global economic crisis?</h4><p>The financial crisis affected sales, but in 2011 we expect to fully recover. In 2007 our company sold more than 5,000 cars, and getting back to these figures is our target. Mercedes and BMW are the top sellers, followed by Audi and Porsche. We believe the premium sector will grow by 30% to 40% in the next few years, and that will include growth in the sales of Audi and Porsche vehicles. In 2011 we expect to sell 80 Porsche, 140 Audi, and more than 1,000 Volkswagen units. Additionally, we would like to make Volkswagen the number one brand in the country by 2015.</p><h4>What is your strategy for the growth and development of the business?</h4><p>We focus a lot on quality of service. The better you take care of your customers, the more they come back.</p><h4>Where will the company go from here in terms of its portfolio?</h4><p>Our portfolio is set for the next two years and we don't plan further expansion in the near future. Our aim is to strengthen the brands we have now.</p><h4>What's your outlook for 2011?</h4><p>We plan to work on our partnership with Volkswagen in Russia. It will be good for our customers as there are no import duties thanks to the Customs Union. We are looking to bring in the new Passat and Jetta. Additionally, we would like to bring in the Touareg and Amarok. Besides passenger vehicles, we'll also bring in commercial vehicles.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Metro is one of the largest international trading companies in the world. What sparked the company's interest in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>Our analysis of the market here showed us the incredible potential of this country. We're very happy with how we've performed in Russia and Ukraine, and the way our concept and format has been received in the B2B community. Based on our research and experience, Kazakhstan seemed an ideal new investment destination for us. We chose Astana as our first entrance point in 2009, as the city is vibrant and growing. Almaty was as an obvious destination too. We now have five stores in four cities. We have two stores in Almaty, and one each in Astana, Karaganda, and Shymkent. Everyday we take a step forward in integrating ourselves into the community, and our commitment to Kazakhstan will be unwavering.</p><h4>What strategies are you employing to change the consumer habits of your target market, which has traditionally shopped at open-air bazaars?</h4><p>This is a common challenge, and the strategies we employ here are time tested. I was at Metro when our Russian operations began in 2001, and we were faced with the same situation. Russians would ask us how it could be better than the marketplace, where the consumer has a wide range of choices at competitive prices. So that's what we have to do in our stores—offer a wide choice of food and non-food products at comparable prices. We must be competitive in the market. It's a very simple road, but navigating it can be complicated for a new player in the industry.</p><h4>Do you believe the market has reached saturation point in terms of retailers, or is there still room for new players?</h4><p>I do not believe that the market is overcrowded yet. Kazakhstan's dynamic growth will continue to present opportunities for new players, whether domestic or international.</p><div class="quote">“Based on our research and experience, Kazakhstan seemed an ideal new investment destination for us."</div><h4>The World Bank has praised Kazakhstan as a top economic reformer. What do you believe is going to drive the country forward as a destination for foreign investment, and as a hub for the region?</h4><p>Having the World Bank praise Kazakhstan in such a way is of great significance, and I fully concur with its analysis. Kazakhstan is a superb place to invest. Furthermore, the Customs Union between Kazakhstan, Russia, and Belarus is accelerating Kazakhstan's aim to be a hub in Eurasia. For us this is incredibly important, because building on the success we have had in Russia with our business model will become even easier when the union comes into effect and the borders between the three countries effectively dissolve. It will allow us access to a wider range of products and better conditions that will eventually work to the benefit of our customers in terms of the choice we will be able to offer them.</p><h4>What percentage of your products is supplied locally?</h4><p>We have about 300 suppliers, with 90% of our products being supplied by local players and stakeholders. This converts into around 30% to 40% of our sales revenue. Our local producers are concentrated in the fresh foods area, such as dairy, meat, and vegetables.</p><h4>Since entering the market, what positive changes have you noticed and helped to effect among local producers?</h4><p>We have seen positive improvements in supply chain efficiency and packaging. We also work closely with suppliers to upgrade and maintain sanitary conditions. This improvement is also appreciated by the government as it raises the overall quality of the industry. This is a relatively small market of 16 million people. But with the Customs Union, we also offer direct consulting, a system in which we help suppliers improve their product for our stores, which then raises them to the standard at which they can also export to Russia and numerous other countries, whether it's through Metro or other chains.</p><h4>Which Kazakhstani products do you believe have the potential to be marketed more extensively on the world stage?</h4><p>Kazakhstan's strength lies in its production of grain products, like wheat and flour, or foodstuffs such as macaroni and pasta, as well as meat. Through Metro, Kazakhstani meat producers are selling in our stores in Russia. We're focusing on meat and grain products for the time being. The grain is high quality, and the industry will only continue to grow and yield greater overall export value.</p><h4>How do you see the wholesale retail market evolving as the economy picks up following the global economic downturn?</h4><p>Its growth will contribute substantially to economic recovery. We believe that a rising tide lifts all boats, and the recovery process will make the retail market here much more attractive. We will also see more international players enter the market in the coming years. The market is dynamic, young, growing, and increasingly wealthy. I believe this is only the beginning, and Kazakhstan will continue to offer superb opportunities for Metro.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Galanz Bottlers JSC was established in 1998, specializing in the production of bottled table water and soft drinks. Why did you decide to enter this sector?</h4><p>Initially I thought that it was not complicated to produce soft drinks and beverages. Firstly, we started to produce water in five-gallon amounts. There was nothing complicated, it was a very straight decision process. We bought 100 bottles and a cleaning and filtering machine that could process 200 liters per hour. We rented the facilities, and our business was worth around $15,000. At the time bottled water was very expensive, and we were not the first to enter the market. I was interested in the production process itself, not in sales. To increase the bottled water-consuming segment we followed some marketing strategies. Tap water is not really clean and there are chemicals in it. It leaves a residue in teapots, and our water did not leave such residues. Our marketing strategy was to show people that they would have that residue in their stomachs if they consumed tap water, and no such thing would happen with our water. Kazakhstan is a tea drinking society. We offered our potential consumers two cups of tea—one cup was made with tap water and another with our water. Consumers found the tea made with our water tasted better. It smelled more natural. People started to understand which water was better and became increasingly interested in our water. Also, we distributed it for free. We would give this water free of charge to use for two weeks. Around 60-70% of this initial group continued using our water, and by word of mouth our client base increased.</p><h4>How has your company evolved? Why did you decide to get into the beverage business?</h4><p>It was back in 2003 that we moved into other beverages. In 1998 I started this company all alone, and by 1999 I already had 100 employees. Now it is 1,200 employees strong. At that time I travelled with my wife to China quite often. She was busy in the education field, and I went along to assist her. In China we very much liked bottled iced tea. There we came up with the idea to produce iced tea here in Kazakhstan. At that time there was no other producer and it was all imported from Turkey, the US, and other countries. We were the first to produce here locally. We found the equipment manufacturer and the product in China, and in mid-2004 we shipped the first bottle of Maxi Chay.</p><h4>Does your large market share depend on marketing, keen pricing, or on quality?</h4><p>It depends firstly on the taste. We can right now go to the shop and buy another product and strip off all the branding and perform a taste test, and you would still choose our product. Second is, of course, the price, and that is why we have a 40% market share.</p><div class="quote">“We can right now go to the shop and buy another product and strip off all the branding and perform a taste test, and you would still choose our product."</div><h4>Are there any unique aspects to the tastes of local consumers?</h4><p>It is difficult to speak for the entire nation. Children like sweet tastes, while adults do not prefer such sweetness. We have two targets: children and adults. We do not want to lose one while focusing on the other. That is why we have decided to put sugar at no more than 8% per liter. We also work in Afghanistan and North Africa, and there people prefer 12%-13% sugar.</p><h4>You have launched a wide array of products, including energy drinks. Before launching a new product what strategies do you follow?</h4><p>We conduct market research and think about our competitors. That is why we have original energy drinks as well as drinks that are not very different from our competitors in the market. We like to try tastes. Before the production process we perform focus group evaluations and taste tests.</p><h4>How has the formation of the Customs Union between Kazakhstan, Belarus, and Russia influenced your business?</h4><p>We are working in Almaty only with one distributor, and that company is responsible for most of our distribution. In Almaty, we perform 70% of the distribution ourselves. In other cities we outsource it. But in each of the 19 regions outside Almaty our employees oversee distribution. Around 30% of all our sales are in Almaty, with almost all of the rest going to other regions. In 2011 we are planning to produce 52 million liters, and export 5%-6% of that amount to Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, and Russia directly. We also export to Afghanistan and Libya through our partners. The Customs Union is a complicated question. The Russian market is not a part of our strategy for now. Our Russian competitors are stronger, richer, and have a larger production base. Politically speaking, the Customs Union was the right decision made by Kazakhstan's government. Whether in the Soviet era or even today, Russia was our main trading partner, yet it is clear that some businesses will suffer. Some mergers will take place, and some will go out of business.</p><h4>What is your vision for Galanz Bottlers over the coming five years?</h4><p>We would like to put our accounting side in order, and make everything clear and transparent on that side of the business. We also need to think about our means of distribution. We would like to launch new beverages and sell them. The beverage market does not stay the same, and we need to keep up with it. We would also like to produce dairy-based products. Furthermore, we are interested in the production of Chinese-style instant noodles. The main philosophy of the company is not to produce products that are harmful to health, like cigarettes or alcoholic beverages. To implement our expansion agenda we are open to partnerships as well. We are trying to be as open and transparent as possible to attract investors that might be interested in becoming stakeholders in our company. Kazakhstan imports more than 30% of its food needs from Russia, Europe, and China. If we could work a little more in our country, then business could be very profitable in the agriculture sector, food market, and other sectors.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Cameco is one of the world's largest uranium producers, roughly accounting for 16% of global production. How has your business evolved since your entry into the Kazakhstani market?</h4><p>In its early years as a publicly traded company, Cameco's uranium production was centered in Canada. Right after Kazakhstan gained its independence Cameco was one of the first to recognize Kazakhstan's huge potential for uranium production, although the full extent of that potential was not known at the time. We saw potential early on that, by producing in Kazakhstan, we could diversify our production base, which is a value to our customers as production risk is spread over several production centers in different countries. The first visit by Cameco to Kazakhstan took place in 1992, and early exploration and development work led to the formation of the joint venture Inkai between Cameco and Kazatomprom in 1996. In 1999 our joint venture received a license and in 2000 signed the sub-soil use contract to develop the significant uranium deposit at Inkai. Now, more than a decade later, Inkai is taking its place as an important production center for both companies, producing over 1,600 metric tons of uranium (MtU) in 2010. We have promoted Inkai as a success story through the President's Foreign Investment Council. Opening our office in Astana in 2010, in addition to the long-established JV Inkai offices in Almaty and Taikonur, shows action on our commitment to Kazakhstan. Cameco's growth strategy is to double its annual uranium production to 40 million pounds by 2018 and Inkai is a key component of our plan. We value our relationships with Kazatomprom and the Kazakhstani government and are pleased to be a partner in establishing this region as a sustainable, reliable uranium production center for the long term.</p><h4>How has the Cameco culture contributed to the development of Kazakhstan's energy potential?</h4><p>Cameco has extensive experience and expertise to share with its Kazakhstani partner to operate uranium mines to the highest environmental and worker health and safety standards. We can also offer access to our proprietary refining and conversion technology. One of the key strategic goals of our partner Kazatomprom is to build a vertically integrated company with capabilities in mining, conversion, enrichment, and fuel fabrication. We, as a partner, can support Kazatomprom to achieve its strategic goal. Cameco, with its strong financial position, also brings direct foreign financing to the country, and we were responsible for financing the initial capital costs of Inkai.</p><h4>President Nazarbayev has expressed Kazakhstan's will to host a nuclear fuel bank. How realistic is it that the country will produce fuel and become the center of the global fuel trade?</h4><p>President Nazarbayev is a well-recognized international leader with a very strong agenda for nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear safety. Since its independence, Kazakhstan has consistently proven its commitment to nuclear non-proliferation and has many of the supporting factors to accommodate and host a nuclear fuel bank if and when it is created by the international community. As part of its strategic goals, Kazatomprom is working to build its own fuel fabrication capability in Kazakhstan.</p><div class="quote">“Cameco's growth strategy is to double its annual uranium production to 40 million pounds by 2018."</div><h4>How do you see Kazakhstan's agenda for power generation via nuclear power plants?</h4><p>Most of the growing world demand for power is coming from emerging economies. That is why we share a strong view of the future of the nuclear industry as one of the key elements of the overall energy mix. Early discussions are ongoing at the government level to build a nuclear power plant in Kazakhstan, and safety is obviously an important part of that discussion, especially after the events at Fukushima. Kazakhstan can have nuclear energy in its overall energy mix in the long-term perspective.</p><h4>How do you see the interplay of the political will and the legal framework? What steps can be taken to carry the nuclear agenda forward?</h4><p>Although oil and gas are a big part of the Kazakhstani economy, Kazakhstan's uranium sector is a much bigger part of the world's nuclear industry. The government understands its leading role in the sector ,and we expect Kazakhstan to become an even bigger part of the world nuclear industry. Kazakhstan has an open economy that is mostly driven by commodities. There is a strong desire to diversify the economy, plans to improve the business environment and invest in infrastructure, and an understanding of the importance of foreign investments.</p><h4>What is your outlook with respect to supply and demand for nuclear fuel in the post-Fukushima world?</h4><p>Each form of power generation, be it nuclear, coal, or gas, has its own safety challenges. The nuclear industry worldwide, and in Kazakhstan, has a very strong safety culture. After Fukushima we expect that newly constructed nuclear plants will go through even more rigorous safety reviews by regulators. Nuclear will continue to be a part of the energy mix as it's clean, economically viable, and the industry is much better and experienced now at running nuclear power plants. We believe that  the long-term demand for nuclear energy will not be affected by the events at Fukushima in any major way.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main characteristics of Kazakhstan's new industrial policy?<br></h4><p>The global economic crisis has shown that the high-tech processing industry constitutes the most profitable investment for private domestic capital, as it guarantees a stable economy. Through unprecedented measures to support domestic producers and through the implementation of an effective crisis management program, the government managed to mitigate the crisis and minimized its effects.</p><p>At this moment of revival and expansion, President Nazarbayev has articulated the principles of economic development. His ideas are the basis for the state program of accelerated industrial-innovative development. Under this program, government efforts have focused on developing several priority areas. First of all, it has focused on traditional industries, such as oil and gas, mining and metallurgy, nuclear, and the chemical industry, followed by the transition from primary production to higher value-added products. The second segment is that of companies serving sub-soil users, domestic companies, and the state as a whole. Such areas of activity encompass engineering, construction, building materials, and pharmaceuticals. The third direction is export-oriented production, such as agriculture, light industry, and tourism. And the fourth group—the economy of the future—refers to areas that will play a dominant role in the global economy over the next 15 to 20 years, such as ICT, biotechnology, alternative energy, and space-related industries. In 2010-2011, all traditional industries experienced a rise compared to previous years.</p><p>For the development of priority sectors of the economy, the government is providing a comprehensive support program for business. Thus, the Business Road Map 2020, aimed at developing entrepreneurship in the target spheres, provides interest rate subsidies and loan guarantees. Another program aimed at increasing the productivity of existing enterprises and the creation of new high-tech industries is “Performance 2020". “Investor 2020" is a support and encouragement program aimed at creating an enabling environment for FDI in non-primary sectors of the economy. “Export 2020", on the other hand, is being utilized to promote domestic products on foreign markets. Moreover, attention is focused not only on the major players, but also on the activity of SMEs.</p><div class="quote">“FDI inflows into the country in 2010 amounted to $10 billion, and in the first quarter of 2011 the economy brought in an additional $3.2 billion."</div><h4>In which export-oriented sectors do you see investment and partnership opportunities?</h4><p>Any area in Kazakhstan's industrial base, whether it's textiles or petrochemicals, has great potential for development. The investment policy of Kazakhstan in the sphere of sub-soil use has undergone some changes in light of the goals and objectives the accelerated innovative industrialization program has set. The new formula of cooperation is defined by sub-soil use in exchange for investment, new technology, and higher productivity. Kazakhstan will not agree with the previous/usual mechanism regarding the production and export of raw materials or concentrates. Access to sub-soil deposits will be provided only if it involves the complex processing of raw materials, access to subsequent processing, and partnership with Kazakhstani producers of goods and services. This is the usual practice worldwide. The key mechanism for implementing the state program is the Industrialization Map, which includes all the significant projects in Kazakhstan's economy. Particular importance is attached to the implementation of niche projects that involve production that have not yet been established in Kazakhstan. So far, we have identified more than 80 niche projects involving the production of more than 400 products worth over $40 billion. For example, in mining and metallurgy, niche steel projects include the production of special steel and other related products, such as pipes, profile products with increased strength, ferro-alloys, and polycrystalline silicon. In non-ferrous metallurgy, attractive areas include the production of rolled steel products and aluminum, zinc, copper, gold refining, and rare metals for redistribution. Projects in the mining and metallurgical complex must be at least $5 billion in size. As for the chemicals industry, some of the most promising areas include the establishment of gas processing facilities and petrochemical plants for the production of fertilizers, concentrated soda, methanol, ammonia, urea, and sulfuric acid. According to preliminary estimates, the realization of these projects requires at least $6 billion. Engineering is of particular interest to foreign investors. The market size is more than $13 billion, and machinery and equipment imports account for 85% of total imports. In this industry, priority is given to the production of agricultural machinery (tractors and related equipment), railway engineering (passenger and freight cars, solid-rolled wheel sets), as well as the automotive industry (passenger cars and commercial vehicles). In the construction industry, in which 43% of building materials are imported, promising areas include the production of glass, ceramic products, basalt fibers, industrial construction materials, and clinker cement terminals. The implementation of such projects requires at least $600 million. And this is just a small part of the identified industry niches that need foreign investment, equipment, and technology.</p><h4>What advantages does Kazakhstan have when trying to attract investors, and how can the numbers be increased?</h4><p>Our main advantage is the solid investment climate, which is characterized by a number of positive aspects. First of all, according to scientific estimates, Kazakhstan ranks sixth in the world in terms of natural resource reserves. In general, our country has more than 5,000 open but undeveloped mineral deposits, of which only 280 are oil and gas. Secondly, Kazakhstan has a favorable geopolitical position, which provides investors with a consumer market of almost half a billion people in Central Asia, China, and Russia. And finally, the business climate is supported by favorable investment laws and attractive measures tailored with a view to support investment and economic and political stability. Kazakhstan today holds a leading position in the region as an investment destination. Stable macroeconomic conditions in the country allow Kazakhstan to be one of the most attractive countries for foreign investors. According to the National Bank of Kazakhstan, FDI inflows into the country in 2010 amounted to $10 billion, and in the first quarter of 2011 the economy brought in an additional $3.2 billion. Based on earlier data, it is noted that from 1993 to 2010, Kazakhstan's economy attracted $126.6 billion, primarily from European investors. In 2010, growth in investment in the non-primary sectors of the economy amounted to 21.6% and exceeded the growth rate of investments in the mining and oil and gas industries (12.6%).</p><h4>What are some highlights from your work on improving the investment climate in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>We conducted a large-scale project that primarily focused on the legislative framework. The law on investments in its current form provides full protection for investors. According to international experts, it meets all standards for international investment legislation practices. In addition, Kazakhstan signed the Agreement on the Mutual Promotion and Protection of Investments with 44 countries and one agreement within the framework of the Eurasian Economic Community, which provides additional safeguards to protect investors' rights, in particular: protection from discrimination, requisition and nationalization, and the right to resolve investment disputes at international arbitration courts in the absence of an arbitration agreement. For investment projects in priority sectors of the economy, there are investment preferences. In particular, the law on investments provides for the exemption from customs duties on goods, equipment, and components imported for investment projects and offers state grants. On January 1, 2009 we enacted a new tax code that significantly reduces the tax burden in the non-commodity sectors of the economy. It should be noted that in 2009 the corporate income tax rate was reduced from 30% to 20%, and by 2014 will be set to 15%. For SMEs, this removes the requirement for the advanced payment of corporate income tax. It also reduces the tax base for the payment of property tax. Also, among other incentives, the new tax code will see the value-added tax rate fall from 13% to 12%.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What can be done to increase the attractiveness of the insurance sector in Lebanon?<br></h4><p>Recruitment is key. This has been a tough issue for us, as it is now harder to convince young Lebanese to stay in the country when they can often make better wages in countries in the Gulf and Saudi Arabia. We are now going in for more female employees, as they tend not to go abroad. Women tend to be more conscientious on the job, and have more loyalty because they are not interested in living abroad. If we can raise the quality of our employees through continuous training, then we can hope to improve the image of the insurance industry across the country.</p><h4>What is the history of the company?</h4><p>We have grown from a very small company into a leader in the insurance industry. We are probably the only insurance company among the top six or seven that isn't owned or associated with a bank. We depend on our insurance agents and our sales people. We have an exclusive 400 insurance agents and around 100 brokers working with us. Our operations are really diversified because our production comes from a lot of people who aren't dominated by a big broker. The biggest company in Lebanon now produces around $100 million of premiums a year. About 50% or 60% of that comes from syndicates of lawyers, doctors, engineers, and so on. We are more specialized in personal business. We have very few people who produce a million dollars in premium income. The $55 million that we expect to close with in 2011 will come from around 500 people. This is very positive on the risk front, because if you are a very small insurance company with one or two brokers who generate 50% of the premium, that one or two people can then impose their opinion and policy on the company. If they then leave the company, that company will be in trouble or go bankrupt. We also don't push for really big business. We mainly target the retail level. Something like 20% or 25% of business is at the corporate level and 75% is personal, like car, medical, life, personal accident, marine cargo, and home insurance. In this line of business there isn't much competition. Taking on small business means more profitability, but having more leverage on the premium. This requires employing more people, who will raise our overheads a bit, but allow us to hire even more.</p><h4>Would you say there's less competition on the personal level?</h4><p>Usually a big broker would not bother looking at your car, which would cost between $150 and $500 to insure. He'll say it's too small. But the junior will go for it without any hesitation. If you have a lot of juniors it becomes very interesting because you are diversifying the business and getting a better profit margin. However, you will be spending more money on issuing policies and printing policies and need more staff in order to cater for this large number. We have 100,000 policy owners. That's a lot of people. We have 60,000 cars insured with us. I think we might be one of the few insurance companies with the biggest number of policy owners and cars insured.</p><div class="quote">“We have grown from a very small company into a leader in the insurance industry."</div><h4>What are your long-term goals for Fidelity?</h4><p>Actually, we'd be interested in expanding outside Lebanon in the region. We also might have an appetite for a joint venture with an international company. My two children help me run the company. My son is general manager and my daughter is in charge of administration and human resources. We have a lot of ambitions for Fidelity.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What will be some of the main trends in the telecoms sector over 2012?</h4><p>In Ecuador, we are facing many challenges. Nowadays, the central issue is broadband, as it is where we see the biggest opportunity for growth in the next few years. We are also going to see additional services allowing providers to reach clients using the convergence of multiple services that are currently sold separately. That's the essential issue in telecoms. If we look at the numbers, Ecuador started 2007/08 with 160,000 broadband ports. The expectation is that by the end of 2013, we will have around 900,000, to which we can add wireless connections from mobile operators. We hope mobile broadband penetration rates will increase with more strength and better quality with cutting edge technology as well. Currently, the broadband service on offer is not very wide and its quality varies because of spectrum limitations.</p><h4>What are the main challenges to providing better broadband services?</h4><p>The challenge in developing broadband connectivity is breaking the vicious circle. Demand doesn't grow because it is still costly and prices don't go down. In order break this up, it will be necessary for one of the operators to launch a very attractive promotion in the market. In this way, it will be able to capture a good number of clients and generate a virtuous circle that increases demand rapidly and makes prices go down. In fact, the arrival of new elements to compete in the market and access to systems based on IP present a challenge for established operators with traditional technology to rethink their business and increase client trust.</p><div class="quote">“The challenge in developing broadband connectivity is breaking the vicious circle."</div><h4>How would you evaluate the level of competition in the telecoms sector?</h4><p>In mobile telecoms, there are three operators. The primary is Conecel, which holds almost a 70% market share and its brand is Claro. On the other hand, Otecel, which belongs to Telefonica, and is sold as Movistar, holds just over 28%. Finally, CNT holds just under 2% and is sold as Alegro. Ecuador has a mobile penetration rate of more than 100%. Although the number of mobile devices surpasses the population, the figure is skewed as some people have more than one line. On the other hand, landline telephony is headed by CNT, the state operator, which has more than 2.1 million lines. CNT holds around 92% of the market. ETAPA, municipally owned by the city of Cuenca, holds around 5%, and the rest is distributed among seven operators. Regarding internet, around one-third of the population has access to this service and CNT is the provider of just over 20% of the market, although CNT had only 9% of the market in 2008. We can conclude there has been significant growth, but it is still not enough. The provision of portability services for data transmission, which is done through the fiber-optic network, is managed by CNT. However, Telconet, another competitor, has experienced growth as well. This company provides corporate services to several important companies in Ecuador. To summarize it, the limitation in the past was international access to the internet; however, because of investments made by Telefonica International Wholesale Services and CNT, broadband has expanded and we have more access in urban zones, although this capacity will be underestimated again if Ecuadoreans require more services with wider bandwidth.</p><h4>Ecuador has adopted the Japanese-Brazilian standard model for digital TV. What are the prospects for reducing the digital gap?</h4><p>Television is present in 84% of Ecuadorean homes. By definition, terrestrial television is a free service and the government does not have any intention to make digital television subscription based or paid. The intention is to reach most of the population and to incorporate that remaining percentage that does not have access to TV. It implies making the most of the versatility that the system has to generate applications that allow people to reduce the digital divide. The Superintendence is working on producing digital content and we are certain that there is great potential in Ecuador in terms of content production by the private and public sector. I believe there are a lot of people with great creativity and skills who can develop software and applications online, and reduce the technology gap. However, we would like to encourage this human resource one step further. To achieve this, we will need to change programs at universities so college students can graduate prepared. There must be also new criteria to make the viewer loyal to the program he likes. Also, we have to educate the owners of broadcasting stations in order to explain the realities of the modern age, as opposed to the situation of radio 40 to 50 years ago in which still remain many of them. Nowadays, it is also necessary for the government to invest in the provision of services and networks in order to develop quality not only with technology but also with excellent content.</p><h4>What role are you going to play in the implementation of the new “mobile wallet" service?</h4><p>We are responsible for ensuring that transactions over the networks are safe, to avoid fraud, identity theft, and risk. SUPERTEL's new project for 2012 is the development of a computer incident response center (CERT). Our intention is to avoid fraud, not only relating to money transfers but also identity theft, hacking, and incidents and vulnerabilities on networks. This is the role we will play in the development of the mobile wallet. We have to highlight that we have not experienced many problems with those issues in Ecuador as yet.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Tengizchevroil (TCO) is Kazakhstan's biggest crude oil producer. How would you describe TCO's growth in Kazakhstan and its contribution to the country's full energy potential?<br></h4><p>We are very proud of having increased production from approximately 1 million to almost 26 million tons per year since our inception in 1993. What has contributed to our growth and where we believe we contribute the most to Kazakhstan's full potential is simple: investment in people and technology.</p><h4>What are TCO's plans for continued growth?</h4><p>TCO is dedicated to increasing production, jobs, and opportunities for businesses to the benefit of Kazakhstan through continued growth of the Tengiz field. With the success of our recent expansion, we are studying further similar growth opportunities for Tengiz. We have proposed an expansion opportunity based on the successes of the last expansion that could add further value to Kazakhstan and its citizens through jobs, business opportunities, revenues to Kazakhstan, and reserves growth. The project could move into detailed design and construction after receiving the necessary approvals from the appropriate regulatory authorities and TCO's partner companies.</p><p>A good example of how major projects such as expansions impact the Kazakhstani economy is our most recent, the Second Generation Plant expansion. Throughout that expansion, TCO invested about $2 billion in Kazakhstani goods and services with more than 200 companies and utilized tens of thousands of workers.</p><div class="quote">“Kazakhstan is uniquely situated between several growing regions that will need vast amounts of different energy sources."</div><h4>How should new transport links be designed to improve Kazakhstan's ability to meet the increasing demand from neighboring geographies?</h4><p>As a responsible operator, we maintain a diverse portfolio of export capacity and have always encouraged the creation of new routes or expansions to existing ones.</p><h4>How do you see the future of Kazakhstan as an energy provider to Western and Eastern markets?</h4><p>Kazakhstan is uniquely situated between several growing regions that will need vast amounts of different energy sources to support the needs of their populations and to progress their growth plans. In addition, Kazakhstan continues to demonstrate strong growth, which will surely mean increased domestic energy needs. This increased demand, of course, is considered in our plans for continued growth and world-class reliability.</p><h4>What improvements have you observed in the oil and gas sector with regard to rules and regulations? Where do you see room for further progress?</h4><p>The leaders of Kazakhstan have a long track record of being committed to ensuring a stable and attractive investment climate.  Recently, we have been pleased with increased transparency and dialogue with stakeholders in the formation of laws and regulations that are based on the long-term vision of being a good place for domestic and foreign investors.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2011 and beyond?</h4><p>We are enjoying a very strong year in safety, environmental protection, and production. One of the clearest indicators of our production and financial success is what we are able to deliver back to Kazakhstan, thanks to strong crude oil prices. As of June 2011, TCO has made direct financial payments of $52.4 billion to Kazakhstani entities, including profit distributions to Kazakhstani shareholders, and taxes and royalties paid to the government. In the first half of 2011, direct payments to Kazakhstan totaled $7 billion, compared to $9.6 billion in total payments for 2010.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>BG Group has been active in Kazakhstan for nearly 20 years. How would you describe BG's contribution to the realization of the country's full energy potential?<br></h4><p>BG has been operating in the country since 1992. Our current focus is the Karachaganak field. We are a joint operator in Karachaganak with ENI, and it is the biggest gas condensate field. Chevron and Lukoil have also joined. We have significantly developed the field, forging technology and foreign expertise. This has been a very successful project, and it has performed extremely well not only in terms of production, but also in terms of safety and profit generation. It is a major impetus for the economy with many positive impacts.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the maturity levels of the field?</h4><p>There is a lot of development to go, and we are still in a major investment phase. So far only 10% of the hydrocarbons have been produced. To develop the field optimally we have been engaged in strong and cooperative discussions with the government.</p><h4>In 2009 the shareholders in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) agreed to expand the pipeline's capacity. What implications does this have for your plans in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>It has been a long and hard process, but we have made a good level of progress on that front. It has taken six years to bring it to where it is now. It is an important project for Russia, Kazakhstan, and BG Group. It constitutes a huge step for Kazakhstan with regard to gaining access to world markets. It also is an important part of Kazakhstan's energy jigsaw. It will bring in additional demand for Karachaganak, facilitating the realization of the field's full potential. CPC as it is now is already very important, as a lot of Kazakhstan's wealth is passing through it.</p><h4>Kazakhstan is a producer and a transit country at the same time. What is your vision for Kazakhstan emerging as the region's energy hub?</h4><p>Kazakhstan is already an energy hub for the region. Any enhancement of its position as an energy hub depends to some extent on additional gas infrastructure, which is tied to the enactment of new legislation. In any case, Kazakhstan is well positioned to play an increasingly more important role.</p><h4>What are your long-term objectives for BG Group in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>The long-term objective is to continue our focus on Karachaganak. We are ready to invest there under the right terms and conditions. We are also looking at other projects in Kazakhstan. We are also interested in other countries such as Turkmenistan. Our aim is to increase our number of local employees to 80%, making this a fully Kazakhstani firm. With regard to expertise, education, and training in Kazakhstan, we try to develop it as fast as the sector and business can accommodate, so that new graduates can take over roles in our businesses. We cannot develop without developing the local economy. Our efforts have been reflected in our performance and reputation. The American Chamber of Commerce honored BG as the best foreign investor in Kazakhstan, and we have also received praise for our environmentally conscious business approach.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Exterran's background story to being in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>We've been in the Kazakhstani market for more than three years. Before 2008 the company was called Hanover Kazakhstan, and after May 2008 it became Exterran Kazakhstan. Exterran is a Houston-based company that was itself the product of a merger between two companies: Compressor Solution and Hanover. They united to form Exterran.</p><h4>What opportunities did Exterran identify when it entered Kazakhstan in 2008?</h4><p>There are a lot of opportunities here for Exterran. The President, Nursultan Nazarbayev, has strongly promoted the utilization and production of natural gas, and our equipment is perfectly suited to the small gas fields present in the country. Therefore, Kazakhstan was an obvious investment opportunity for Exterran. For a long time we were alone in the sector, but there are now competitors from Europe and Russia. Nevertheless, we remain the leaders.</p><h4>What is your business strategy?</h4><p>We have been the dealers and distributors of well-known companies like Caterpillar, Ariel, and Waukesha. We buy their equipment, install it on our skids, and then sell them on to our clients.</p><div class="quote">“The level of industry in Kazakhstan is definitely on the up, and this trend will continue to be a boon to Exterran."</div><h4>Your company has a comprehensive product portfolio in oil and gas production. Which of your products is most in demand in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>We design gas plants and manufacture and produce vessels, tanks, pumps, compressors, and basically all the equipment on skids. Exterran manufactures vessels, pipelines, and tanks in Dubai then imports them here. Equipment like compressors, pumps, and gas motors are shipped here from the US. We install equipment on the skids in Houston, and then send them to Kazakhstan along with motor compressors.</p><h4>Do you have training or maintenance services?</h4><p>Yes, we have an aftermarket service in Kazakhstan. We also do pre-commissioning, commissioning, decommissioning, and start-up. We also do maintenance. For example, we now have one project in the Uralsk region where we are building a gas plant. Our duties include pre-commissioning, commissioning, start-up, and later the operation and maintenance of the plant. We also operated another plant in the Turgay region for three months.</p><h4>Are you looking for more partnerships with international or Kazakhstani companies?</h4><p>We have been involved in a local project in which we collaborated with local companies as well as with our Exterran specialists in Dubai. That was in the commissioning stage. In the operation stage we will use expatriates only for key positions, with the rest of the positions to be filled by local employees.</p><h4>What do you think is the role of Exterran in terms of developing the full potential of the oil and gas sector in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>We are going to train local employees, and in about six months to a year we will replace our expatriate labor force. It will be both cheaper for our company and a benefit for Kazakhstan. We are also going to train client employees, because they currently lack the skills required for this new sector.</p><h4>What impact will your cooperation with Chinese National Petroleum Company (CNPC) have on Kazakhstan?</h4><p>We just recently began working with CNPC. We installed more than 20 compressors in the field, working closely with both Chinese and local employees. We trained local employees, and took care of the commissioning and start-up, and after the start-up we even provided them with aftermarket service for a short period. Now, we've begun building new units with five specialists on the site, working closely with CNPC to install 10 more compressors.</p><h4>Both Western and Chinese energy companies are active in Kazakhstan. Is Exterran focused mainly on new Chinese entrants to the market, or do you also work closely with Western companies?</h4><p>Exterran has an office in China, and we have very good relations with the country. Our aim, however, is to have great relationships with all our clients, be they Chinese or other.</p><h4>In addition to your activities in Uralsk and the North Caspian, do you have other major projects lined up?</h4><p>We have a project in Aktyubinsk, which will be slightly bigger than our plant in Uralsk. We should be starting that project in either February or March 2012. We've already shipped equipment there and we will start the installation and commissioning process. We also have another project in Aktau, near the Caspian Sea. The plant has been started up, and we repaired one of the compressors for them as well, for which our client was very pleased.</p><h4>What's your outlook for the Kazakhstani economy in 2011?</h4><p>The level of industry in Kazakhstan is definitely on the up, and this trend will continue to be a boon to Exterran. Metallurgy, oil and gas, agriculture, and agri-business are growing particularly quickly.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the strengths and prospects of the bank?</h4><p>We were well positioned going into the global economic crisis. Even though we weren't in the top five banks coming into the crisis, we were presented with a fairly significant opportunity, as we didn't have the losses, problems, and foreign borrowings that other Kazakhstani banks had. This meant we were able to avoid the major restructuring challenges many banks faced. We currently have no financial issues. In fact, we're one of the strongest banks in the country. We're also part of a very significant faction in terms of the Eurasian group in general. Our main challenge now is to take advantage of that position. We are working to develop a properly operating institution under the best practices. From an opportunity standpoint, it's a very nice situation being in the middle of a country with reasonably significant growth compared to its peers or compared to other countries in the world.</p><h4>Could you elaborate on the key measures that the bank's management team took to ensure operational stability throughout the crisis?</h4><p>There are a few things that happen in a crisis that one has to be concerned about. One is liquidity, or the lack thereof. Another aspect is what to do regarding asset quality while maintaining overall profitability and capital adequacy. There weren't any liquidity issues. In fact, we had excess liquidity as customers moved from other banks to our bank. We had some basic challenges regarding asset quality. One of the decisions that our shareholders took as a result of discussions was to really take a hard and honest look at the asset quality of our bank. As a result of that, we effectively took a provision against those assets to a conservative level that we were comfortable with. Thus, the shareholders brought capital into the bank to support operations against the losses created due to the slowdown. This is really the overriding point of success in how you move forward in a crisis.</p><h4>What is the significance of the acquisition of the commercial banking subsidiary of Troika Dialog in the framework of the bank's expansion strategy?</h4><p>We're consistently looking for expansion opportunities and acquisitions. The acquisition of Bank Troika Dialog was significant for our regional plans. A view held by many bankers and investors is that the size of Kazakhstan's population is limiting. It's a very significant country in terms of land mass and its natural resources, but the population only stands at 16 million people. This limits the development of a bank to some extent. The idea of the Bank Troika Dialog acquisition was to expand our regional footprint, and was a logical step considering our group already had 10,000 employees in Russia. In addition, the price was right and startup costs were low. The idea is to break even or push a small profit under a plan to focus our growth targets in Kazakhstan before being fully prepared to expand into other countries.</p><div class="quote">“We're consistently looking for expansion opportunities and acquisitions."</div><h4>How has the acquisition of ProstoKredit from Société Générale contributed to your bank's transformation into a modern, full-service financial institution?</h4><p>From an earnings standpoint, it contributes around 20% to 30% to our overall earnings going forward. It's a very significant contributor to our business. More importantly, if you look at the strategy of our bank, we'll eventually be forced to reduce our reliance on corporate lending. We must build and develop our retail segment with the overall aim to create a comfortable balance. The benefit of the ProstoKredit deal was an automatic expansion in our platform of almost 500 locations throughout the country, as well as a few hundred thousand clients.</p><h4>Eurasian Bank is the seventh biggest in Kazakhstan. What is your competitive edge?</h4><p>Most banks are in a period of restructuring, and that makes exact rankings difficult to formulate. We are in seventh position in real terms, and two of the top six banks are foreign, and therefore relatively well-run businesses. Those banks have limited appetite as international companies more often than not tailor their services to international clients and investors. Two banks are undergoing vast restructuring, leaving two fully operating domestic banks. My analysis of the competition amongst the top seven is that it isn't so severe, and Halyk Bank, being the largest of the banks, is certainly a significant competitor. Our competitive advantage is our liquidity. We operate under professional processes, and the system we have in place is watertight. Our reworked risk-management system and the acquisition of ProstoKredit will contribute to a strengthened overall operation, and we are now working on bringing all the elements together and raising brand awareness through advertising. We will then work on delivering our promises to our customers.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the bank in the framework of the cautious optimism that defines post-crisis Kazakhstan?</h4><p>We want to grow, and thanks to the tough decisions we took in the past we can grow. The focus is making sure we can be the absolute best in international practice. We grew well in 2010, and we expect to continue growing in 2011 and 2012. I want the bank to be large enough that it can support its clients and build its business in a sustainable way with a good return on equity for its shareholders.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Halyk Bank has one of the largest banking networks in Kazakhstan, and has significant regional operations. What are the bank's targets in terms of expansion in the medium term?</h4><p>The main concentration of Halyk Bank is the domestic market. Halyk is a leading bank in Kazakhstan—number two in terms of assets, but number one in terms of different products. In capitalization ratios, retail current accounts, and deposits we are also number one. We provide payments for state pensions, salaries, and stipends, as well as offering services to remote rural areas. Thus, we enjoy a significant social role. The bank is very profitable and we are commercially driven. The main target is the profitability of the bank, not the size. When we start to think about developing our business abroad, profit will be our number one concern. We currently have subsidiaries in Kyrgyzstan, Russia, and Georgia, and those markets are important for us. I stress Russia as a strategic market for Halyk. In view of the creation of the Customs Union, we think that our banking operations can be expanded by offering banking services for companies that have cross-border activities.</p><h4>What steps were taken over the last two years to restructure the bank's activities?</h4><p>The privatization of the bank ended in 2001, yet in 2009—under the anti-crisis program—the state intervened in the four biggest banks in Kazakhstan, and Halyk was one of those. That was probably the major change in the ownership structure of the bank. Samruk-Kazyna owned 20% of common shares; however, the bank—together with the main shareholder Almex—exercised stock options and the shares were bought back, which again brought a change in the shareholding structure. In terms of organizational structural, we had to increase the number of specialists in our non-performing loan (NPL) department, close certain non-profitable cash offices, and at the same time open offices in new locations. We had to cut costs and expenses, and we closed our representative office in London and a subsidiary in Mongolia. We re-focused our attention on Kazakhstan, creating new procedures and processes for the collection of bad loans as NPL rates began to grow. We had to put more efforts into improving our service quality, and we have achieved our targets. By the end of 2010 we became the best bank in Kazakhstan in terms of retail services. In 2010 we received five awards of excellence from various global financial institutes and agencies.</p><h4>How do you assess the importance of mobile and internet banking for Halyk Bank?</h4><p>Quality of service is very important for us. We have 629 branches in the country, and procedures can often be quite bureaucratic. In this regard, 2011 is the year of optimization for our bank. In our strategy we have put more effort into providing different channels of service, including mobile and internet banking. In terms of mobile banking we are number one, and this product was launched five years ago. We introduced internet banking for our retail customers in 2010 and we are making up ground. This sales channel is one of the most developing and promising. As internet penetration grows in the country, our client base will also develop. We view the development of distant channels as a strategic target for  the bank.</p><div class="quote">“By the end of 2010 we became the best bank in Kazakhstan in terms of retail services."</div><h4>What strategies have you developed to assist SMEs?</h4><p>We offer corporate, retail, and SME banking. Corporate customers account for around 65% of our loan portfolio, and retail customers make up the second largest group, approximately 20%, and SMEs 15%. Unfortunately, during the crisis the SME segment was the worst affected and we have the highest rate of NPLs in that part of the loan portfolio. Today we are working out our clients' problems, trying to restructure problem loans, and if we do not see the potential for recovery we go for foreclosure through the sale of collateral. At the same time, we see the future growth potential of that part of our business, especially in terms of fees and commissions. In this regard, we have established service centers for SMEs around the country where we offer services and products designed especially for them.</p><h4>How did the bank perform financially over 2010, and how does this compare the crisis period?</h4><p>Halyk Bank has always been profitable. We have a rate of 30% non-interest revenue—one of the highest among Kazakhstani banks, which provides a healthy income structure. Of course, 2009 was difficult due to increased costs rather than decreased revenues. NPLs and the worsening financial quality of borrowers meant we had to build up a lot of provisions. This meant that the cost of risk for 2009 was around 6%, which was almost equal to our net interest margins. The bank showed a marginal profit of around $15 million. However, our non-banking operations contributed the major part of our total consolidated profits, and on a group level Halyk earned a net profit of around KZT16 billion. This proved how well diversified our group is. In 2010 we were charging less on provisions as assets and loans began to improve, and the bank achieved KZT36.2 billion in  net profits.</p><h4>What is your evaluation of the steps taken by the government to improve the strength of the banking sector during the crisis period?</h4><p>Without the government's support we wouldn't have been able to pass through the crisis period so smoothly. Unfortunately, we saw some institutions default due to their more aggressive borrowing and lending strategies. The government supported the overall banking sector and real sector of the economy—around 15% of GDP was invested from the National Reserve Fund into the economy. The Kazakhstani anti-crisis program differs from the measures taken in Europe in that our government did not cut social support and created a road map program to control unemployment and create new jobs, while in the EU the main measures were to slash budget deficits through cutting social programs, which created unrest among the population in certain countries.</p><h4>What activities does the bank have in the bonds market?</h4><p>We are an issuer and a buyer. We have domestic bonds issued on the local market and Eurobonds. Halyk issued Eurobonds in January 2011, which was the debut bond after the crisis. As a buyer, we are very active in dealing and brokerage operations with other issuers' bonds, including state and corporate.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2011?</h4><p>We are more optimistic than in 2010. We are seeing an improvement in the economy, and positive developments in terms of loans and assets. We have noted a growth in demand for loans from our corporate and retail customers. However, SMEs will not start to recover so soon. We target a net profit of the group of around KZT40 billion to KZT45 billion.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Over the past three years the Kazakhstani banking sector underwent significant restructuring. In light of the government's policies, how would you assess the evolution of the sector's resilience and public confidence in the banking system?</h4><p> First of all, we should underline that the processes of restructuring did not concern the system as a whole but only three banks, with only one of them being systemically important, and remaining so.</p><p>The influence of the world crisis on Kazakhstan's banking sector resulted in an overreliance on external borrowings and liquidity shortages, a weak deposit base for maintaining lending activities, a concentration of risks in loan portfolios, and inadequate market discipline. In order to minimize systemic risks and stabilize the banking sector, the National Bank, the government, and the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan on the Regulation and Supervision of Financial Markets and Financial Organizations (the Agency) adopted the Joint Action Plan for the Stabilization of the Economy and Financial Sector for the Years 2009-2010, which provided for the allocation of $10 billion from the National Oil Fund to finance the most important sectors of the economy, mostly via bank financing.</p><p>During the crisis, the most significant pressure was brought to bear on some large banks such as BTA Bank, Alliance Bank, and Temir Bank, all of which were exposed to risks arising from external borrowings, foreign assets, and intra-group transactions. In order to offset the systemic risks associated with these banks, a procedure to restructure their external obligations was initiated. Overall, the process of restructuring was recognized by the world community and took approximately one-and-a-half years. Its completion has become one the most important signs of the normalization of the situation in Kazakhstan for financial market participants.</p><div class="quote">“We believe in the concept of a concentration of the financial markets."</div><p>In fact, not only the financial condition of the banks under restructuring has improved, but the level of systemic risks throughout the entire financial sector has also decreased. The share of external liabilities in the total liabilities of the banking sector fell significantly from 53.3% as of January 1, 2008, to just 21.1% by April 1, 2011.</p><p>The most important result of measures undertaken by the National Bank, the government, and the Agency has been the retaining of public confidence in Kazakhstan's financial system and the prevention of a run on the banks. Deposits have been growing steadily for the last three years to reach KZT7,239 billion as of April 1, 2011.</p><p>Thus, efforts made during the crisis period have helped resolve the most serious problems, improving the condition of the financial industry and restoring public confidence in it.</p><h4>What is the National Bank's policy stance going to be as the regulator? What is the new role envisaged for the Regional Financial Center of Almaty (RFCA) authority?</h4><p>At the beginning of the crisis, the National Bank was not responsible for the supervision and regulation of the financial system because in that period the regulator function was fully exercised by a specialized body, namely the Agency. Therefore, the functions of the National Bank were limited to conducting monetary policy, maintaining the domestic currency exchange rate, and exercising exchange rate controls. From the start of the crisis, all the efforts of the National Bank in the field of stabilizing the financial system were aimed at maintaining national currency stability and supporting the financial system with liquidity.</p><p>As for the new goals of regulation, some new focuses were singled out by the results of the crisis. The Conception of the Post-Crisis Development of Kazakhstan's Financial System includes all the new directions of work in this area. We should especially underline the establishment of more restrictions and controls on intra-group transactions, ensure additional requirements for the transparency of a bank's large clients, and place additional requirements on bank conglomerates' structure and management.</p><p>As for the functioning of the RFCA, nothing will change, excluding administrative arrangements—the function of developing the RFCA was transferred to the National Bank. To implement this function, we are creating a specialized new body under the National Bank.</p><p>Irrespective of the fact that the functions of the Agency and those of the RFCA have been transferred to the National Bank and a single financial regulator has been created, the conception of the development of the RFCA remains topical, and work on its implementation will continue.</p><p>The participants in the financial market will retain the benefits that had been introduced for the stock market. In addition, the infrastructure of the financial center will keep functioning. Work is presently being undertaken to implement a program to stage a public share placement in national companies for all the people of the Republic, i.e. stage a “People's IPO". The implementation of this program will give extra impetus to the development of the RFCA project and will make it feasible to attract as many citizens as possible to the intended issue of securities in companies under the National Welfare Fund, or Samruk-Kazyna.</p><p>To date, a pressing issue remains the further development of Almaty as a financial center for Islamic financing. All these measures will enjoy successful and accelerated implementation under the auspices of a single regulator, this being the National Bank.</p><h4>The increase of commodities prices brings the risk of the tenge appreciating, which might hinder the competitiveness of Kazakhstan's non-extractive sectors. What strategies are being pursued by the National Bank to stabilize the value of the tenge?</h4><p>In order to prevent the tenge from dramatically and significantly strengthening, the National Bank has been buying foreign exchange in the domestic market and has been sterilizing it through its instruments for the past few months. At the same time, the National Bank adheres to a policy aimed at both securing the stability of the national currency and preserving a favorable competitive environment for domestic manufacturers.</p><p>In this context, the fact that the foreign currency tunnel was given up in favor of a controlled float in February 2011 will (a) enable the tenge to strengthen, if necessary, at an equilibrium level and provide “comfort" to all sectors of the economy; (b) allow gold and FX assets to grow; and (c) secure long-term stability in the FX market.</p><h4>What are your expectations from the second wave of privatizations?</h4><p>I believe that in privatization, property comes out of state ownership and passes over to private ownership. Minority stakes will be offered in a “People's IPO". Control will remain with the government, and so I wouldn't call this a new wave of privatization. This is important and the National Bank supports it so as to privatize stakes in several companies, expand the equity holdings of pension funds, and allow individual investors to improve the overall equity culture in the country. We do not expect that there will be thousands of people involved in this step, but it is still important in developing the equity culture in Kazakhstan.</p><h4>How do you see the Kazakhstan Stock Exchange (KASE) evolving over the coming five years?</h4><p>We believe in the concept of a concentration of the financial markets. We have one stock exchange, and trading will definitely take place there. We have very good working relations with the KASE, which will play a central role in all of these developments. The central depository regulator will also play an important role. This is a joint effort of the government, Samruk-Kazyna, and the KASE, and we will be also involved either as the National Bank or through the payments system, which is our clear responsibility. We have around $1.2 trillion flowing annually through our payments system, which is one of the better figures—if not the best—in the entire Central Asia region.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Tell us about some of the core strategies that you have instituted at Delta Bank during your time as chairperson?<br></h4><p>I've been with Delta Bank for more than two years. It's historically been a small bank, yet whereas the bank assets were worth something like KZT25 billion, that has now doubled. The same goes for the bank's total capital, which has increased from KZT5.6 billion at the end of 2008 to KZT11.7 billion by mid-2011. Additionally, according to Standard &amp; Poor's, Delta Bank has better-than-sector-average asset quality indicators, a high share of liquid assets, and good capitalization ratios. I'm very proud to be a part of this bank and to have played a role in its rapid development. In fact, a lot of the developments took place during the crisis, with Delta Bank vastly increasing its assets and capital over that period specifically.</p><h4>What was the secret to Delta Bank's strong operating performance over that period in the country's economic history?</h4><p>Although we were a relatively small, unknown bank two years ago, among our main advantages was that we worked with some very sound corporate customers, most of who were from the SME segment. We decided to focus on our existing clients, to offer them new products, and to generally build on Delta Bank's core strengths, the foremost of which is our speed and flexibility in rendering the services our customers seek and need. This growth has also been reflected in the development of our human capital, with more people having been hired to support the bank's developing operations.</p><h4>How would you assess your current market position? How do you differentiate your services in areas where there is more competition?</h4><p>I think the market position of Delta Bank is strong enough in the small banks' segment. The most encouraging aspect is that such banks are strengthening every year. As for branch numbers, our bank has advantages compared to other banks that are of more or less the same size in terms of assets. In 2010 Delta Bank opened two new branches in Pavlodar and Petropavlovsk, and the branch network consisted of 11 branches, seven additional offices, and one representative office. In 2011 we are planning to open one more branch in Ust-Kamenogorsk, and additional offices throughout Kazakhstan for individual customers, mainly.</p><h4>What is your opinion of the general level of development in the banking and financial sectors in Kazakhstan overall?</h4><p>We were very proud of the financial and banking sector before the beginning of the crisis in 2007. The crisis was an experience for Kazakhstan, and the sector has learnt from it and it has helped the country to develop further. Overall, we have a good finance and banking sector, as we must if Kazakhstan is going to continue developing and integrating with the world economy.</p><div class="quote">“The crisis was an experience for Kazakhstan, and the sector has learnt from it and it has helped the country to develop further."</div><h4>What niche market and customer segments does Delta Bank seek to target?</h4><p>Most of our clients are from the agricultural sector. We chose to focus on the agricultural sector because it is government supported, which means a lot of resources are flowing toward it. We are a part of governmental programs in this sector. We work directly with farmers and also with the subsidiaries of KazAgro. Currently, our bank is tailored to support this industry, and its small, efficient size reflects that. Nevertheless, we are planning on growing and diversifying, and of course as our operations develop we will become comparable in size to banks supporting the oil and gas, and metallurgical industries. We are also extending into more areas, and plan to be in 12 regions across Kazakhstan by the end of 2011.</p><h4>With the government's 2010-2014 plan for the diversification of the economy, what are your bank's prospects for more cooperation with foreign investors in the coming years?</h4><p>Most of our customers are working with foreign partners to export their produce abroad. We are also playing a part in this, helping with communications, cooperation, and transactions with foreign partners. As diversification brings in even more foreigners, we are open to more cooperation with foreign investors and partners in the future as well.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the development of the mortgage sector in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>We are in partnership with the Kazakhstan Mortgage Company, which is a governmental program. Many banks suffered from retail lending during the crisis, and so the government made an effort to support them. On this base and framework, we will only see the mortgage sector go from strength to strength.</p><h4>What's your outlook for 2011 and beyond in Kazakhstan from a banking perspective?</h4><p>All the indicators point to continued growth. Considering that the economy proved its viability in 2010—with GDP growth at 7%, and a stable national currency—I think Kazakhstani banks will face the issue of expanding lending to the real sector in 2011. It's time to move on, keeping in mind the lessons of crisis.</p><h4></h4>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Many banks have their headquarters in Almaty. Why did Tsesnabank (TSB) choose the capital Astana as its home base?<br></h4><p>It is good to be closer to the decision makers and major national companies. We work with Kazakhstan Temir Zholy, the state railway company, various oil companies, Samruk-Kazyna, KazAgro, and so forth. The list is huge. We try to work with all major players, as any bank of our size would do. We feel that our advantage is in our being located here in Astana. It gives us the advantage of being close to the decision makers and the main bodies of the financial sector. This could create discomfort for some, but we feel comfortable here. This isn't to say we only work with the government. If you look at our loan portfolio, government entities constitute only a small percentage.</p><h4>TSB has a historically strong presence in northern and central Kazakhstan. What strategies have you developed to replicate its regional success countrywide?</h4><p>We serve the entire country. After 19 years of existence, we call ourselves a universal bank. We have branches in all regions. We also have around 90 service points that operate under these branches. We are present in all cities and regions of Kazakhstan. We serve all sectors of the economy and are highly client focused. Due to the fact that we started up in this region, we are stronger in the north and center than in the south of Kazakhstan. Our short-term strategy is to increase our penetration in Almaty and southern Kazakhstan. We do retail, SME, and corporate banking. Our retail branch is strong, and constitutes around 30% of our loan portfolio. It did, however, shrink due to the crisis, and we concentrated more on our corporate banking efforts. But overall we still have plans to grow in retail, and that is why we are opening offices across the country.</p><div class="quote">“After 19 years of existence, we call ourselves a universal bank."</div><h4>TSB opened a representative office in Russia. What are your targets for TSB's operations abroad?</h4><p>We opened that office to help our clients better penetrate the Russian market. We have a lot of clients working in Russia, and are going to open another representative office in Beijing, China. The conditions there are more challenging, but we believe that it will be a successful venture. Our operations abroad follow the operations of Kazakhstani businesses abroad.</p><h4>What role will SMEs play in light of the government's plans to promote the non-prime sectors of the economy?</h4><p>Services definitely have a big role to play in diversification. SMEs are going into services and growing well. There are lots of services that you can get in the West that still don't exist here. There will be a lot of progress in this area. Also, big national companies are outsourcing more and more, and that is good for the country because that role is going to be taken by SMEs. SMEs that support the oil and gas and mining industries also have a bright future. We do, however, have to make sure that SMEs are well defined in this picture, and have all the necessary support from the government.</p><h4>What measures can be taken to increase the resilience of SMEs?</h4><p>We need to introduce more flexibility for smaller companies. Laws need to be changed in that direction. We need laws that will protect individual entrepreneurs so that they are less harassed by government entities like tax agencies. We also need cheaper resources. Compared to other countries, I wouldn't say that we have the highest interest rates, and the government has definitely made the right decision to offer low-interest SME funding.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[stocking-up]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You became president of the Kazakhstan Stock Exchange (KASE) in April 2009. What has changed during your time at the helm?<br></h4><p>One of the most significant developments was the merging of the two trading floors following new listing requirements. I should also mention changes in the amount of illiquid shares. We have also taken important steps in expanding the number of financial instruments available to KASE members, and simplified membership procedures. In addition, we worked in cooperation with the regulators over the crisis period to develop the “buffer category". Some of our companies issued bonds, and it became problematic for them to fulfill their debt obligations. If these companies now meet certain criteria, we can offer to transfer them to the buffer category, rather than de-listing them, in order to rehabilitate them. We are also proud to have improved our corporate governance and reduced our risks.</p><h4>How have these steps improved the performance of the KASE?</h4><p>Some of the measures were reactions to the global financial crisis. These worked toward improving the general regulation of the stock market. We reduced the number of non-settlements and the non-fulfillment of obligations. Some of the companies that were transferred to the “buffer category" rank very highly today. For them it was a very good rehabilitation procedure.</p><h4>KASE was founded in 1993 as the Kazakh Interbank Currency Exchange. How has the institution become more sophisticated since then?</h4><p>During the initial stages, the KASE was known as the Interbank Currency Exchange. Now we are a universal stock exchange. Different kinds of instruments are traded today, not only currency, but bonds, shares, derivatives, and other instruments. We have also transformed into a more open joint-stock company. We currently see the most activity in the currency market and state treasuries.</p><div class="quote">“We believe that Almaty has enough potential to be one of the regional financial centers in the CIS."</div><h4>Which relatively less-traded instruments have the best future prospects?</h4><p>We naturally hope that the stock market will have a strong future. All our efforts are concentrated toward accelerating and increasing the amount of liquidity in the stock market. In 2010, in cooperation with the Vienna Stock Exchange, we conducted a project aimed at improving the liquidity on the KASE equity market and building capacity. The project was funded by the EBRD, and we now have very good recommendations from our colleagues in Vienna. We included these recommendations in our three-year plan. We are engaged in consultations with market representatives and government officials. We are also seeing an increase in IPOs and SPOs. We are in the process of intensive discussions about the technicalities of these upcoming processes. These are complicated processes and we have to meet different requirements. We also hope and expect to see more retail investors in our market, and believe that this will increase liquidity.</p><h4>What is the level of cooperation between the KASE and its international counterparts?</h4><p>The KASE is a member of a number of associations and exchanges, and we meet our colleagues from other exchanges on various occasions. We always have the possibility to contact different exchanges, consulting companies, and international financial organizations directly. We established an international department and forged relationships with foreign financial actors. We have affiliate status at the World Federation of Exchanges, and within three years we would like to become a full member of this organization.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the KASE's role in helping make Kazakhstan a regional financial hub in the CIS?</h4><p>We believe that Almaty has enough potential to be one of the regional financial centers in the CIS. All of our operations are geared toward developing Almaty in this role. We have a very developed banking system, and it is a good basis to develop the KASE and other segments of the financial sector. Our regulations are based on international standards, and are more or less the same as in any developed nation. In this respect, Almaty is already prepared.</p><h4>What trends are you expecting in credit availability as the economy recovers from the crisis?</h4><p>The worst times are behind us. Step by step the situation is improving. From a statistical point of view, we don't see rapid growth in credit portfolios because of the lingering effects of the crisis. Over the last 2-3 years, a proportion of credits have been repaid, and new credits are lagging behind. The processes are starting to improve and new credits will soon catch up in 2011.</p><h4>Where do you see the KASE in two to three years time?</h4><p>If we reach our target of becoming a full member of the World Federation of Exchanges, it will mean that the KASE will become a stock exchange based on international standards with transparent rules, with more reliable systems and schemes of payments. It will also provide more clarity to foreign investors. In this way, our market will become more developed in terms of available instruments, liquidity, reliability, and transparency. The Kazakhstani financial system is dominated by the banking sector. Developed financial systems are based on a developed stock market. It is our primary goal to develop our stock exchange as part of a modern financial system.</p><h4>In which non-prime sectors of the economy do you see potential for foreign investors?</h4><p>Agriculture and the food industry show potential, especially in terms of what is happening around the world. We have an enormous amount of territory with great potential to develop agriculture and a food-processing industry. There are also opportunities in the chemical industry, connected to the oil and gas sector. Investors will also be attracted by the opportunities in metallurgy and machinery assemblage. We also have to mention the Customs Union. For enterprises in territories close to the Russian border this means a great potential for trade. The development of cooperation within the Customs Union will help intensify investment relations among Kazakhstan, the Russian Federation, and Belarus. Aside from this, considering significant volumes of cross-border trade between Russia and China, Kazakhstan may attract more investments from these countries.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Outside In]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[outside-in]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role is Visor Capital playing in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>Visor Capital started about five years ago, and it is owned by a local company, Visor Holding. Our shareholders' vision was to have an international-style investment bank here in Kazakhstan. At that time, the owners saw domestic banks making a lot of money in the commercial lending market. These banks had very little incentive to wean their clients out of a lending relationship and into a capital market solution. Global firms were conducting the large transactions, and so our shareholders saw a place for a local operator that had the right international skill sets and capabilities. We're not the only broker or advisory firm, but we're the only one that has really brought in key international legal, research, and capital markets experts. We also have a subsidiary in the UK that is FSA authorized and a member of the London Stock Exchange. This naturally helps our business here and enhances our image. However, the main reason is that an awful lot of Kazakhstani assets happen to be listed outside of the country. A couple of examples of such companies are Kazakhmys and ENRC, which are both FTSE 100 firms. To summarize, in only five years Visor Capital has become the only Kazakhstani investment bank with such an international footprint and recognition. We have the capability to attract foreign investors' funding (bonds, shares) for companies with assets in Kazakhstan, and we help Kazakhstani companies to get visibility among international investors.</p><h4>Does Visor focus on local or international clients, and what sets the company apart from its regional competitors?</h4><p>In brokerage, we focus on international investors, in part because the local pension funds have direct market access to the local market, without the need of a broker. As of today, Visor Capital trades with most of the international emerging market funds investing in Central Asia. We are very different from other firms in the CIS and emerging markets, where you often see asset management companies control the broker/investment bank. Our parent company  owns a separate subsidiary, Compass Asset Management, which manages third-party money and with which we only have an arm's length relationship. One example of Compass Asset Management's activities was the creation of Tau Capital, originally set up in joint venture with the Rothschild family. These types of funds demand transparency and arm's length dealing. In many emerging markets, this kind of arm's length relationship doesn't happen, even within a brokerage/investment bank. So one thing we've done is to bring in international market practices and train a lot of people here locally. We have become a company that international parties trust to do deals with in this country. For example, we advised Kookmin Bank of Korea in their acquisition of Bank Center Credit. With Bank Center Credit, the initial sellers request was one transaction to take out all the shareholders, but we were able to negotiate a deal whereby Kookmin could reach a majority over a multi-stage process. The first tranche was at 3.2 times book value, but the cumulative price paid to date is closer to 1.6 times book value, which is a reasonable price for a strategic investor buying into a bank.</p><h4>What other sectors besides finance do you believe appeal to foreign investors in Kazakhstan, and what is needed to increase interest?</h4><p>The big opportunities are obviously in the resource and resource-related sectors. What Kazakhstan still needs in order to make it a place worthwhile for investors in non-resource sectors on a bigger scale is to have an integrated Central Asian market, and this appears to be a long ways off.</p><div class="quote">“We have become a company that international parties trust to do deals with in this country."</div><h4>What about the prospects for the Eurasian market considering the recently enacted Customs Union?</h4><p>That is definitely helping to start the process, but some see Russia as the larger beneficiary because of its larger market and industrial base.  The real opportunity for Kazakhstan should be for a more unified market throughout Central Asia and its Caspian neighbors, but this integration that would seem to be natural does have some political issues to overcome. Young nations do not always have the confidence to be cooperative neighbors.</p><h4>How do you see regional dynamics in terms of your company's development strategy?</h4><p>In our business, you want to go to a place where it is possible to do deals and trade securities. Right now we're looking at expanding into Mongolia. It shares a lot of characteristics with Kazakhstan, mainly its dependency on resources, with a large, sparsely populated nation with an infrastructure deficit, and it also has a common Soviet-controlled past. It has a huge underdeveloped resource potential, with China as the main market.  Even so, it's a smaller country than Kazakhstan in terms of opportunities—Kazakhstan has 20 times the GDP today and will remain our core focus. We also want to work with Russian investors, clients, and companies, as they have a natural interest in this region and it is within their comfort zone.</p><h4>What is your competitive advantage?</h4><p>We have a solid team and unique business knowledge. It comes from experience and also a physical presence here, enabling us to engage in lobbying activities with regulators and government as we try to shape the agenda for the investors' benefit, and the country's benefit. Even just little things, like helping potential investors meet the people they need to meet when in Kazakhstan, and have access to the necessary and pertinent facts. Those things are difficult to do unless you are here in the country. International investors can feel safe to benefit from our local knowledge while working in an environment they are used to (FSA-regulated subsidiary, respect of Chinese walls and more generally of international best practices). Kazakhstani companies can easily benefit from our international client base. Beyond this, we can help them to improve their processes to satisfy international requirements with the investors they will be dealing with.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the Kazakhstani economy in 2011?</h4><p>GDP growth will stay steady, probably at a slower rate than 2010, although it depends on commodity prices. Commodity prices at current levels for a sustained period will lead to a large increase in US dollar inflows and government revenues. In 2010 we saw high GDP growth, and the government will want to slow that a little to avoid inflationary pressure. Inflation is nevertheless picking up, and the CPI is expected to be between 8.5 and 9% in 2011. It's under control, but it's still something to be wary of. For companies that have costs denominated in tenge, such as in the mining industry, inflation could be very costly if combined with an appreciating currency.  They were the biggest beneficiaries of the 2009 devaluation of the tenge. We should also keep in mind that, as in many emerging countries, food accounts for about 45% of the CPI basket. That is why the government is very sensitive on inflation, because it would directly affect the population much more than in countries such as Italy or France, where food only constitutes about 15% of the CPI basket.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Total has been active in Kazakhstan since 1993. How would you describe the company's contribution to the realization of the country's full energy potential?<br></h4><p>We have mainly been involved in the Kashagan project through the North Caspian Sea Production Sharing Agreement (NCSPSA), which includes not only the Kashagan field, but also other fields around it as well in the offshore Caspian. We are one of the main shareholders in this project alongside KazMunayGaz, and other companies. We aim also at conducting exploration activities in Kazakhstan, but we have not been able to achieve our objectives so far. Total has a very large amount of experience in the offshore oil and gas industry. We are bringing this expertise into the Kashagan project as a member of the NCSPSA. We are particularly involved in the North Caspian Operating Company (NCOC), the operating company piloting the development of the Kashagan field. It is a complex organization because it is a very multifaceted project. There are many companies involved in the construction of the project, but there is a company in charge of the general operatorship of the project, and Total is highly involved in this company [NCOC]. As an investor, we try to bring in our experience in offshore developments every time we have the opportunity. This is especially essential in Kazakhstan, where a lot of projects are developed in extreme conditions. Total also has experience in exploration sciences, an expertise we are planning to bring to the country more and more. There is still potential for exploration in Kazakhstan, both offshore and onshore. Kazakhstan also has a fairly well-educated workforce, and we have not encountered too many difficulties in finding top candidates to hire. It is also our policy to educate the local workforce promoted by the Kazakhstani national education system. This is favorable for us as we can then rely on the local workforce for our operations.</p><h4>How do you see the future of Kazakhstan as an energy provider to Western and Eastern markets?</h4><p>Kazakhstan has huge resources, consisting mainly of oil, but with considerable levels of gas, too. Of course, Kazakhstan is a landlocked country, but it is well connected with a pipeline network system to Russia and China, and in the future to Europe. It already exports to Europe via rail, and it is well positioned to supply energy markets, particularly China. If significant gas discoveries are made, China will become an even bigger market for Kazakhstan.</p><h4>In which energy sector areas do you see opportunities for foreign investors?</h4><p>The oil and gas industry itself provides a lot of opportunities, but I think in my view a particular area that should be developed is new energy sources. Companies such as Total are diversifying to the point where they can be considered energy companies, rather than simply oil and gas companies. In this country there is the potential for solar, wind, and biomass energy production. There is a lot to do in terms of clean energies to diversify away from the oil and gas, or clean coal technologies.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Chartis is the new brand name of a well-established insurance company. What level of operations does it have in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>On September 27, 2010 Chartis Insurance Company, the new brand adopted by AIG's non-life insurance business around the world, was launched in Kazakhstan. Taking the Greek word for map, chartis, the company's name suggests our ability to set a course for clients and to help them explore new possibilities. Our new brand line is “Your world, insured". The phrase “your world" helps to personalize our brand and communicate our commitment to clients and partners. It declares that we meet their insurance needs—large or small, individual or commercial. The term “insured" alludes to the security and assurance that our products and services provide to customers. Today, Chartis serves 40 million clients in over 160 countries and jurisdictions. By adopting a new brand for AIG general insurance companies, we are changing our identity, but preserving the enduring strengths and qualities for which clients have recognized in us over the past 90 years. These qualities are our commitment to client service, innovative thinking and solutions, and our network of global experts. We are extremely proud of our new brand, as well as the unity and values that it represents.</p><p>Chartis Kazakhstan provides insurance services to multinational customers from underwriting to loss control to claims payment. We have made considerable efforts to develop the market, and our insurance services meet the highest international standards including the quality and reliability of reinsurance protection. Our partners in reinsurance undergo the thorough analysis of Chartis head office to ensure the best interests of the insured and the reputation of the market as a whole. Typically, we work with professional reinsurance companies with ratings no lower than A- according to S&amp;P.</p><p>In Kazakhstan, we have been known mainly as a leading corporate insurer. Our goal has been to penetrate new sectors, building on our successful corporate insurance practice. To this extent we're increasing our exposure to the medium-sized sector and trying to develop a consumer lines business. Our company has traditionally not served the retail sector. The way we have chosen to get into retail is through electronic sales. Right now we're developing two projects where we'll be able to sell our travel, accident, and health insurance products through our partners' websites. This allows us to minimize local administration and capitalize on the expertise and best practices of Chartis' global network.</p><div class="quote">“Our goal has been to penetrate new sectors, building on our successful corporate insurance practice."</div><h4>How have strategies changed in the post-crisis environment?</h4><p>In two ways. First, we have revisited our governance model and re-calibrated it to meet the most exacting global corporate requirements. From a business perspective we are keener to “localize" or “countrify" our offerings. Clearly, some of the products that were successful within the Chartis group in one country are sometimes not appropriate in a new market. As a result, we are trying to promote the lines that are truly applicable to the Kazakhstani market. As a truly international company, we are setting the standards for other insurance companies in terms of technical underwriting ability, innovations in the insurance field, and the knowledge we hold. We have a level of expertise and strength that will never leave the company.</p><h4>What makes Kazakhstan different from other countries that Chartis is present in?</h4><p>Obviously I cannot comment about the entire world. As a branch of an international company that feels and acts locally, our underwriting techniques and guidelines will be different in different countries. And this has always been Chartis' advantage—underwriting techniques and the ability to introduce new products and cover niche areas at a country level.</p><p>In Kazakhstan, we observe a more “mature" competition, in the sense that other firms are skilled enough to develop diverse products. The market is very well integrated. That makes Kazakhstan different from any other Central Asian country. It is the most diversified and sophisticated financial market in the region, because of the ability of several companies to compete on an even basis.</p><h4>In the face of competition in classic insurance areas, what niches are you targeting to expand your reach?</h4><p>The number of products-from very conventional to the most sophisticated-we can offer to the market is really big; what really distinguishes us from the competition on core products is our ability to provide value-added including the largest capacity in the market, in-depth expertise, risk engineering capabilities, quality of service, and fast, fair claims settlements.</p><h4>How has your competitive advantage changed vis-í -vis local companies?</h4><p>This is a fast evolving and maturing market, with increasing competition and rapidly changing dynamics. What we offer to our customers is unparalleled consistency, long-term stability, quality of service and the strength, experience, and sophistication of one of the most internationally acclaimed insurance providers. We are committed to the Kazakhstani market, which offers the most promising opportunities amongst all Central Asian republics. We are here to stay and service our local and international clients exceptionally. This is, in short, Chartis' unique value proposition for the Kazakhstani market.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of Al Hilal, and why do they call you the “orange bank"?<br></h4><p>Al Hilal Bank in Kazakhstan is a subsidiary of Al Hilal Bank in Abu Dhabi, which in turn is 100% owned by the government of Abu Dhabi. The bank was established in Kazakhstan based on an intergovernmental agreement signed between the Republic of Kazakhstan and the government of the UAE. The parent bank was established in Abu Dhabi in 2008, and the Kazakhstan subsidiary was launched in 2010. It is the first Islamic bank in the country. One of the main principles behind the creation of Al Hilal Bank was to demonstrate that an Islamic bank can be dynamic and progressive, while at the same time remaining strictly compliant with sharia principles. It is important to present this model well in Kazakhstan, a market that is 60% Muslim, yet unfamiliar with Islamic banking. Al Hilal Bank chose orange for its branding as it represents liveliness and dynamism, and therefore encapsulates our business ethic of principled professionalism and putting the individual at the heart of everything we do.</p><h4></h4><h4>What sparked Al Hilal's business interest in the country, and led to the establishment of the bank in Kazakhstan in 2010?</h4><p>Traditionally, there have been strong brotherly relations between the UAE and Kazakhstan. Secondly,in 2009 Kazakhstan introduced comprehensive legislation in parliament to facilitate Islamic banking opportunities. The bank was looking for foreign expansion prospects, and when this announcement was made, we decided to seize the opportunity and move in. The lack of any Islamic banking competitor also made the proposition even more attractive. It was a challenge worth taking on, and we have not regretted our decision.</p><h4>As a new concept in Kazakhstan, what strategies are you developing to increase awareness and demand for your Islamic banking products and services?</h4><p>We have three main goals in Kazakhstan. The first target is to become a successful Islamic bank from a commercial point of view. Secondly, our aim is to raise the profile of Islamic banking in the country. Finally, because we represent the government of Abu Dhabi, we are seeking opportunities for UAE investors to participate and facilitate in the economic growth of Kazakhstan. This will help the UAE to diversify its oil and gas revenues. This also benefits Kazakhstan because it is looking for more investment. We facilitate enhanced cooperation between the two countries.</p><div class="quote">“One of the main principles behind the creation of Al Hilal Bank was to demonstrate that an Islamic bank can be dynamic and progressive."</div><h4>Do you believe the regulatory framework for Islamic banking is complete and satisfactory?</h4><p>The documentation processes and finalization of contracts took longer than expected, yet Kazakhstan has approved comprehensive legislation to facilitate Islamic banking. I would say 80%-90% of the process has been addressed, with certain tax aspects requiring further fine-tuning as part of the current legislation. The remaining issues will be ironed out soon, and the process will be complete. There is active involvement and support from key ministries and regulatory bodies to facilitate the process. We are very happy with the framework, and are thrilled Kazakhstan has taken these steps to allow the country to develop an Islamic banking sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Sogecap Liban's position within Lebanon's life insurance market?</h4><p>Sogecap Liban is the eighth life insurance company in Lebanon in terms of premium income, based on 2010 figures. Our company has been gaining market share over the past few years and now represents 6% of Lebanon's life insurance market. In 2011, we expect our turnover to increase by 8% as compared to 2010. Sogecap Liban will indeed be registering significant premium growth, whereas figures published by the Association of Insurance Companies in Lebanon reveal that the life insurance market has registered a slowdown in the first half of 2011 as compared to the previous year.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the increased penetration of life insurance in Lebanon?</h4><p>We believe the protection component of the life insurance market is likely to enjoy greater market penetration in the coming years. It will be boosted by the expected growth in retail loans. On the other hand, the capitalization component is not directly correlated to any other market, and so its progression is less foreseeable.</p><h4>What is your outlook for overall premium growth?</h4><p>The life insurance market is not easily foreseeable. Figures published by the profession highlight significant growth in 2010, followed by a slight deceleration in the first half of 2011. At Sogecap Liban, we expect annual growth in a range of 10% to 12% over the coming years. In the sector, premium growth will depend, to a large extent, on the evolution of insurance regulations. Indeed, the protection component of the insurance market is closely related to the progression of bank loans. Although the latter have been on an upward trend in Lebanon over the past few years, and are likely to keep growing at a good pace, it is worth mentioning that the protection market represents around one-quarter of the life insurance market only. Aggregate premium growth will therefore mainly rely, in the medium run, on the growth of the capitalization market. For that to happen, regulatory changes will have to be introduced.</p><div class="quote">“We expect annual growth in a range of 10% to 12% over the coming years."</div><h4>What measures do you feel should be taken to raise awareness of life insurance products among Lebanese consumers?</h4><p>Most people spend first and save what is left at the end of the month. Few people save first and then spend the rest. On the other hand, the hazards and adversities of real life are so many that only life insurance policies (protection and savings) can minimize them. At Sogecap Liban, the main task of our sales force is to advise our customers properly. Each person has special desires and our job is to provide him/her with the right product. Indeed, at the market level, awareness raising needs to be worked on if the insurance industry is to develop substantially in Lebanon. Several initiatives could serve this purpose; in many countries, such mass-targeting initiatives originate in the industry. In Lebanon, no such actions have been organized to date, and companies run their individual campaigns mostly focusing on marketing their own products.</p><h4>How do you assess the legal framework for life insurance in Lebanon, and do you feel there are steps that should be taken to enhance the regulatory environment?</h4><p>The solvency of Lebanese insurance companies would certainly be reinforced if life and non-life insurance activities were separated on the one hand, and if minimum capital requirements were raised to a significant level on the other. On both those issues, the Lebanese market lags behind when compared to OECD countries, not to mention several emerging markets. Nevertheless, Sogecap Liban has anticipated this, and currently has shareholders' equity of around $16 million, thus enabling the company to easily raise its capital if need be by $10 million, a figure that is commonly brought up in the framework of industry discussions. Furthermore, solvency issues could be differentiated between life and non-life activities, as well as according to the type of capitalization products. For instance, signature risk is significantly different for unit-based products, the financial performance of which is managed by an asset manager and the capital of which is not guaranteed by the insurer. The development of the current regulation could strengthen the development of the capitalization market, including complementary retirement insurance. Indeed, we believe developing the relatively weak capitalization market in Lebanon requires regulatory adjustments in some areas. One is the compulsory investment of at least 50% of reserves in domestic assets. No differentiation is currently made for solvability margins required on unit-linked savings, even though the insurer does not guarantee the invested capital. The cost of equity to mobilize is too high and weighs significantly on the performance of these products. However, most importantly, and given that the life insurance market is strongly related to the volume of the capitalization component, fiscal incentives would be of the highest relevance if we were to seek the development of the capitalization industry. Indeed, should the regulatory authorities amend the present legal framework, introducing tax incentives for employers and even for employees, voluntary retirement plans would then benefit from a significant boost. Such an initiative has multiple advantages and leads to a win-win situation down the line. Tax incentives to employers would entice them to support their employees by offering them additional benefits related to their retirement income. Tax incentives to employees would further encourage them to contribute to complementary retirement plans, still weak in Lebanon despite the inefficiency of the national social security system.</p><h4>What are the comparative efficiencies and strengths of the Lebanese life insurance sector relative to other Arab countries?</h4><p>The retail life insurance industry in Lebanon, and especially through the banks, is in its early stages of development. It has, however, been growing strongly. In the MENA region, Lebanon has the highest penetration rate of insurance at 2.8% of GDP, the same as Morocco and Bahrain. The insurance density rating is the highest in the region after countries in the Gulf and it is progressing at a strong pace. It has increased by 12% between 2009 and 2010 according to Swiss Re, based on 2010 figures. When it comes to value, the Lebanese insurance market—all branches included—reached a value of $1.07 billion in 2010, of which 24.4% was in life insurance, a share that is significantly higher than the average 17.7% of the MENA region. The life market in Lebanon offers a range of products and services related to capitalization and protection, and it is comparable to European standards.</p><h4>What specific and unique products does Sogecap Liban offer?</h4><p>Sogecap Liban has innovated both in protection and capitalization products. With regards to protection, contracts have been made accessible and easy to subscribe to, and regarding capitalization, unit-based products allow the subscriber to take advantage of stock exchange performances. Although we have focused our business on mass production, we also offer some retirement products to corporate customers.</p><h4>What competitive advantages are created by Sogecap's affiliation with Société Générale de Banque au Liban (SGBL)?</h4><p>Sogecap Liban's production is exclusively marketed through SGBL's branches, SGBL being Sogecap Liban's main shareholder. Our success is attributable to the strong integration of our processes at the level of product definition and production management.</p><h4>What is your growth strategy for Sogecap Liban?</h4><p>Today, the strong growth of the SGBL network, especially following the acquisition of part of Lebanese-Canadian Bank's business, will certainly strengthen production as well as assets under management starting in 2012. In addition, the industry awaits fiscal incentives that would favor capitalization retirement plans, especially since retirement insurance is very weak in Lebanon. As a specialist in life and retirement insurance, Sogecap Liban is well positioned to satisfy the important demand that is likely to follow public initiatives.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>TBY talks to Mariano Pataní¨, General Director of Caspian Marine Services, on the business environment, HR, and growth strategies.</h4>
<h4></h4>
<h4>TBY In your experience, how has Kazakhstan changed recently as a business environment?</h4>
<p>MARIANO PATANíˆ I came here with Saipem, and in three years with that company I obtained a lot of experience. This country is full of people who are easy to work with, and who accept constructive criticism. The government is very open to suggestions from all sectors, and that is also positive for the business environment here. I have also observed an increase in the number of English speakers. This is not a country that is closed to foreigners, far from it; it’s open to tourists and investors. People who invest here can make money, and it is easy to set up any kind of business you like.</p>
<h4>How does the name of the company highlight its drive and operations?</h4>
<p>We do not necessarily emphasize the marine aspect of the company. In the same period when we bought this company we got all the staff from another company that had worked in oil and gas services for more than 10 years. We like the name as it highlights the fact that we are working onshore and offshore in the oil and gas sector, which is where the future lies. We also have a close relationship with Caspian Offshore Construction, which is the first privately owned fully Kazakhstani company known for fast and sustainable development in the market of marine fleet operators in the North Caspian Sea. We provide brokerage services, and our relationship just goes from strength to strength.</p>
<h4>What is the percentage of construction in your business volume compared to other services?</h4>
<p>Construction represents 50% to 60% of our business. We are involved in industrial installation, especially welding and carpentry and electro-instrumental industry. Our company is also involved in projects for the upgrading of vessels and in all oil and gas infrastructure. We work with all the major companies involved in the oil and gas sector, such as but not limited to ENI, Saipem, Ersai, Tozzi Sud, Rosetti Marino, and Bonatti.</p>
<h4>Considering that the bulk of your work is in construction, how do you make sure that your team has the right expertise?</h4>
<p>I bring in expatriates at the end of their careers to benefit from their experience. I am in touch with different universities in Kazakhstan to find good engineers. I prefer foreign specialists, because when you are at the end of your career you are not protective of your knowledge and are ready to transfer it to the new generation. Once the new generation absorbs the knowledge, foreign specialists can go back to their countries and enjoy their lives, and then the local personnel is skilled and has the knowledge of 45 years of experience to work on any project. We have employed foreign project managers, a site supervisor, a HSE manager, and highly skilled specialists of middle positions for a workforce nationalization program that in a few years will give us the possibility to work solely with Kazakhstani manpower. I have been applying this strategy for only three years, but I believe it is the right way to be a major competitor in the oil and gas sector. After all, this is a dangerous business and we need the right knowledge.</p>
<h4>How do you want to grow your business from this point on?</h4>
<p>Caspian Marine Services is working right now as a service company assisting foreign companies that wish to start business in Kazakhstan and helping companies that are already present in the country. If you want to grow a company you must invest and if you look at the quality of the service that you provide and not only at the profit that you can get, for sure you will succeed. We have a department at our company that provides cars with drivers to oil and gas companies. We are strong for two reasons: we always invest in new staff and we periodically train our team. We believe that this is an important service in support of the oil and gas sector. We want to develop this business and develop the construction business. Additionally, we are looking at the international market in order to explore the possibility of bringing investors and technology into Kazakhstan. We boast quality, the best HSE practices, a training center, and the right service companies. We are also boosted by our subsidiary STAMGazStroy, which allows us to obtain services at a good price. We are also looking into milk production, as agriculture is a sector with lots of possibilities.</p>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Azerboru JSC was founded in 1947 and has carried out an ambitious development program over the last few years. How has the company's profile evolved over the years?</h4><p>Our company was founded in 1947, establishing a pipe-rolling plant in Sumgait city, on the shores of the Caspian Sea. It was the first company in the ferrous metallurgy industry in Azerbaijan. On the eve of 1952, the first pipe mill was commissioned—“mill 140". In 1957 and 1959, the next two mills "250-1" and "250-2" were brought online. The first Azerbaijani seamless steel pipes were made in 1952, and, since then, the main products of the plant have been drill pipes, casing, tubing, as well as line and service pipes. Azerboru JSC achieved a strong reputation across the Soviet Union, exporting almost all its production to the other republics. However, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, we started to lose our historical markets, and by the end of the 1990s production almost halted at the plant. Our main strategy over the last decade, especially since 2005 when we started rehabilitating the plant, has been to get back on our feet, reestablish the whole production chain, and expand our business activity abroad.</p><h4>What strategies did you implement to restructure the company and return its export profile?</h4><p>In the last few years we have invested in widening our product portfolio in terms of pipe diameters, wall thicknesses, and so on. We have also focused on obtaining international standards to expand our exports. In this regard, we have upgraded one of the three mills the plant has, and at the moment the production capacity of this mill is 200,000 tons a year. We believe that the potential of the market will enable us to further increase our production and triple sales in the near future. In this regard, we are mainly an export-oriented company, and the investments we did during the crisis period will enable us to regain our position in foreign markets, starting from the CIS region.</p><div class="quote">“Our historical markets are Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and other oil-producing countries."</div><h4>What foreign markets is Azerboru JSC eying for the future?</h4><p>Our historical markets are Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and other oil-producing countries. Since 2005, we have started to export again to these markets, increasing the overall export figures year by year, for we currently export 97% of our products. In this regard, we are opening up European markets after obtaining the right international standards to operate in them, and we have already successfully supplied pipes to German, Austrian, and Italian companies, and are expecting to increase our volume of trade and exports in 2012. At the same time, we are currently working on obtaining American Petroleum Institute standards for our products, which will enable us to open up another important market.</p><h4>How significant is your expenditure on R&amp;D?</h4><p>When we decided to rehabilitate the production plant in Sumgait, we realized the importance of acquiring both national and international standards, as well as of the importance of quality and product control. We have set up a quality control system over the whole production chain, and we are constantly upgrading it, as well as purchasing the most modern equipment. We also set up our own laboratory facilities, where we test all our products. Another point is to have a qualified and experienced workforce to manage and control the quality process. Over the years we have obtained the ISO 9001:2008 certificate for management, and we are providing our employees with both national and international training courses, and in 2011 more than 20 people undertook professional courses outside the plant and 160 more gained specific skills qualifications. Also, Azerboru JSC has its own training center for our freshly hired employees. The fact that in 2011 we supplied our products to leading companies such as Lukoil, Gazprom, SOCAR, and Uzenmunaygaz without any quality complaints speaks volumes about the significance of our investment in these fields.</p><h4>What investment and growth plans does Azerboru JSC have for the future?</h4><p>In 2011 we tripled our annual production compared to our results in 2010 and we hired almost 300 people. Our main target for the near future is to increase production and sales, and so potentially we can increase production up to 600,000 tons a year and the number of employees by 50%. Since we are already producing different types of pipes, our aim is to widen our product portfolio beyond this product. Back in the old days, we used to produce steel billets, our raw material for the construction of pipes. However, we are not considering setting up a steel billet production line in the future, because we are closely working with Det.Al Holding, which has vast reserves of iron ore and is currently developing a major metallurgic project in Ganja, which will be fully operative in two to three years time, enabling us to acquire cheaper raw material inputs for our production.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have international chambers of commerce like AmCham contributed to the development of the business environment in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>Both the foreign business community and the business community in general have made a huge contribution in every respect to the development in this country, not just to the economy, but to political development and social development as well. Foreign companies have helped to introduce Kazakhstan to the world, and brought it into the new century. Having a foreign business community here early on has been very helpful in this regard. The oil majors, such as Chevron and Exxon, were the first to come here in the 1990s, and as the decade progressed, economic development became more open. Now, a host of sectors are emerging as growth engines. By about the mid-1990s Kazakhstan was beginning to emerge from its Soviet past. But then, in 1997, there was a crisis in the banking sector that reverberated regionally and globally. That was a blow to economic development, but Kazakhstan was quite lucky to have talented people in its own government early on—people like Grigory Marchenko, Governor of the National Bank, who was instrumental in creating a strong banking system for Kazakhstan that still exists today. AmCham was formed in 1999 from a core of 36 American members, but it has grown into an association of over 200 members today, a mixture of European, Middle Eastern, Asia-Pacific, American, and Kazakhstani member companies. Over half of our corporate members are major international companies from diverse industry sectors and national affiliations in the top tier of membership with annual revenue in excess of $100 million per year. From what we see day-to-day, the big market movers really have a lot to do in terms of Kazakhstan's development. They are vocal and AmCham ensures that their voices are heard at the very top where it matters. There are many investor issues that still require action. Foreign investors are active in this regard, and we see AmCham's responsibility as organizing their access to the very top policy-makers and supporting them in every way. But Kazakhstan is listening, and that is important.</p><h4>How does the growth of your member portfolio reflect Kazakhstan's economic development?</h4><p>As the largest and most influential foreign investor association in Kazakhstan, AmCham's membership portfolio becomes more and more diverse year by year. Even during the financial crisis, our membership grew 20% per year. In terms of national participation, only half the membership is American and we actively promote the international diversity of our membership. This lends an invaluable depth and breadth to our perspective and to our voice. In terms of sectors, the largest representation in AmCham after oil and gas is banking and consumer products, demonstrating the country's affluence. Luxury hotels, airlines, and financial services such as insurance and investment firms are major members, too. Accounting firms and law firms have more business than they can handle at the corporate level.</p><div class="quote">“AmCham's membership portfolio becomes more and more diverse year by year."</div><h4>In which areas do you think Kazakhstan needs to improve to ensure the continuity of foreign investment?</h4><p>Rule of law is probably at the top for AmCham members, along with anti-corruption, customs operations, taxation issues, and regional economic integration. If investors have a problem they need to feel that they can turn to the courts; that with legal representation they can receive a fair hearing and obtain a just solution to their problem. Unfortunately, that is not always the case. The judicial system does not always operate at the level that would be expected, particularly with relation to business disputes with the government. Too many disputes, including tax, environmental, administrative, and customs disputes, end up in the courts. Companies still make a lot of money here, and so they are willing to struggle through these various problems, but it's frustrating and difficult. We hear a lot about these problems at AmCham and we do our best to promote the creation of a better-functioning judicial system, including a system that will allow disputes to be settled amicably out of court. However, it is only fair to say that these challenges are not unique to Kazakhstan. Most of our major corporate members operate worldwide and are familiar with these issues as part of their operations.</p><h4>What role does AmCham play in developing the local business environment?</h4><p>AmCham has developed a very strong advocacy voice in recent years that allows us to speak on behalf of our members directly to the Prime Minister. We have specialized working groups composed of CEOs who write policy papers that we present to the Prime Minister and that are then discussed by the Group Chairmen with the relevant ministers. We also organize public conferences with broad attendance by the media on issues like rule of law and anti-corruption to encourage public discussion of these issues. These conferences involve government ministers and, when they are held in Astana, are broadly attended by the government and diplomatic corps. It is difficult for our members to work individually on these problems, and so it is the purpose of a business association like AmCham to bring the challenges they face out into the public arena and to the attention of the government, where steps can be taken for systemic change. A company can only fight for itself, but we can speak for any number of companies. As I said earlier, the government is listening and the relationship with the government of Kazakhstan is a good one. The government understands how important foreign investment is for Kazakhstan and knows that investors only come when the business environment is supportive. Kazakhstan has benefitted from foreign investment and shows respect for both investors and for AmCham as their representative.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-ring-of-copper-bells]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What main steps has Grupo Mexico-Minera Mexico (GM-MM) taken to become one of the biggest resource companies globally?</h4><p>Grupo Mexico has 65.4 million tons of copper reserves, and we are the fifth largest copper and the third largest molybdenum producer in the world. We have achieved this position because we have excellent methods to calculate our reserves, moreover we are continuously investing and exploring. The innovation applications in our operational model and the utilization of best practices are the key elements behind GM-MM's positioning as one of the largest mining corporations in the world. Hard work and strict planning are also key elements that have made Grupo Mexico what it is today.</p><h4>What is the distribution of your operations across Mexico, Peru, and the US?</h4><p>Around 80% of our revenue comes from copper, 7% comes from molybdenum, and the rest is derived from silver, zinc, and other metals. In the US we have three large open-pit mines, and we operate four open-pit mines in Peru and Mexico. The largest open-pit mine is Buenavista del Cobre in the northern part of Sonora, Mexico. The Quajone mine in Peru is about the same size. In addition to these we have five underground mines in Mexico.</p><h4>What is the production capacity of the Buenavista del Cobre copper mine?</h4><p>It's operating at full capacity, with additional projects to bring the total capacity of the mine from 190,000 tons of copper a year to 450,000 tons in the next four years. Around $3 billion will be invested in the expansion project. Buenavista del Cobre alone holds 25 million tons worth of copper reserves.</p><div class="quote">“There will continue to be growth in demand for commodities in the developing world and China."</div><h4>How does Grupo Mexico contribute to the international mining industry in terms of best practice and innovation?</h4><p>We extensively consider benchmarking an important way to control and improve our operations and we constantly invest in new technologies. We always follow the best practices and apply the latest techniques and methods; one of our core characteristics is our efficiency. As a result, our cost of production is one of the lowest in the word.</p><h4>How do you see the demand for resources evolving in the next five years, and what main trends can you identify?</h4><p>There will continue to be growth in demand for commodities in the developing world and China. Another factor is that the grade of ore is going down and reserves are falling. As a result, I think we have a bright future and that prices will rise as a result.</p><h4>How has Grupo Mexico developed over the years and what was its main strategy?</h4><p>In the past we were just a local mining company. Our plan was to first complete our program of integration to become a more balanced company that produced not only minerals, but also fine metals. We completed this part of our strategy in the 1990s. Then our goal was to diversify, so we entered the railroad business, becoming the largest railroad company in Mexico with 10,000 kilometers of main railroad tracks. Our final goal was to become international; we achieved this by acquiring ASARCO, which in 1965 owned 100% of Grupo Mexico. Today Grupo Mexico owns 100% of ASARCO. One of ASARCO's principal assets was its Peruvian mines, which were included in the acquisition.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of your operations in the region and the significance of Dubai in terms of your regional operations?</h4><p>We are the bank with the longest history in the Middle East, starting in Bahrain over 90 years ago and expanding into Jordan, Qatar, the UAE, Oman, and Lebanon. We were the first bank to receive a commercial banking license from the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC). We have the most senior management team among international banks in the region, including a member of the bank's main board of directors who works out of Dubai. We have the largest trading floor in the Middle East with 200 specialists focusing on commodities, currencies, and fixed income. Later in 2012 we are moving our UAE-focused staff into a brand new $140-million head office that will complement the regional DIFC office and our longstanding operations in Abu Dhabi. We have the largest retail banking network among international banks with 11 branches and more than 130 ATMs and cash deposit machines (CDMs).</p><h4>What is the core focus of your banking services in Dubai?</h4><p>We provide a wide range of conventional and Islamic wholesale and retail banking services. For our wholesale clients we provide world-class trade finance, clearing and settlement, and cash management services. We specialize in project finance, mergers and acquisitions, fixed income—including a leading debt capital markets division—currencies, and commodities. In retail banking our focus is on SMEs, private banking, and wealth management—with all products offered in both conventional and sharia-compliant forms depending on the customer's need. We pride ourselves on our customer service and continue to focus on our customers' specific needs and how they experience banking with us. Having the largest retail-banking network among international banks in the country means we are there for our customers wherever when they need banking services in the UAE and beyond.</p><div class="quote">“We have the most senior management team among international banks in the region."</div><h4>How do you leverage the bank's international reach in terms of offerings to your local clients?</h4><p>As an international bank with a focus on the world's most dynamic markets, we are well positioned to take advantage of the emerging trade and investment corridors of Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. Our strong on-the-ground presence in the markets we operate in allows us to have a deeper understanding of the business culture in each of our markets. We have around 2,500 people serving our clients in the UAE and beyond.</p><h4>How has your growth strategy for this region adjusted over recent years?</h4><p>Throughout the crisis, we remained open for business, and standing by our clients has deepened our partnership with them, helping us understand and identify their financial needs. Our deep understanding of the locals markets and strong commitment in challenging times has distinguished us from competitors.</p><h4>Where do you think the opportunities lie going forward?</h4><p>Differentiation remains the key issue in the Middle East, where the resource-rich economies are expected to show resilience, with growth decelerating only moderately in 2012 despite the economic slowdown in many of the Western economies. Higher oil prices bode well for government finances, enabling authorities to adopt counter-cyclical fiscal policies to stimulate growth as the West decelerates.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the Beirut Stock Exchange (BSE) contributed to Lebanon's economy over the past decade?</h4><p>Lebanon underwent a large-scale, multi-billion dollar reconstruction program over the past two decades, designed to restore Lebanon's former position as the financial and commercial capital of the Middle East. In addition, the Lebanese economy is characterized by its openness to trade in goods and services, a flexible exchange rate regime that accommodates external shocks, the absence of controls on capital flows, an unconditionally convertible currency, and a liberal and laissez-faire approach to economic policies. Moreover, the country has a tradition of having a stock exchange—the BSE—which is also called the Beirut Bourse. The BSE was established in 1920 and is considered to be one of the oldest stock exchanges in the region. Even though the reopening of the BSE in 1996 following the heavily militarized conflict was not that easy after a 13-year closure, one of our major priorities was to reorganize and modernize the regulations of the stock exchange and to make the BSE ready to play a major role in the development of the country, repatriating overseas Lebanese capital, channeling international portfolio investments, and providing an important source of funds in the short, medium, and long term that will be used for this purpose. In fact, the combined value of the securities listed on the BSE (excluding Lebanese Republic Eurobonds), rose from approximately $0.386 million in January 1996 to $11.3 billion at the end of June 2011. The number of authorized brokers rose from 5 to 16 and the number of listed instruments rose from 3 to 21 (excluding Eurobonds) over the same period.</p><h4>How are you looking to attract more local companies to list on the exchange?</h4><p>Lebanese businesses, both in the industrial and service sectors, are in their vast majority small family-owned firms, and therefore personal relationships between individual partners tend to prevail over other forms of interaction. Likewise, the Lebanese economy can be labeled as an “overdraft" economy, in which the activities of the major businesses are financed through bank credit. However, as a BSE Committee member, we are trying to correct the current situation by giving increasing attention to educational and promotional programs that aim to attract and convince medium-sized Lebanese companies to list their shares on the BSE and to increase their capital through the broadening of the shareholder base by highlighting the advantages and opportunities of financing through the stock exchange. On the other hand, we have worked closely with the Ministry of Finance and the Lebanese government to provide tax incentives for companies that list their shares on the BSE and to limit the distribution tax for listed companies to 5% instead of the 10% applied to other non-listed companies.</p><h4>What are the conditions for being listed on the BSE?</h4><p>Securities listed on the BSE are placed under one of three market sections depending on obligations undertaken by issuers and their respective levels of risks: the official market, the junior market, and the over-the-counter (OTC) market. Admission to any of these markets is granted by the BSE Committee after examination of an application file. It is important to note that the conditions for being listed on the BSE are the same for Lebanese companies as well as for foreign companies.</p><div class="quote">“The BSE was established in 1920 and is considered to be one of the oldest stock exchanges in the region."</div><h4>How can you entice companies to list on the BSE instead of going to other markets, like Dubai?</h4><p>Regional stock exchanges do not offer favorable terms over international exchanges, in my opinion. To become an international stock exchange we need to attract international companies to list on the BSE. Currently, we have cross listings with London and Luxembourg for Global Depository Receipts (GDRs). Companies that are listed on the London Stock Exchange or Luxembourg Stock Exchange have a greater outreach and more market opportunities to attract foreign investors.</p><h4>What new financial instruments are you looking to introduce?</h4><p>This will be left to the new market regulator, but we would certainly like to have more equity shares as well as new financial instruments. We don't like to have purely engineering structured instruments. Fortunately, the Banque du Liban has prevented these types of instruments, and that's why we were kept out of the financial crisis in 2008.</p><h4>What have you done to improve the trading structure and what is the significance of online trading?</h4><p>After the reopening of the BSE in 1996 we have dedicated ourselves to providing our customers with high-quality financial services. In serving this purpose we have moved from a fixed to a continuous trading system by implementing the NSC-UNIX trading system used and developed by NYSE-Euronext. We recently adopted an online trading system and developed an up-to-date website that provides an easy-to-use engine for investors searching for market data and listed companies' information. Likewise, we equipped a disaster recovery site outside of Beirut to be used in case of emergency.</p><h4>What changes would you like to see for the BSE in terms of supervision?</h4><p>A new law for Lebanon's financial markets has been recently approved by the parliament. The law takes into consideration the creation of a higher financial authority that oversees the regulation of the creation of various types of financial markets according to recognized international standards. The newly established authority will have sufficient independence in the exercise of its functions from any party involved in trading activities on the stock exchange. Likewise, the new law noted the necessity of separating the function of trading from other functions through the establishment of a separate body to oversee stock exchanges and financial markets in Lebanon, where the membership of the new body does not include the issuers of financial instruments or brokers at the stock exchanges.</p><p>The new body will be entrusted to license the establishment of exchanges or financial markets in Lebanon and the validity of market supervision and control. Likewise, the body will be entrusted to impose the general regulatory framework for the listing of financial instruments and to identify the publications and information to be provided for an initial public offering (IPO).</p><p>Currently, the Ministry of Finance oversees the activities of the BSE; however, the new Financial Market Law takes into consideration the privatization of the BSE within a one- to two-year period from the date of the establishment of the new Financial Market Authority.</p><h4>What prospective IPOs do you see for the BSE in 2011?</h4><p>During 2011 the Beirut Stock Exchange decided to accept the listing of additional shares issued by BLC Bank, Banque BEMO, as well as additional GDRs related to Bank Audi-Audi Saradar Group. Likewise, the BSE decided to accept the listing of the newly issued preferred shares class 2011 issued by BLOM Bank, as well as many issues of Lebanese treasury Eurobonds. On the other hand, Middle East Airlines, a private company owned by the Central Bank of Lebanon, has decided to list 25% of its share capital on the BSE; however, its management hasn't launched an IPO yet, and it has not taken any concrete measures to implement it so far.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>flydubai began operations in 2009 and has been hailed as the fastest growing airline start-up in history. What have been the key milestones in the development of the airline?</h4><p>Since the Government of Dubai announced in March 2008 that it was to launch a low-cost carrier there have been a number of milestones. In June 2008, flydubai announced a historic order for 50 Boeing 737-800 NG aircraft at the Farnborough Airshow. To date, we have received 21, with the rest due to be delivered before the end of 2016. Additionally, the aircraft we received in December 2011 was the 7000th 737 Boeing has delivered, which was a very exciting time for us, and it features special one-off livery. In terms of operations, June 1, 2009 was a historic day for flydubai, as the vision became reality when our first commercial flight took off to Beirut. With this, we had successfully turned the vision into reality. In the first 12 months of operations we carried more than 750,000 passengers and expanded our operational route network to 16 destinations. To date, we now have more than 45 operational destinations spanning 28 countries across the GCC, Middle East, Africa, Asia, the Asian subcontinent, and Central and Eastern Europe. Other significant developments also include taking the bold step of investing $20 million to bring all our engineering and maintenance facilities in house in April 2011. This was then followed by the launch of flydubai Cargo on 1January 2012, making the transportation of goods across the region via Dubai simple, accessible, and affordable. We have also pioneered in-flight entertainment systems, and became the first airline to offer high-definition films. We have achieved an incredible amount in less than three years of operation, and the team has worked very hard to make all of this possible and I look forward to many more milestones in the future.</p><h4>What factors have been instrumental in Dubai's success as an aviation hub?</h4><p>Dubai's geographical location makes it easily accessible from all corners of the globe. flydubai can reach one-third of the world's population within a five-hour flight, which equates to 2.5 billion people, so the potential for traffic is huge. But the growth of aviation in Dubai could not have been possible without the vision of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum and the Government of Dubai. This vision has helped make this city an aviation hub, popular with both transit passengers and those visiting the UAE for business or leisure and ensured flydubai got off to a flying start.</p><div class="quote">“The low-cost model is still relatively new for people in the Middle East, and we are working hard to educate passengers that low cost does not mean low quality."</div><h4>There is a remarkably low penetration level of low cost carriers in the region. Is there a cultural misunderstanding of low-cost airlines, and if so, what is your strategy to change popular perceptions of the industry?</h4><p>The low-cost model is still relatively new for people in the Middle East, and we are working hard to educate passengers that low cost does not mean low quality. We offer everything traditional airlines do, but at flydubai we do things differently. Our fares include everything a person needs to travel; i.e. the price of the seat, all taxes, and seven-kilogram hand luggage, with everything else, such as checked baggage, extra legroom seats, refreshments, and in-flight entertainment offered as optional extras. This allows passengers to control the price they pay. Furthermore, in the Middle East, low-cost travel accounts for just 7% of all air passenger traffic, compared to 35% in Europe or the US, so there is great potential for growth. We are expanding very quickly and our passengers are proof that people are open to the concept of low-cost travel. Our everyday low fares are also appealing as they mean more people are able to travel to more places, more often.</p><h4>In 2011 you launched three new routes into India. What opportunities do these developments represent for flydubai?</h4><p>India is a very important market for flydubai. Not only is there a large number of Indian expatriates living in the UAE, the majority of whom visit their home nation regularly, but the UAE is also a popular tourist destination for Indians, and therefore there is a lot of traffic between our two countries. flydubai is keen to increase its network in India and we are working with the relevant authorities to make this happen. Elsewhere, in 2012, we have launched operations to four new cities, Baghdad and Najaf in Iraq, Taif in Saudi Arabia, and the capital of the Kyrgyz Republic, Bishkek, and there will be more to come. Bishkek was the 50th destination we started flights to, which is an excellent achievement for us, having launched operations less than three years ago. We have marked many milestones and are delighted to have reached this point.</p><h4>In 2011 you established an in-house maintenance system. What has been the strategy behind this move, and other system developments?</h4><p>Once we had established operations and started to grow the fleet, it made financial and commercial sense for us to bring the operations in-house. We invested $20 million to provide a dedicated round-the-clock service to our rapidly growing fleet. A majority of this investment went into building dedicated facilities and purchasing equipment and IT systems, and the team has worked incredibly hard to make it happen and we have had a successful first year.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Dubai's continuing appeal to foreign investors?</h4><p>I think it is the positioning of Dubai more than anything else, that as a city it enables businesses not only to come and set up but also grow in the entire region. From Dubai you can reach out to a population of around 2.2 billion within four hours; this is very important for investors. Dubai represents, and is accepted as, a global services center to many multinationals looking at expanding their businesses in the region and globally.</p><h4>What measures have you taken to increase Dubai's appeal as a hub?</h4><p>We are focusing more on the central role of Dubai in the region. Our location has been key to our status as a hub, and we will continue to be important regionally and globally in the future, too. On the economic development front we are looking at best practices that we can learn from, while at the same time trying out new things boldly and being innovative in the way we develop our infrastructure to make it more appealing to businesses. We are also launching new campaigns across global media, and new success stories are being told to the world. In addition, the key economic messages of Dubai are delivered across bilateral and multinational platforms, such as delegation visits, missions, and conferences.</p><div class="quote">“Our location has been key to our status as a hub, and we will continue to be important regionally and globally."</div><h4>The Foreign Investment Office was set up recently under the umbrella of the Department of Economic Development (DED), along with three other connected organizations. What was the rationale behind this approach?</h4><p>The DED's role is to act as a catalyst for the business development programs the government, and while being a public body, it is strongly linked to the private sector, too. The DED is the licensing and regulatory body, and leads various economic development initiatives. The mission of Dubai FDI is well aligned with that of its sister agencies—Dubai Exports, Dubai SME, and Dubai Events &amp; Promotions—and also represents specific aspects of the DED's work. It is also part of the licensing function of the DED that eases procedures for setting up companies in Dubai.</p><h4>Did Dubai witness significant growth in FDI in 2011?</h4><p>In 2011 we saw an increasing number of investment enquiries compared to the previous year. Some of these enquiries led to new companies coming in, and while some are holding off for now, there is definitely growing interest. This is because people are seeing more encouraging news, better economic data, and realizing the uniqueness of Dubai as a global center. The trade balance is improving and the growth potential registered in 2010 is positive.</p><h4>Has the recent regional unrest had a direct impact on FDI flowing into Dubai?</h4><p>Regional unrest always creates a positive flow into surrounding markets that are stable and have sound fundamentals. It is important to note that Dubai has been a safe haven for investment for many years, and will continue to be a preferred investment destination, not so much due to regional unrest, but because of the underlying fundamentals driving the economy. Dubai has proven that it can compete on an international scale in times of global growth and in times of global decline, which is proof of a resilient economy.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[old-ties-new-directions]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Bank Misr Liban (BML) has been in the Lebanese market for a long time. What has been its core customer base over that time?</h4><p>BML was established in 1929 by Bank Misr Egypt and a number of leading businessmen in Lebanon and Syria, and set up branches in Beirut, Tripoli, and Damascus. When the United Arab Republic was formed in 1958, banking institutions in Egypt and Syria merged, and so the branches of Banque Misr in Syria became Bank Misr Egypt, and Banque Misr Syrie Liban became Banque Misr Liban, incorporating the Lebanese network. The bank was one of the major players in the market from 1929 until the early 1980s. Its customer base encompassed the largest companies and commercial enterprises, as well as the leading families in Lebanon and Syria, as well as high-net-worth individuals.</p><h4>How has BML looked to modernize itself as a sector player?</h4><p>The whole banking sector needed to adapt during the civil war. From the early 1980s to 2007, the bank developed slowly. Egypt went through economic reform and privatized all the banks except Banque Misr, Banque du Caire, and the National Bank of Egypt in 2005. Nonetheless, it was decided to make Banque Misr a private company with shares owned by the government, thus giving it the ability to restructure the bank completely. In 2007, it was decided to develop the bank's external network. I was recruited to restructure and upgrade Banque Misr Liban and return it to its position as a major player on the Lebanese market. At the beginning of 2007, there were no computers, telephones, or English-speaking employees in our branches. A major reorganization, refurbishment and modernization program has been implemented since then, guided by a new board of directors and implemented through the recruitment of a skilled and experienced management team. The result is that BML is now completely on par with its competitors.</p><h4>What has BML done to reassess its branch strategy?</h4><p>Originally, the bank had only five branches in Beirut. BML today has 15 branches across the country, but we are expanding the branch network gradually and will have 18 branches by the end of 2011. We have a strong presence in the regions, but fewer branches in the suburbs of Beirut and we are working to correct that. Economically speaking, 80% of Lebanon's GDP is produced in Beirut and its suburbs, with 20% coming from the rest of the country. This is why we are planning additional branches in Beirut and its suburbs as well as relocating some existing ones into more rapidly growing urban areas and commercial areas.</p><div class="quote">“I was recruited to restructure and upgrade Banque Misr Liban and return it to its position as a major player on the Lebanese market."</div><h4>How is the banking sector making use of the high levels of liquidity?</h4><p>The banks in Lebanon are facing a problem with regards to the use of the growing inflow of deposits because of the limited lending and investment opportunities on the local market, particularly taking account of risk management guidelines. We are looking for opportunities to finance more projects, and one of the more promising sectors remains the real estate development business and housing loans. There are also good opportunities in tourism projects, trade finance, and some industrial projects.</p><h4>What is BML's level of loan activity?</h4><p>We are always on the lookout for good projects and lending opportunities to expand our loan portfolio, but we are not able to provide as much finance as we would like because we might end up taking on too much risk. It is easy to get funding, but that means you have to be selective and vet all operations before investing these funds.</p><h4>BML was part of a number of Lebanese banks that financed the purchase of Medgulf Insurance. What was the magnitude of this deal?</h4><p>The deal is important. Medgulf was a company owned by LFZ Holding and Saudi Oger. They decided that one party would have the choice to buy or sell to the other party. LFZ Holding decided to acquire the whole company and asked a group of banks headed by Deutsche Bank in Dubai and Bank Audi to finance and participate in that acquisition. The insurance company, which is number one in Lebanon and number two in Saudi Arabia, was appraised at more than $1 billion. It was a very good deal. Some of the banks were Saudi, but most were Lebanese as Medgulf is basically a Lebanese company.</p><h4>The Lebanese economy has seen a change in the dollarization rate. What is the country's reliance on the dollar?</h4><p>The dollarization rate changed from 63% to 66%. The Lebanese economy is very much dollarized and most transactions can be denominated in US dollars, except for taxes and public sector and most private sector salaries, which are in Lebanese pounds. Any real estate deal is normally done in US dollars, and this has been the case for the last 20 years. This is why Banque du Liban has been promoting the wider use of the Lebanese pound in recent years by subsidizing housing loans and university tuition loans in Lebanese pounds.</p><h4>What reforms can the government introduce to tackle the debt-to-GDP ratio?</h4><p>The government has many options for significant reforms to decrease the country's debt. Many of these options were included in the program of reforms that was initiated to comply with the Paris I, II, and III requirements, but are still far from being completed.  We have many sectors that need to be privatized, including the national airline company, Middle East Airlines. It is publicly owned because this company faced so many problems and the government had to ask Banque du Liban to take it over. We have to look to restructure our energy sector and we have to privatize the fixed and mobile phone networks because it is abnormal for these to be owned by the government. The private sector has proved that it can successfully manage these operations.</p><h4>How is BML, as part of the finance sector, maintaining its prudential nature?</h4><p>The banking sector has proved to be quite immune to adverse developments in Lebanon and the region. The sector has faced many problems, but is still dynamic, sound, and profitable. We are among the leading countries in applying Basel III requirements. If you look at the accounts of our bank for 2010, it's clear that we have prematurely met international standards. I know that by 2013 we will satisfy tier-one capital and shareholder equity guidelines. There are continuing discussions between banks and the Banking Control Commission at the Banque du Liban to speed up the implementation of all Basel II and III requirements. Immunity in the end is a matter of organization, and prudential rules have to be part of the setup of an institution and its culture.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will SGBL's acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of the Lebanese-Canadian Bank (LCB) impact your operations in Lebanon?</h4><p>SGBL acquired certain assets and liabilities of the Lebanese-Canadian Bank after an account screening process based on Société Générale Group's standards. The acquisition of these assets and liabilities has increased our group assets to slightly over $11 billion, leading SGBL to rank fifth of sixth among Lebanese banks, up from ninth position. At the domestic level, the operation has allowed us to develop our branch network to better cover Lebanese territory; we now operate 78 branches, up from 43. However, most importantly, the acquisition will enable us to strengthen and develop our core business lines, including retail, corporate, and private banking thanks to a broader customer base, both inside and outside Lebanon. Not only do the new clients who have joined SGBL as a consequence of the acquisition bolster our client base, but they also contribute to diversifying it. Indeed, our newly acquired clientele allows for better risk diversification within SGBL's portfolio, and greater involvement in the Lebanese economy for our bank. We also believe that our broad product and service range will appeal to our new clients and will boost our performance, and we are putting in all the necessary efforts to give them the satisfaction that they deserve. On another level, the acquisition of some of the assets and liabilities of the Lebanese-Canadian Bank opens up new horizons for developing our customer base abroad. Indeed, some of the assets acquired relate to non-resident clients, namely based in some African countries. We have long since believed the Lebanese diaspora to represent one of the major growth opportunities for our group, and are therefore banking on this new portfolio of non-resident clients to further tap new markets. Overall, we are confident that our continuous quest for client satisfaction and our drive for quality will be the engine for growth, both domestically and internationally. In terms of efficiency, the acquisition is expected to generate economies of scale as well as synergies, both of which should support the quality of our products and services, the profitability of our businesses, as well as the cohesion of our teams.</p><h4>SGBL recently acquired a majority stake in Société Générale Cyprus as well as raised its stake in its Jordanian subsidiary. What is the significance of these markets for SGBL's overall operations?</h4><p>SGBL Group is a regional banking and insurance group. We also belong to Société Générale Group, which is a large financial group at the international level. This gives us invaluable support and an international platform to work on. This belonging is, in itself, an opportunity for business development and growth worldwide. Although Société Générale Bank in Jordan (SGBJ) is still a relatively small entity as compared to major market players in the Kingdom, we perceive Jordan as being a key market for us. We entered the Jordanian market 10 years ago and we strongly believe that the Kingdom offers strong potential for growth, both in the banking business as well as in our other business lines, at the top of which is insurance. Beyond that, we are confident that our presence in Jordan will enable us to reach new markets from our Jordanian base. To start with, Iraq and the Palestinian territories are markets that we believe have high potential. That is why we set an ambitious action plan for SGBJ a few years back, supporting human resource development, consolidating our presence in the market, and strengthening our competitive edge as a retail and corporate bank. The plan has started to yield fruit, and we hope to take our ambitions to the next level soon. As for our recent penetration of the Cypriot market, it has indeed been a major step forward for our group. The acquisition of Société Générale Cyprus has introduced the group into Europe, thus also paving the way for future growth prospects, this time in the European market. Cyprus' vicinity to Lebanon and its position in Europe give it outstanding advantages that have already allowed SGBL Group to tap new business opportunities.</p><h4>What factors do you feel have contributed most to overall deposit growth in Lebanon over the last few years?</h4><p>First, it is worth mentioning that Lebanon's deposit base is practically three times the country's GDP. It is made up of 80% resident deposits and 20% non-resident. In particular, the non-resident deposit component has been increasing steadily, especially since 2008, with savings fleeing from shaky markets into what was perceived as a safe haven. The rocketing of oil prices also drove Arab deposits into Lebanon and gave momentum to the economy as a whole. But besides being driven by international economic developments, Lebanon's deposits are strongly correlated to the domestic political and economic scenes. Lebanon has been registering robust growth since 2007, and our balance of payments has registered historical surpluses as confidence strengthened and the country's risk perception was subdued by a stable political environment and good economic performance.</p><div class="quote">“We are confident that our continuous quest for client satisfaction and our drive for quality will be the engines for growth."</div><h4>What is your forecast for continued deposit growth, and what does this signal for corollary loan growth?</h4><p>Deposits have increased at a strong pace in recent years; they rose by 20% on average per year between 2008 and 2010, bolstered by the international financial crisis. In 2011, we expect growth to come back to more realistic and average levels—around 8% in the sector. On the one hand, the economic slump in most of the leading economies, and on the other hand, a troubled situation in a major part of the Arab world, have had a direct impact on Lebanon, both at the level of the real economy and at the banking level. Still, it is unlikely that this relatively weaker growth in deposits will affect loan growth. In fact, loan growth has reached around 24% per year on average if we consider the last three years, thus slightly higher than deposit growth, as it was driven by economic momentum and an overall improvement in sovereign risk. Although they have typically privileged public sector lending for many years, Lebanese banks have been gradually turning to private sector lending as sovereign risk diminished and yields on government paper shrank. Both the retail and corporate industries have benefited from this strategic shift in bankers' behavior. This trend is expected to continue as long as Lebanon's political scene remains stable or better still, if it improves. It might even become more sustained should the government embark seriously on much needed reform and restructuring programs that would help support the country's investment framework.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been landmark achievements of Royal Bank since it was established in 1993?</h4><p>I basically acquired the bank at the end of 2003. At the time we had one office and around 13 people in employment. The development of the country was so strong I couldn't keep myself out of the current, and it is that current that has brought us to where we are today. Starting at the beginning of 2004, we began developing the core strategies that would drive the bank's penetration of Azerbaijani society. Back then we focused on the retail business and proceeded to expand the number of branches in the country. Currently, Royal Bank has 32 branches and nine sub-branches. In addition, we now have 630 employees. During the last few years, we have been growing at a faster pace than Azerbaijan's GDP; 207% in 2007, 179% in 2008, 89% in 2009, and then due to the crisis in the banking sector we focused on consolidating our achievements. Royal Bank's assets are close to $250 million, its deposits are at about $100 million, and its portfolio is around $120 million. Fortunately, the economic policies implemented by both President Ilham Aliyev and his team—as well as the Central Bank of Azerbaijan (CBAR)—have been really successful and have protected our banks from the crisis, keeping them on their feet.</p><h4>What activities is Royal Bank specialized in?</h4><p>Around 90% of our clients are in the retail segment; only 10% are corporate clients. That drives us to be a bank highly specialized in retail services such as loans and credit cards. Our main corporate clients are SMEs, and we have a special department that provides funds to SMEs.</p><div class="quote">“The Azerbaijani banks are now in a much better position than their regional counterparts."</div><h4>What are your views on the state of development in the banking sector in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Thanks to CBAR's guidance, the Azerbaijani banks are now in a much better position than their regional counterparts. Azerbaijan, as a young country with a young banking sector, has a lot to learn from our fellow bankers in the West and the Middle East. In order to achieve this, Royal Bank opened a new bank in Dubai called Royal Investment Bank in 2011. It is an independent entity, but it is basically a way for us to gain more experience from the banking sector in the Middle East and expand our vision to North Africa as well. It is important for us to think regionally rather than locally.</p><h4>What is your development strategy and plan for future years to leverage your capabilities?</h4><p>We are concentrating on the credit card business, which is a new area of banking for us. At this point we are also focusing on getting a forex system installed in order to attract local and regional market participants. We are doing this in collaboration with a Swiss bank. Royal Bank is, at the same time, in the process of establishing the technical aspects of banking. We are also very interested in further developing trade financing links between Caspian and Black Sea countries. We think that since the landscape of the banking system has been damaged by the crisis at the international level, the new landscape will form itself. We are trying to move wisely in order to take our place in that new landscape when all the players become involved. The crisis has created pain on the one hand, but also lots of opportunities that can be seen as challenges.</p><h4>What are your views on CBAR's increasing efforts to bring the credit card market to international standards and make it safer?</h4><p>CBAR is learning from the international market and globally the trend is toward e-commerce and non-cash transactions. CBAR is implementing new rules and regulations in the field, and it is in constant contact with banks including ours. Royal Bank has its own card-processing center with lines for Visa, Mastercard, JCB, and China Union Pay. We are the only bank in Azerbaijan that has lines with JCB and China Union Pay.</p><h4>What's your general outlook for the financial sector in the years to come?</h4><p>I am very positive; I think that from a geopolitical point of view we are a rather small but strong country. We have two big neighbors, one in the north and the other in the south, with big economies that have to deal with. Azerbaijan is in a great position and the financial sector is a key one. We are in a privileged position and the times ahead are quite exciting. I think when the West gets back on its feet, the Azerbaijani banking sector will grow even stronger, because we are headed in the right direction.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Ateshgah's insurance premiums amounted to AZN18.5 million by January 2012. How has the company sought to position itself in the market?</h4><p>Ateshgah Insurance Company was established in 1996, and in December 2011 we celebrated our 15th anniversary. Ateshgah initially functioned as a company totally focused on the corporate segment. New legislation that came into force demanded the separation of company activities into life and non-life lines by establishing separate life insurance companies. For this reason, in 2009 Ateshgah created the first specialized life insurance company in Azerbaijan: Ateshgah Life. In the same year we consolidated all our insurance companies into the Ateshgah Insurance Group of Companies. Having more than 15 years of history in the Azerbaijani market, Ateshgah Insurance currently holds the leading position in the insurance industry and has licenses for more than 20 types of insurance activities. In 1998 there were only 15 employees at Ateshgah, but now there are almost 300 employees including all the offices throughout the country. During 2011 we signed more than 72,000 new insurance contracts, which exceeded the previous year's result by more than 60%. Our success, to a great extent, depends on our counterparts. That's why we are very selective and maintain high standards for our reinsurance and brokerage partners. For example, our key partners include Hannover Re (Germany), SCOR (France), Swiss Re (Switzerland), Munich Re (Germany), and ROSNO (Russia).</p><h4>How will recent changes in Azerbaijani insurance laws and the increase of compulsory product lines impact Ateshgah and the sector as a whole?</h4><p>Due to the historical development curve of the insurance industry, we were behind other countries in the greater region. However, our growth rate has transformed into one of the highest in countries with transitional economies. There are two major indicators to assess the inclusion of insurance services in a country: gross written premiums over GDP, which is called insurance market penetration, and gross written premiums per capita. For example, our insurance market penetration lags behind Kazakhstan's by 50%. Even in developed countries, the popularity of insurance products in modern society is due to the adoption of compulsory insurance laws. From an economic rationale, compulsory types of insurance guarantee citizens security from unusual but inevitable events—the byproducts of substantial growth, which our economy currently experiences. The latest two compulsory insurance legislation acts, including for industrial accidents, have accelerated the growth rate of the insurance industry. The law on compulsory types of insurance covers four types of insurance: immobile property, passenger, fire protection, and third-party motor liability. All these compulsory insurance types have a huge impact on instilling a culture of using insurance products in our country. Ateshgah, among other leading insurance companies, put a lot of effort into the development of these legislative initiatives by actively participating in working groups and examining international experiences. When it comes to our market penetration, we believe we will be able to increase our share up to 15%.</p><h4>Ateshgah insured the face of the winner of Eurovision 2011, Nigar Jamal, the first instance of exclusive insurance in the industry. Its portfolio also includes the “Temple of Fire." How are such high profile elements placed within your business strategy?</h4><p>Our vision is to remain the leader in the financial services sector due to innovative business practices, while contributing to the preservation of Azerbaijan's cultural heritage as well as a prosperous and environmentally clean future. The promotion of the country and preservation of our cultural heritage is a social responsibility for our company. We believe that the victory of our representatives in Eurovision is a good avenue for every Azerbaijani to promote this country. We decided to take this chance in order to promote our country and meanwhile increase our brand awareness. The “Temple of Fire" is a unique piece of Azerbaijani heritage, which is also part of our country's branding activities. We decided to insure it for $3 million at our expense, and the Ministry of Tourism is the beneficiary of this deal.</p><div class="quote">“During 2011 we signed more than 72,000 new insurance contracts."</div><h4>What is your economic outlook for 2012? How do you see the size, nature, and direction of the Azerbaijan insurance market evolving in the upcoming years?</h4><p>According to the projections of the Ministry of Finance, total written premiums in 2012 will reach around AZN280 million-AZN300 million. In 2011 this indicator was AZN213 million, increasing more than 37% over 2010. The primary source of growth will come from compulsory types of insurance. If we examine the development of insurance industries in the CIS region and Eastern European countries, you can see that the implementation of compulsory insurance gave the sector a push, and 2012 promises to be a very interesting year for the insurance market in this respect. Also, interest from multinationals engaged in the insurance business will foster the institutional development of the local market. Insurance companies will start implementing best business practices and the latest technologies. The insurance industry will keep growing at an extremely high rate in the coming years.</p><h4>What kind of business opportunities do you see for foreign investors in the Azerbaijani insurance market?</h4><p>Our country generates almost 85% of the GDP of the Caucasus region. There is a consistent economic policy to decrease the oil dependence of the country. There are many opportunities for foreign investors in any field of our country's economy, especially in industry. High real returns, which are possible in our economy, are an attractive element for foreign investors. Much has been invested in infrastructure, especially the development of roads and the redevelopment of urban and rural areas. These are only a few of the factors attracting foreign investors. Having said that, I believe we need to develop the equity markets through reforms in order to make our investment climate even friendlier to foreigners.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the main challenges for Mapfre when it decided to acquire Atlas and enter the Ecuadorean market?</h4><p>The acquisition was made in 2008 and we were obligated to make Mapfre Atlas follow the same business model that Mapfre uses around the world. Atlas was a very solvent company, but too corporate oriented and too heavily focused on Guayaquil. The challenge was to implement the Mapfre model, which has a more national scope; we are interested in doing business across the country and expanding our product lines, not just in corporate products, but also in individual insurance lines. We are also working to diversify our sales channels. The main points of sale were our brokers. We have maintained these brokers, and are expanding their numbers, but we also wanted to make agreements with banks and other entities. In terms of corporate culture, we have adapted a code and the staff has gladly accepted the changes, seeing them as beneficial.</p><h4>How would you summarize the opportunities present in Ecuador for insurance companies?</h4><p>Ecuador, from an insurance point of view, and considering other economic indices, ranks in the middle of Latin American countries. For a market that is valued at approximately $1.3 billion, there are a lot of insurance companies present. In Ecuador, there are 45 insurance firms, which is unnecessary, and far from being good for competition. It has restrained the sector from being as innovative as it could be. Ongoing legislative changes, including an anti-monopoly law that obliges banks to sell any non-financial businesses they own, will encourage consolidation in the market. I firmly believe that there are opportunities for insurance businesses that are committed to growth.</p><div class="quote">“The main points of sale were our brokers. We have maintained these brokers, and are expanding their numbers."</div><h4>How do you think Mapfre can contribute with innovation and expertise to the insurance sector in Ecuador?</h4><p>In the short time we have been operating here we have become the company that has launched the most products in the market, that has trained the largest amount of brokers (the intermediaries of the business), and we are also the company that invests the most in the training of its employees. We are also working closely with clients to explain our new services and also discuss risk management. We are currently undergoing a period of innovation that involves an investment of around $700,000 in technology that will make the issuing of contracts easier for the clients and more efficient for the company. It has not been necessary up until now to introduce such policies in Ecuador. There is also a lack of talent in the market due to a lack of experience in operating a high-tech insurance firm.</p><h4>What products have you worked on for individual clients?</h4><p>Historically, more of the 80% of our portfolio of clients was corporate. Our only individual clients were businessmen to whom we offered a few products, but there never was any real effort made to attack this market segment. Since the arrival of Mapfre we have started analyzing the needs of Ecuadorean customers, and we noticed that, for example, every company offered the same products, yet a price war was taking place. We thus decided to launch two car insurance policies for individual customers. Right now our policy is the best in the market; it gathers the best services, and boasts great coverage. We have added mechanical damage to the standard package, and this is unique. This package has become more in demand than basic coverage packages. We have also tailored products that take into account the age of the car. Our plan is to segment the market and contribute with different products. In general insurance, we have further policies covering domestic risks, both individual and collective medical plans, life insurance, accident insurance, and dental insurance. Our goal is to satisfy the needs of the Ecuadorean market. We don't copy what the rest of the insurance companies are doing; we are not interested in that. We strive to identify the needs of our clients and create insurance products specially tailored for them</p><h4>What are your objectives for the 2012 period?</h4><p>We have 12 goals in total. We want to increase our market share and raise awareness of Mapfre Atlas in Ecuador. Our goal is to expand both in results and in policies. In 2012, we aim to consolidate what we have been working on, given that the past year was full of changes and the launching of new products. Besides two specific projects that we have been developing, we don't plan to launch any new products in early 2012. I think we have covered everything the Ecuadorean market demands right now. We also plan to automate the company so that the entire technological process is business and customer service oriented. We plan to keep expanding our offices because we want to be closer to our clients. We want to have 12 offices by the end of 2012; we currently have eight. Additionally, we want to keep improving the claims process. Atlas is very well trusted when it comes to paying claims, which is the most important issue for insurance companies. We offer a good level of service, but we want to become more efficient. Another important part of this picture is human resources; being a multinational company means observing the rights of our employees, something we strive to respect.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

What have been the defining elements of the country's vision with regard to integration into the global economy?<br></h4><p>Since independence, President Nazarbayev's policy has been to diversify the economy and create ties with trading partners. This policy has been successful and well balanced. We work in cooperation with the EU, which is Kazakhstan's biggest trade partner. We would like to be a platform and a hub for European activity in Central Asia. We have had long and fruitful relations with Russia and other CIS countries, and that has kept economic relations positive. With the implementation of the Customs Union, we are moving closer to the Belarusian and Russian economies. We hope to expand this into a Eurasian Economic Community and Unique Economic Space in the future. We also have very strong relations with our neighbor China, and we are working on large-scale projects to build gas pipelines and a highway from China to Europe across Kazakhstan. We are also cooperating with our eastern neighbor under the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. In relation to foreign economic relations, we have attracted $120 billion of FDI over the last two decades. Among our investors are large US companies like Chevron, and very influential European companies such as Total and ENI.</p><p>In 2010, GDP growth reached 7%. We anticipate similar growth over the upcoming years. GDP per capita will also be around $15,000. These figures outstrip all the other Central Asian countries combined.</p><p>Additionally, in 2010, Kazakhstan took over the OSCE chairmanship, and the annual OSCE meeting was held in Astana in 2010, which was a superb opportunity to show off the development Kazakhstan has undergone. A recent European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) meeting held in Astana also showed off the investment potential of the country. Nearly 2,500 guests and participants were in attendance.</p><div class="quote">“We would like to be a platform and a hub for European activity in Central Asia."</div><h4></h4><h4>What were some of the key measures the government took to alleviate the effects of the global financial crisis on the local economy?</h4><p>Kazakhstan felt the first signs of the financial crisis before other CIS countries because its banking sector was very closely linked to the financial institutions of Western countries. From the beginning of 2007 we experienced problems in the financial system when Lehman Brothers collapsed. Steps were taken by the President to join the two funds, Samruk and Kazyna. Additionally, $10 billion was allocated for anti-crisis measures, and this played a big role in strengthening the economy. We have used the financial resources of our National Stabilization Fund, which is an analog of the Government Pension Fund of Norway, to store extra oil revenues. The national welfare fund Samruk-Kazyna, after becoming the anti-crisis operator of the government, did a great job in solving the problems of the banking sector, the construction sector, SMEs, and the industrial sector. These sectors of the economy suffered the most from the crisis. The four largest banks in the country have avoided financial problems, and some of them even avoided collapse during this period. I should mention that they had debts of more than $40 billion. We started discussions with creditors on restructuring the debts of the banks, and after 18 months of discussions agreements were made. We have stabilized the finance sector of the country and kept the trust of the population in the banks.</p><p>In 2008-2009, the most pressing issue for entrepreneurs was the rise in interest rates on credits. The state conducted a refinancing of earlier granted credits and a lowering of rates on new loans for business start-ups and development. It supported more than 10,000 businesses, creating and maintaining more than 19,000 work places over the last four years. Construction and real estate companies received finance from the anti-crisis operator, and this has helped to stabilize and boost the sector.</p><h4>How would you assess Kazakhstan's strengths and prospects in the Customs Union?</h4><p>The Customs Union is a big event in the economic lives of Kazakhstan, Belarus, and Russia. It has brought a new dynamic to our relations. The implementation of the Customs Union began in 2010, and according to the latest statistics internal trade has grown 30% between Russia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan. It is a huge market of 170 million people, and Kazakhstan's large companies and SMEs will get an opportunity to export their products to this large market. All companies will be granted equal access to infrastructure, to the market, and to new technologies, promoting joint projects and joint ventures. This will be key in developing our competitiveness. It is absolutely evident that the Customs Union will give us more opportunities.</p><h4>According to the World Bank's Doing Business 2011 report, Kazakhstan is one of the top reformers in the world. What were some of the key policy decisions taken and reforms made to achieve this improved status?</h4><p>We have done all we can to create a comfortable and easy environment for investors to operate within. This has been accomplished by creating predictable rules for investors. There has also been an increase in the number of economic and business conferences held here in Kazakhstan, and this has been positive. The special Foreign Investment Council under the President works to achieve these goals, and all key investors meet twice a year and discuss the challenges that are faced and solutions are found. We are striving to create a better investment climate. We are now also working to improve the legal atmosphere and develop the visa regime, as well as the customs regimes. In terms of improving business procedures, a program is being implemented by the government to reduce bureaucracy. The number of licenses and permissions required to operate a business will be cut. This will help to attract more investment, both domestic and foreign.</p><h4>Kazakhstan has a comprehensive agenda to diversify its economy through accelerated industrialization. In which non-prime sectors of the economy does Kazakhstan have the strongest competitive edge?</h4><p>Having recovered from the crisis, Kazakhstan is now moving into a post-crisis development phase, with a large emphasis on infrastructure and investment projects within the framework of diversifying the economy. Kazakhstan's post-crisis concentration will also be on motivating large investors and national companies to launch joint strategies and mutually linked industrial projects. We will also continue to focus on investment projects in basic industries such as oil and gas, mining, uranium, and the chemical industry. Now, our main task is to use our competitive advantages in the raw material sectors; for instance, if we have an oil and gas resource, we should develop a refinery, and develop the petrochemical and chemical sector. Likewise, we have to develop a modern metallurgy sector to complement the mining sector. Also, we should develop the atomic energy sector to take advantage of our uranium reserves. Kazakhstan has one of the world's largest reserves and is on track to become the world's largest uranium producer. In accordance with basic industries we need to develop all the required infrastructure, including transport, telecommunications, and electricity supply. Both directions help to build up a strong and competitive economy. The most promising sector of our economy is the agriculture sector. This country is among the top 10 exporters of grain in the world. In that respect, we aim to be a big exporter of agri-food products and grain to our powerful neighbors such as Russia and China.</p><h4>How much of a role do you see for foreign investors in this industrialization process?</h4><p>Among the investors that are involved in our industrialization program are Western as well as Eastern companies. We have taken great strides to attract foreign investment, and through a joint venture with General Electric we have constructed a locomotive factory in the capital. Additionally, European companies such as Alstom, Finmeccanica, and Siemens are looking to play a part in the development of infrastructure projects in Kazakhstan. Areva is another company looking to establish a joint venture here, knowing that it can export its products easily to India and China. Through a reorganization of our financial sector, the development of transport infrastructure, and investment in core industries, we expect even more interest from foreign companies.</p><p>Additionally, Kazyna Capital Management is responsible for attracting investments and creating joint ventures with foreign companies. Such joint ventures have been established with the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and Citic Group from China at values of $500 million and $1 billion, respectively.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Esteemed Mr. President, how would you assess the success of the implementation of Kazakhstan's accelerated industrial-innovation development plan? What has been achieved and what remains to be done?</h4><p>Accelerated industrialization is a step forward; one of the main thoroughfares of Kazakhstan's journey into the 21st century. The whole of Kazakhstan is overlaid with this idea. The industrial might of the country is growing stronger before our eyes.</p><p>At this moment, in the framework of the Industrialization Map, by 2015 some 469 investment projects worth $56.7 billion are planned. There will be more than 300,000 jobs created. In 2010 we opened 152 facilities worth $5.5 billion, and 23,000 Kazakhstanis found permanent employment.</p><p>In the first half of 2011, 75 investment projects worth $778 million were implemented. More than 6,000 Kazakhstanis found a stable source of income. By the end of the year, some 130 projects worth $4.2 billion will be completed.</p><div class="quote">“Achieving a European standard of living constitutes the main task of social modernization."</div><p>We are already observing the positive effects of the measures we have taken. According to the statistics, over the first half of 2011 Kazakhstan's GDP grew by 7%. Industrial production is up by 5.8%, while growth in the manufacturing industry stood at 8.7%. Unemployment decreased to 5.4%. With the entry of new businesses at full capacity, many more socio-economic indicators will improve.</p><h4>In your state of the union address at the beginning of 2011 you announced a comprehensive social modernization program. What work is being done in this direction?</h4><p>The main criterion for assessing the success of a country is the wellbeing of its citizens. Therefore, for us, achieving a European standard of living constitutes the main task of social modernization. We will enhance the quality of the education system, health care, and employment. The living standards for all of Kazakhstan's citizens will be improved.</p><p>Over 2011 the pensions, allowances, and salaries of civil servants increased by 30%. Soon we will hold the first “People's IPO". The general public of Kazakhstan will be able to purchase shares in national companies and invest in the domestic economy.</p><p>Social modernization will enable us to significantly improve the quality of our human capital. By 2016, spending on education will reach 5% of GDP. Across the country, we will build 400 new schools. There will be 350 new healthcare facilities. By 2020, the population will be close to 18 million and the life expectancy of Kazakhstanis will increase to 72 years. We will build 6 million square meters of housing each year.</p><p>Across the entire country, new schools, hospitals, stadiums, and housing facilities are under construction. Since 2010 in Astana, Nazarbayev University has been successfully operating. It is the largest science and education complex in Central Asia.</p><h4>Can the last presidential elections and the upcoming parliamentary elections be considered as additional steps in the modernization of Kazakhstan's political system?</h4><p>Holding free and fair elections is one of the most important features of a democratic state. Kazakhstan, from the very beginning, has been following this path, acting according to a formula of “stability through tolerance, modernization through liberalization".</p><p>The last presidential election was held in the year of the 20th anniversary of our independence. Observers and journalists came from all over the world. The electoral process took place at the highest level.</p><p>I am convinced that the upcoming parliamentary elections will be held in a similar fashion. After these elections, at least two parties will be represented in the Majilis. Such are the requirements of our legislation.</p><p>The further modernization of the political system is designed to expand the powers of the government and the parliament. We are improving the quality of the judicial system, as well as local and central state organs and authorities. We are enhancing the role of political parties and the mass media in the public interest. I have recently approved the concept of a new public service model. The administrative apparatus will undergo serious reform. Emphasis will be placed on implementing the principles of corporate governance and accountability.</p><h4>Mr. President, you are the author of many initiatives of international worth. In 2010, Astana hosted the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) summit, while in 2011 Kazakhstan is the chair of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC). What measures do you think will help to bring together the East and the West?</h4><p>Kazakhstan chaired the OSCE and OIC thanks to its tremendous contribution in strengthening international stability and the high level of confidence it has  received  from the global community. Our country is the locomotive of integration in Eurasia. Since ancient times, trade routes have intersected on Kazakh soil, and the interaction of different cultures and religions took place. Today mosques, synagogues and churches peacefully coexist alongside each other. Every three years we organize a congress for the leaders of global and traditional religions.</p><p>In modern day Kazakhstan, the representatives of 140 ethnicities and 46 confessions live in an unbreakable unity. All of them are involved in the construction of Kazakhstan's statehood. The peoples of many different origins glorify the Republic of Kazakhstan with their achievements. Strengthening intercultural dialogue is one of the biggest challenges of our times. All peoples have the right to freely develop their own language and culture. Any attempt to provoke conflicts on ethnic or religious grounds should be severely punished.</p><p>Peace between different peoples does not occur by itself. It is a result of thoroughly thought out and balanced policies.</p><p>In 2011, the Seventh World Islamic Economic Forum (WIEF) took place in Astana. Kazakhstan became the first Central Asian state to organize the “Islamic Davos". At this meeting, issues concerning global economic development were addressed. I believe that the mutual adaptation of the economic systems of the East and West can provide a solid foundation for dialogue between the two civilizations.</p><h4>What is your vision for Kazakhstan's future?</h4><p>We are living in exciting times, when the distance between the most audacious ideas and objective reality is shrinking at an incredible speed. It almost seems like yesterday that there was no sovereign Kazakhstan. And yet, in December 2011, the Republic will celebrate 20 years of independence.</p><p>We started to create a country from scratch, and have never been afraid to set ourselves the most ambitious objectives. Over the years, we have built a prosperous nation and a dynamic economy. Kazakhstan enjoys the respect of the international community. The prosperity of our citizens is growing. Our young capital, Astana, has become one of the most beautiful cities in Eurasia.</p><p>In 1997, we adopted the Kazakhstan Development Strategy for 2030, and since then we have consistently been achieving the objectives set down in this strategy.  Our strategic priority is to diversify the economy. Within five years the share of the manufacturing sector in the structure of the country's GDP will be no less than 12.5%. The share of non-oil exports will increase to 40%. Labor productivity will increase by a factor of 1.5 in manufacturing, and by a factor of two in agriculture.</p><p>We will carry out a fundamental modernization of the economy. We have all the necessary natural, infrastructural and, most importantly, human resources to achieve this.</p><p>In Kazakhstan the new generation born since independence has grown up. Our successes and achievements are helping to raise the self-confidence, desire for change, new victories, and achievements of Kazakhstan's youth. Our youth are ready to continue the great cause of building a prosperous Kazakhstan.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>The relations linking Russia and Kazakhstan are long term and stable. HE President Nursultan Nazarbayev and I see each other frequently and use each summit, each meeting, as a chance to exchange views on the development of our bilateral relations. This allows us to maintain their dynamics.<br></p><p>HE President Nazarbayev's wealth of political experience and dynamic and fruitful work as President of Kazakhstan have helped to bring Kazakhstan impressive success in its socio-economic development and a good reputation on the international stage.</p><p>I especially note His Excellency's contribution to advancing the multifaceted strategic partnership between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Kazakhstan. I highly value the warm ties that we have, for they form a solid foundation for our trusting and constructive discussions and help us to make decisions on the most important issues before us on the bilateral and international agendas. I am sure that our intensive and productive political dialogue will continue to play a key part in consistently developing all aspects of the alliance between our countries and carrying out major projects in the various fields of mutual interest.</p><div class="quote">“In December 2010 we signed the Joint Action Plan for 2011-2012, which will allow Russia and Kazakhstan to work as planned."</div><p>In December 2010 we signed the Joint Action Plan for 2011-2012, which will allow Russia and Kazakhstan to work as planned—in other words, to prepare a full list of projects that we will work on ahead of time, and accordingly, provide those projects with the necessary financing and give corresponding instructions to the departments that need to be involved. So, I feel that in this regard we not only have close, strategic, partnership relations, but also strong high-tech relations as well, because these relations are based on good planning.</p><p>In 2011 alone, we are planning to meet at least 10 times in bilateral and multilateral formats. We can, by right, be satisfied with what we achieved in 2010. First and foremost, I am referring to the Customs Union and paving the way toward the establishment of the Eurasian Economic Union. This is truly a qualitative step forward along the path to integration. This year promises to be filled with equally significant events.</p><p>HE President Nazarbayev also earned deserved recognition as a committed supporter of integration in the Eurasian region. He has been very instrumental in the successful practical implementation of projects to establish the Customs Union and the Common Economic Space. I hope that our close coordination of cooperation policy within the different regional groupings, including the CIS, CSTO, EurAsEC, and the SCO will help these organizations to continue to develop and improve in the interests of peace and stability in Eurasia.</p><p>We did not make integration our goal merely because we want to broaden our contacts or to have more international officials. Integration is a way to improve the quality of life for the citizens of our countries. The only way to build a stable foundation for future prosperity is by following along the path of integration and promoting a modern form of integration, such as in Europe. However, we still have a great deal to do, and I think here we have an opportunity to discuss what could be done and how to move forward. This is especially true since these processes have become a very stable trend over the past few years. President Nazerbayev has always been a supporter of integration, a supporter of Eurasian cooperation, and has consistently upheld this position. We have made significant progress in the past few years, and we are very pleased about that.</p><p>I want to say that we have great respect for His Excellency as our friend, a friend of the Russian Federation, and as a person who has made an enormous contribution to the development of friendly relations between the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan. We wish Kazakhstan every success. I hope everything will go well and the two of us will continue to communicate in the course of 2011, during our numerous bilateral and multilateral meetings.</p><h4></h4>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Turkey has always given importance to cooperation with Kazakhstan, with which it does not share a border but a common culture and a common geography. The root of the relationship between our peoples is found in the depths of history. Furthermore, our countries are located on two important communication lines, which pass through the north and south of the Caspian Sea, connecting the west and the east of Eurasia.</p><p>While the above-mentioned exceptional geographical location and our common values offer us vast opportunities in the political, economic, and cultural spheres, it charges us with responsibilities at the same time as well. Neither Turkey nor Kazakhstan at any time shied away from taking responsibilities. They have both played a leading role in various initiatives in this regard in international and regional organizations.</p><p>The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) chairmanship for the year 2010 is the most meaningful indicator of the level of development Kazakhstan has attained since independence. It is proof of the international community's trust in Kazakhstan that it assumed the chairmanship of the OSCE, an organization that regulates the basics of international relations and interactions today, such as comprehensive security and stability, multi-dimensional cooperation, human rights, democratic society, rule of law, and good governance.</p><div class="quote">“Looking from Turkey, the achievements of Kazakhstan, the means and capabilities of which we closely know, come as no surprise."</div><p>Looking from Turkey, the achievements of Kazakhstan, the means and capabilities of which we closely know, come as no surprise. Since its independence, Turkey and Kazakhstan have been in a continuously developing state of solidarity. Our intensive and comprehensive relations have given us the opportunity to closely understand the full potential of Kazakhstan.</p><p>The juxtaposition of historical experience, multicultural societal structure, human potential, and natural resources with a sensible and progressive government have empowered Kazakhstan with the means to become a leading nation in Central Asia and an important actor in the Eurasian geography, gaining Kazakhstan the respect of the international community.</p><p>The main determinant of the bilateral relationship between Turkey and Kazakhstan is the common values that the two brotherly nations share. Our common history, culture, roots, language, and holy values tie our nations in an unshakable way. No force can separate our countries and societies, which were fused even further by great wise men and leaders of the Turkic world, such as Hodja Ahmed Yassavi and Mustafa Kemal Atatürk.</p><p>In 2010, Turkey and Kazakhstan held the chairmanship of the most important security and cooperation organizations in Europe and Asia. I would like to emphasize the importance of two Turkic nations holding chairmanships of the OSCE and the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures in Asia (CICA) at the same time. I think that through strong solidarity Turkey and Kazakhstan can contribute to stability, peace, and development initiatives, drawing inspiration from the civilization of the Turkic world based on tolerance, humanism, and human love. I would also like to emphasize that Turkey and Kazakhstan are in active cooperation in various international organizations jointly, such as the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) and Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO).</p><p>Turkey has always given importance to the establishment of a Eurasian vision in organizations that it is a member of. It was a priority for us during our 2010 chairmanship of the Council of Europe that the Council developed cooperation with Central Asian states. The election of a Turkish MP to the presidency of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe points out that the international community shares Turkey's vision.</p><p>Turkey and Kazakhstan are located on the East-West communication corridor and have important roles to play in the development of new transportation corridors. It is crucial to manage the East-West communication corridors in the most advanced way possible in order to establish a long-lasting development order in the wide geography that we share through the development and utilization of our natural resources. Such efforts will materialize to a great extent once the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway starts operating in 2012. This way, we are going to have a fast and reliable transportation artery between Europe, the Caucasus, Central Asia, the Far East, and Southern Asia. However, we should not limit the functions of transportation corridors to the economy solely. We should consistently emphasize the strengthening of dialogue between civilizations through communication corridors. Otherwise, we will be deprived of an important means that will enable societies to better understand each other.</p><p>Turkey and Kazakhstan also approach global issues in Eurasia with the same level of sensitivity. For example, both countries are net contributors to the international initiatives in Iraq and Afghanistan, targeted to establish peace and stability. Our countries cooperate in many spheres of economy and trade, particularly in energy. With our intensive cooperation in the field of education, such as the Hodja Ahmed Yassavi University, our countries' scientific potential is at the service of the region.</p><p>Established in 2009 with the signing of the Nakhchivan Agreement, The Turkic Cooperation Council officially started its activities in 2010. Our countries have contributed greatly to the establishment of this body. Turkey and Kazakhstan are leading the development and introduction of the Turkic civilization. At the Nakhchivan Summit it was decided a Turkic Academy in Astana would be established upon President Nazarbayev's proposal. The realization of this project is one of the most prioritized projects on Turkey's and Kazakhstan's agendas.</p><p>President Nazarbayev's leadership in the cooperation mechanisms among Turkic nations will never be forgotten by the Turkic world. I would like to reiterate my appreciation of Kazakhstan's successful and sensible politics under President Nazarbayev's wise leadership following the country's independence, making Kazakhstan a respectable member of the international community and a leading country in Central Asia.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Kazakhstan has been one of the most successful CIS countries with regards to its integration into the world economy. What has Kazakhstan done differently from other countries in the region?</h4><p>Our policy of openness and stability has become one of the key factors in attracting foreign companies to Kazakhstan. Since 1993, Kazakhstan has attracted more than $125 billion. This puts Kazakhstan in first place among Central Asian countries and second among CIS countries. Our country has also taken a leading position in terms of accumulated foreign investments per capita as a result of our smart investment policy. Since gaining independence we have managed to create a sufficiently attractive investment climate. Kazakhstan has about 8,000 companies with foreign capital, including companies on the Fortune 500 list. This is a great achievement for Kazakhstan. However, it should be noted that about 74% of all FDI to Kazakhstan in 2000 to 2009 was provided by investors focused on the raw materials sector. The country has set an ambitious goal for accelerated economic diversification. The state launched a program for accelerated industrial and innovative development in 2010. It has become clear that FDI will be the main way to implement the program, which aims to diversify and strengthen the national economy. In line with this program we have developed a specialized branch program based on the attraction of investments, development of special economic zones (SEZs), and export promotion for the next five years. The first year after the state program was launched has shown that the approach of the chosen strategy was correct. This was evident from the positive trend of attracting $2.1 billion in investment into manufacturing—almost 17% higher than over 2009. Particular importance is being paid to the implementation of niche projects that involve modes of production not yet established in Kazakhstan. So far more than 80 niche projects involving the production of more than 400 kinds of products worth over $40 billion have been identified. The major component of the state program is the Industrialization Map of Kazakhstan that includes all the significant projects in the national economy. The map is a kind of information base for foreign and domestic companies, providing information on investment projects and business opportunities. The industrialization map includes 469 projects worth $56.4 billion (KZT8.3 trillion) that aim to create more than 141,000 jobs during construction and 167,000 jobs during operation.</p><h4>The Committee on Investments (CI) provides assistance in promoting the development of a favorable investment climate in the country. What strengths and prospects has the CI brought to the investment climate of Kazakhstan?</h4><p>The CI aims to create an attractive environment for direct investment into secondary sectors of the economy. The Committee has been doing a lot of work on this. In 2010, the Committee was involved in 28 events to promote Kazakhstan abroad, resulting in more than 150 bilateral cooperation agreements—most successfully with France, Germany, Belgium, Turkey, and South Korea. In 2011, the CI, together with relevant government agencies, has organized the seventh World Islamic Economic Forum (WIEF)—the first CIS country to do so—and it received a lot of attention from the Islamic financial world. The forum invited more than 20 delegations from Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) member states, with delegates from more than 40 different countries and international organizations also being represented. The outcome of all these conferences was not superficial. The agreements that were reached between Kazakhstani and foreign companies should lead to the realization of investment projects. Another important direction of the CI's work is in monitoring the implementation of investment contracts. Preferences are needed to promote investment inflows and develop priority sectors in Kazakhstan's economy. The Committee also actively cooperates with the OECD, under the “Sector Competitiveness Strategies" project. This project was initiated by the government of the Republic of Kazakhstan and the OECD. The project aims to formulate recommendations in the IT sector, in agriculture, and in the investment policy and investment promotion area.</p><h4>How do you facilitate business for foreign investors and their local partners? What modes of cooperation do you offer?</h4><p>The President created an advisory body called the Foreign Investors Council 12 years ago. At plenary sessions of the Council critical national and global economic issues are discussed and their influence on the development of Kazakhstan is assessed. These working groups discuss  Kazakhstan's image, taxation levels, legislation issues, foreign investor activity, and oil and gas development. These working groups are good platforms for investors to make recommendations and consult on various areas of activity. The Council consists of 29 world giants such as the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), Deutsche Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland, Mitsubishi International, BG Group, Chevron, Arcelor Mittal, Telia Sonera, General Electric, Metro, Finmeccanica Group, Cameco Corporation, the Asian Development Bank, Deloitte, and Ernst &amp; Young.</p><div class="quote">“The Committee on Investments aims to create an attractive environment for direct investment into secondary sectors."</div><h4>The accelerated industrial-innovative development plan is a big step in achieving economic diversification. In which export-oriented non-prime sectors do you see the biggest appetite for foreign investors?</h4><p>The program seeks to encourage growth in the secondary sector—specifically in oil refining and developing oil and gas infrastructure, a metallurgical complex, a nuclear and chemical industry, a mechanical engineering and construction industry, pharmaceuticals, agriculture, tourism, ICT, biotechnology, alternative power, and space activities. Metallurgy is one of the prime sectors because we have large supplies. Kazakhstan intends to increase this type of processing to make products with a higher value-added. It is also necessary to mention the chemical industry. The market capacity of the industry is about $3.5 billion. Imports make up about $2.2 billion, basically as it encompasses high-cost goods such as rubber and plastic, perfumes, and detergents. The market capacity of mechanical engineering in 2008 was around $13.2 billion, and the import of capital goods represented 85% of overall imports. Within the mechanical engineering sector, priority is given to agricultural machinery manufacture (such as tractors and combines), rail passenger and freight wagons, and also to the motor industry (automobile and commercial cars). Taking into account the fast rates of construction in Kazakhstan, great attention is given to the construction industry. Kazakhstan is also interested in developing its own pharmaceutical industry. Under the state program for industrial-innovative development, the share of domestic medical products by the end of 2014 should increase by up to 50% of the internal market. Today, Kazakhstani manufacturing enterprises can contractually manufacture 400 medical products.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does the transport sector play in Kazakhstan's economy?</h4><p>This year marks Kazakhstan's 20th year of independence; we are a young country. Many things were introduced to this country not so long ago, and the same is true for the logistics business. Kazakhstan has one of the lowest population density ratios in the world; however, due to its favorable geographical location, transport and logistics is expected to become a significant source of the country's earnings in the years to come. The Western Europe-Western China transit highway re-introduces the concept of the ancient Silk Road. In light of this, Kazakhstan will become a major transit player for goods produced in Southeast Asia on their way to the Russian and European markets. The recent financial turmoil has slowed the growth of this segment in Kazakhstan; however, thanks to correct and timely business decisions, DAMU Logistics has been able to survive the crisis, and now we see the potential for growth.</p><h4>What strategies were applied to dampen the effects of the global financial crisis?</h4><p>One of the strategic decisions made long before the recession started was keeping construction costs at reasonably low levels. Feeling that something was amiss beforehand, we tried hard to deliver the lowest costs possible across the industry. As a result, we managed to build our warehousing facilities three times cheaper per square meter compared to some of our peers in Kazakhstan. Generally, this allowed us to provide favorable commercial terms to our tenants when the markets turned south. As a result, even during the bottom of the crisis our occupancy ratio never fell below 50%. We are always looking to build long-term relationships with our tenants. When the crisis struck, we didn't consider ourselves a standalone player. We got together with our customers to survive the crisis, and we survived it as a team. Our mission is to free our commercial partners of the burden of dealing with logistics “in house", and so they outsource their logistics to us. We aim to reduce the logistics costs of our customers as much as possible. As our partners concentrate on the development of their businesses, they can rely on us to take care of their customs and transport operations. That is why there is such a huge amount of trust in DAMU Logistics, especially in dealing with customer solutions.</p><h4>How does DAMU seek to differentiate itself in the market from its main competitors?</h4><p>The logistics market in Kazakhstan is very clearly structured and there are relatively few players in each segment. Kazakhstan is a landlocked country, and that is why the bulk of cargo is carried by rail. For example, most of the country's mineral resources, except for the majority of oil and gas, are transported by rail. As regards the road transportation segment, it is mostly composed of individual truck owners. Customer orders are collected and handled by freight forwarding companies and intermediaries that act like booking agencies. The freight forwarding companies do not have their own fleet of trucks and cannot be considered as fully fledged logistics companies. When cargo moves from point A to point B, this is only the beginning of a long and complex process called logistics. The lion's share of work takes place at logistics terminals, including cross docking, customs clearance, storage, handling, distribution, and delivery. DAMU Logistics' business is to invest in such logistics terminals and to provide a unique combination of services, including customs, container, warehousing, and transport logistics. This creates synergies and produces a multiplier effect.</p><div class="quote">“Kazakhstan will become a major transit player for goods produced in Southeast Asia on their way to the Russian and European markets."</div><h4>Kazakhstan is a large country. How do you look to provide services over such a vast area?</h4><p>Kazakhstan inherited most of its current transport infrastructure, such as roads, rail, and airports from the Soviet Union. Once being an integral part of a centralized system, in the 1990s this infrastructure was privatized into the hands of hundreds of companies. DAMU Logistics has built a presence in three key regions of Kazakhstan: Almaty in the southeast, Astana in the north, and Aktobe in the west. Large distribution hubs in these areas will allow us to effectively cover the entire country. In addition, Kazakhstan, Belarus, and Russia formed a Customs Union in 2010. DAMU Logistics has acquired a land plot in Moscow, and from there we will have better access to the entire Customs Union and to the EU as well. On the other hand, we also have land at Khorgos on the Kazakhstani-Chinese border, from where we can serve the Chinese market. By doing this we are building a land bridge between the EU and Southeast Asia.</p><h4>Who are your clients and what products do you work with the most?</h4><p>Each market, whether be it FMCG, beauty products, pharmaceuticals, or clothing, has its own major players. We are proud to say that our customer portfolio includes major players from each of those sectors. Back in 2005, Procter &amp; Gamble became our first large-scale customer. It wasn't just our client, but also a mentor. Thanks to P&amp;G we have adopted the latest technologies.</p><h4>How does this logistics network complement the idea of industrial parks?</h4><p>The history of our company goes back to 2004, when we built our first logistics terminal. Based on its success we built our first industrial and logistics park in 2008. The concept of combining an industrial and logistics park does not exist—even in Russia. However, we can find similar models in Finland, China, Vietnam, and Singapore. There are advantages of working with DAMU for local and foreign companies, particularly when they plan to enter Kazakhstan.</p><p>When you look at our customer portfolio, you will find that some of our clients need customs clearance, transportation, and warehousing services. Others like Scania established their first truck-service center in Central Asia. Danone, for example, completed the construction of its dairy products plant in just six months. This was only partly due to fast construction; we facilitated the entire process, especially on the bureaucratic side.</p><h4>What future do you see for DAMU's industrial and logistics parks?</h4><p>In a newly built economy, every new project will be in demand. However, the introduction of our first industrial and logistics park was a timely decision, and when we entered the market with our services the idea was well received. The concept of DAMU is originally older than the government's industrialization program. However, once this program was launched, DAMU automatically became a part of it since the authorities aim to promote and support the manufacturing and services sectors in Kazakhstan. I spent time studying industrial and logistic parks in a number of countries. For example, Hungary built some 170 industrial parks and I believe Kazakhstan will need 170 of such parks, too.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-advantage-of-membership]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Serving its 153 Members, the World Trade Organization (WTO) today is celebrated as one of the great successes of international economic cooperation. As an organization that maintains the multilateral trading system, it essentially has five core functions to provide: (i) a set of rules for the conduct of international trade; (ii) monitoring and surveillance of trade policy measures; (iii) a forum for negotiating trade liberalization; (iv) a dispute settlement system and (v) technical assistance and capacity building.<br></p><p>By its very nature, the multilateral trading system aspires to be universal. Article XII of the Marrakesh Agreement that established the WTO stipulates that countries may accede to the WTO on specific terms to be negotiated between the WTO Members and applicants.</p><p>The process of accession involves negotiations between Members and the applicant government for which purpose a special Working Party is set up. In the Working Party, the applicant presents a memorandum of its foreign trade regime and on proposed changes to implement the WTO commitments. They also answer questions from WTO Members.</p><div class="quote">“The outcome of the accession negotiations is contained in a protocol of accession, which includes all the commitments by the acceding country to abide by WTO rules."</div><p>The outcome of the accession negotiations is contained in a protocol of accession, which includes all the commitments by the acceding country to abide by WTO rules, a schedule with the bindings on tariff and agricultural domestic support, as well as specific commitments on services. Once the protocol of accession is approved by consensus in the Working Party, it is followed by the approval of the WTO Members in the General Council and ratified by the applicant thereafter.</p><p>The accession negotiations involve two main aspects. First, a bilateral market access negotiation on merchandise and services between the acceding country and all interested WTO Members individually. The results remain confidential until all negotiations on market access are concluded, at which point the results are consolidated in one schedule circulated to all Members. The most-favored nation obligation applies, and consequently the benefits of these negotiations are extended to all Members of the WTO.</p><p>Second, in accordance with Article XVI of the Agreement establishing the WTO, “each member shall ensure that their laws, regulations, and administrative decisions are in line with the commitments arising from the attached agreements". Therefore, among other things, accession to the WTO requires a transposition of international commitments into the domestic laws of the acceding country and will have a major effect on the country's legal framework. While these changes may be profound and may seem radical to some, they are in fact enhancing the transparency and credibility of government economic and other trade-related policies and will help create a more secure business environment. Hence, implementation of the WTO agreements plays a role in assisting governments striving to attain important political and economic objectives. This is not a “real" negotiation, since the Members will want the relevant regulatory framework to be in full compliance with WTO obligations before accession. For many to undertake the necessary reforms is a long and, at times, painful process. And usually, the speed of domestic reform is what dictates the speed of the accession.</p><p>Kazakhstan is a party to the Customs Union with Russia and Belarus, which came into existence on January 1, 2010. The announcement of the formation of the Customs Union brought much confusion and slowed down the accession negotiations of its three members, as it took considerable time to fully ascertain the impact of this new bloc on the terms of their accession to the WTO.</p><p>In light of Article XXIV:4-8 of GATT 1994 and Article V of GATS, the WTO recognizes that regional trade agreements (RTAs), i.e. customs unions and free trade agreements, and the WTO share the common objective of trade liberalization, and thus allows their existence as an exception to the most-favored nation principle. Under a customs union, several aspects of trade policy, for example customs administration and tariffs, are common to its signatories vis-í -vis the rest of the world. Once their compatibility with the WTO is ascertained, the accession negotiations of all three Customs Union members should be facilitated.</p><p>For the Republic of Kazakhstan, a state that gained independence in 1991, the advantages of accession are plenty. To begin with, accession to the WTO will significantly improve the existing conditions for the country's access to foreign commodity markets and provide non-discriminatory treatment for Kazakhstani exporters to the markets of the WTO's 153 Members. Being the ninth largest country in the world, Kazakhstan has a relatively small domestic market and will benefit from improved terms of access to the expanding global market. Secondly, as a Member of the WTO, Kazakhstan will gain recourse to the WTO dispute settlement system and thus better protect its interests. Thirdly, keeping in mind non-negotiating aspects of the accession process, the membership will further enhance and liberalize the climate for foreign investments in the country, which, in turn, will expand opportunities for trade of goods and services to and from Kazakhstan. Fourthly, the increased flows of foreign goods, services, and investments to the Kazakhstani market will stimulate domestic producers to enhance the quality of their produce and build up their competitiveness. Finally, as a WTO Member, Kazakhstan will participate in negotiations on future international trade agreements and fully join the international cooperation efforts of rule making in the area of trade and intellectual property.</p><p>Considerable progress has been made in the negotiations, and the WTO Members look forward to welcoming Kazakhstan as a Member in the near future.</p><p>This article was prepared with the assistance of Nadiya Nychay, Attorney-at-Law, former contract lawyer with the WTO.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Amply endowed with natural resources, but handicapped by its landlocked situation, Central Asia has experienced unparalleled rates of growth over the past 10 years. The exploitation of these resources and the investments that have been made, often with the help of foreign capital, provide the basis for this paradigm of growth and productivity. However, many challenges including economic diversification and private sector development hamper future growth prospects.<br></p><h4>Abundant natural resources</h4><p>The existence of oil deposits is a major factor in the distribution of wealth among the Central Asian republics. While on the one hand countries such as Kazakhstan or Turkmenistan, and to a lesser extent Uzbekistan, have major reserves of fossil fuels, on the other hand Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan have no oil and gas reserves at all. This difference can be seen in national economic indicators. In 2009, Kazakhstan's GDI per capita (in purchasing power parity) was more than $10,000, that is to say five times greater than that of Kyrgyzstan or Tajikistan. Besides oil and gas deposits in the Caspian Sea, Central Asia also has abundant natural resources. Gold deposits in Kyrgyzstan account for 15% of that country's GDP; Tajikistan has significant hydro-electric potential; and Uzbekistan is one of the world's leading exporters of cotton, while its gold deposits could potentially make it a major gold-exporting country. Kazakhstan, for its part, is richly endowed with natural resources: a major exporter of wheat and flour, the country also has large deposits of precious metals such as chromium, zinc, lead, and uranium.</p><div class="quote">“A major exporter of wheat and flour, the country also has large deposits of precious metals such as chromium, zinc, lead, and uranium."</div><p>What these countries have in common is their geographical location, which is both a disadvantage and at the same time a source of opportunities. It is firstly a disadvantage in the fact that the region is landlocked, has a low population density, and a difficult climate, and these tend to increase the transaction costs associated with trade, such as the costs of crossing borders (time spent in customs, possible corruption, the unpredictability of delivery dates, etc.), transport, and storage. It is secondly a source of opportunities in that Central Asia lies mid-way between Asia and Europe and could therefore serve as a transit zone and logistics platform for trade between the two continents. Overcoming the problems arising from being landlocked is key to the future success of the region. The creation of transnational transport infrastructure and the elimination of red tape at border crossings within the region call for close cooperation between the countries in the region—cooperation, which in the light of the present situation, could be improved.</p><h4>Diversifying FDI flows</h4><p>Since 2000, Kazakhstan has enjoyed average annual growth rates above 8%, thereby ranking it among the 10 best performing economies in the world. To date, this strong economic performance has largely been driven by the natural resources sector.</p><p>Kazakhstan alone attracts more FDI than all the other Central Asian countries combined. In 2009, foreign funding amounted to 8.2% of Kazakhstan's GDP, with FDI flows accounting for over 140% of the total, which offset major outflows of capital in the form of bank loans. Again in 2009, 70% of all FDI flows to Kazakhstan were destined for oil and gas exploration and development, that is to say twice the level reported in the mid-1990s. In the same year, around 70% of FDI was still being provided by OECD member countries, with major investments by the US, the UK, Italy, France, and the Netherlands (the traditional headquarters of the major oil companies).</p><p>To improve the competitiveness of the non-energy sectors and attract foreign investors to the latter, Kazakhstan must overcome two obstacles. Firstly, OECD member countries have invested significantly less abroad since the beginning of the economic crisis in the second half of 2008. Secondly, OECD countries are themselves the main recipients of foreign investment, given that in 2009 they still accounted for almost 68% of all FDI flows. Kazakhstan is also competing against other high-growth emerging economies such as Russia, India, or China for the remainder, i.e. 32%, of global FDI flows.</p><p>Kazakhstan can count several obvious competitive advantages to help it meet these challenges. Labor costs in the service sector are half those in countries currently attracting a new wave of investment, such as Poland or Hungary, and slightly lower than labor costs in Russia.</p><p>In the agricultural sector, the countries can count on their vast prairies for cattle rearing and on vast expanses of arable land for crops. Kazakhstan, for example, has almost 24.5 million hectares of arable land—the 14th largest area of arable land in the world. At present, up to 3.5 million hectares of arable land—i.e. around 15% of the total arable land in the country—are not cultivated. Opportunities exist. Let's look at the wheat sector, for example. The excellent agro-climatic conditions are highly conducive to growing very high-quality spring wheat.</p><p>Kazakhstan's low production costs (which are, for example, half those of France for wheat, and approximately 60% of those for Ukraine and Russia) put this country in a good position to compete in international markets, particularly in view of the fact that the country can profit from its geographical location, with low shipping costs to Middle Eastern countries (which are massive wheat importers) and to the EU two or three times lower than those of other major exporters of cereals such as Australia or the US.</p><p>Several priority sectors for FDI could be targeted such as the agri-food sector (in particular wheat, beef, and dairy products), the chemical fertilizer sector, and the logistics for the latter, as well as the IT and other business services sector (ICT, consultancies, and so on). These sectors are both attractive (which includes, for example, market growth potential) and beneficial for the country (for example, through transfers of knowledge and technologies).</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>The seventh World Islamic Economic Forum (WIEF) was held in Astana, Kazakhstan in June 2011. Once again, it was a platform for discussions on SMEs, the empowerment of women, the encouragement of entrepreneurship among the youth, and an ever-increasing focus on Islamic banking. These days, it seems like everybody wants to become involved in Islamic banking. Every major city wants to be an Islamic banking center. London wants to be a center, as does Tokyo, Singapore, and Hong Kong. The Islamic banking and financial services industry, with participation from conventional players, is now competing to service the global community. And the urge has been so strong and spontaneous that no one has had to push hard for Islamic banking and finance to be accepted.<br></p><p>The whole world has been looking for a system to cope with problems related to the experiences gained from the recent financial crisis. Islamic banking, which embodies the universal principles of ethical finance and socially responsible investment, has built-in mechanisms to protect itself from extreme shocks. Because of aspects such as this one, the methodology of Islamic banking is fast becoming more acceptable, even beyond the shores of the Muslim world, with people increasingly buying into the idea of “finance with a moral compass" as the new name of the game.</p><p>Indeed, although it may be the answer to shock-resistant banking, a proper framework governing all aspects of the sector needs to be established immediately. There is, additionally, an urgent need for standardization of the product brand of the Islamic finance industry. In understanding rules and regulations and compliance, one cannot afford to be vague. This requires an appropriate regulatory framework and an infrastructure and architecture that promote Islamic capital markets. Islamic finance and banking must be put in place systematically, with the involvement of all stakeholders. Sure, there is profit to be made with Islamic finance, and Islamic bankers are no angels in disguise. However, they are still imbued with a discipline that is less averse to risks, they conduct more due diligence, and they are more wary. In other words, they practice safe banking.</p><div class="quote">“Islamic finance and banking must be put in place systematically, with the involvement of all stakeholders."</div><p>The time is right for this. We see positive trends prevailing for the development of Islamic banking. In some countries, growth is as much as 10%-15% annually. This is indeed most encouraging, and deserves full government support within the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) countries. Malaysia has spent 30 years developing Islamic finance to successfully function in parallel with the conventional banking system. It is clear that Islamic finance can co-exist and thrive alongside the conventional banking system, and it should be promoted much more with unity of purpose and consensus.</p><p>In the six previous forums we have gone beyond talk, and tried to make sense of the dialogue and come out with defined areas for action. Throughout the year, and before the forum in Astana, the WIEF conducted roundtable discussions on the future of Islamic finance and the halal market in Bahrain and Turkey, bringing together international bankers in conventional and Islamic finance sectors, budding and established entrepreneurs, and halal industry practitioners to talk about furthering practical applications of sharia-compliant financing schemes and harmonizing the halal market to consolidate the strengths of the different economies of the Muslim World. Furthermore, in preparation for the forum in Astana, the WIEF Businesswomen Network (WBN) conducted its second workshop in January 2011, with 28 female entrepreneurs in attendance from 14 different countries. Furthermore, in February 2011 the WIEF Young Leaders Network (WYN) met with the Young Association of Muslim Professionals in Singapore and Malaysia for the first time. It was ideas from these forums that the discussions in Astana in June 2011 were based upon.</p><p>WIEF chose Kazakhstan because it really is an undiscovered gem. It has real potential to make positive change in the Islamic world. It is a country of 16 million people with enough arable land to feed half a billion. Its proven oil and gas reserves will make it the 10th largest producer by 2015, and it is also rich in minerals such as uranium. We were extremely pleased to host the forum in Astana, and bring the focus to Central Asia as Kazakhstan looks to provide both energy and food security to Central Asia and the Asia Pacific region.</p><p>While there is an important need for the governments of Islamic countries to involve themselves in the WIEF framework to seek business and economic solutions, it is the private sector as represented by the business people who are the most active players in the annual forums. These are the people who will be driving the aims and aspirations of the WIEF in the following years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>It has been some 17 years since the so-called “Deal of the Century" was signed between BP and Azerbaijan. What level of investment has gone into making the Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli (ACG) field such a success?<br></h4><p>The ACG field is a fantastic asset that has hugely contributed to the country's national development turning Azerbaijan into the leading country in the region and supporting regional stability and economic development. We at BP are proud to be the operator of this world-class field that has made us a significant part of Azerbaijan's independent history. To date a total of over $24 billion of investment has been made in the development of the ACG field. In addition, a further $6 billion in investment was committed by the project's shareholders in 2010 through the new Chirag Oil Project. These numbers are huge by all standards.</p><p>If we add to these figures the $10 billion of revenues the project delivers to Azerbaijan every year, the billions of cubic meters of free associated gas, the new facilities built on the most up-to-date design and technology, one of the largest oil and gas storage and processing terminals in the world, a sophisticated web of subsea pipelines, existing facilities refurbished and upgraded to world standards, and tens of thousands of new job opportunities, then the overall benefits from ACG to the country and the region will rise to a huge and extremely impressive scale.</p><div class="quote">“We have seen the continued support and goodwill of the government, SOCAR, and the people of Azerbaijan."</div><p>The ACG contract has also meant tens of millions of dollars of investment in social development projects, including educational programs, building skills, and capabilities in local communities, improving access to social infrastructure in communities, supporting local enterprises through the provision of access to finance and training as well as technical assistance to public institutions. Clearly, ACG's overall impact on the country's economic development has been massive.</p><h4>What is the current level of production from this field, and what sort of production life do you see the field potentially having?</h4><p>The field is currently producing about 800,000 barrels a day from five production platforms. We are currently building a sixth production platform expected to start up in 2013. From the start of production in November 1997 until the end of May 2011 about 1.8 billion barrels of oil were produced at ACG. To date we have sent over 1,540 tanker loads of ACG crude to world markets via the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline, which is another world-class project that has enabled Azerbaijan to re-establish its name in the oil history of the world. The total estimated oil production volumes from ACG are expected to be over 5 billion barrels—a huge field that ranks very high in the global industry, and I believe with further investments and the application of new technologies it will continue to hold one of the top-ranking positions among the world's high-quality fields for more than a decade.</p><h4>What sort of a working relationship has BP had with the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan (SOCAR), and in what areas is it seeking to develop this relationship further?</h4><p>We are very proud of our record of partnership in Azerbaijan. Since day one of our presence in this country we have seen the continued support and goodwill of the government, SOCAR, and the people of Azerbaijan. This partnership has been at the heart of all the projects we have led—the ACG, BTC, and Shah Deniz developments. This has been a true partnership the success of which has been a key driver of Azerbaijan's rapid economic development over the past 17 years. This partnership has been a driving force in turning the nation's vision into a reality, and today's reality is that Azerbaijan enjoys unparalleled economic growth and prosperity, and strong and irreversible independence. It is a regional leader and is strongly linked with its neighbors and the rest of the world. This partnership has generated tens of billions of dollars in revenues and will continue to generate massive revenues for many years to come. BP has a long-term commitment to this partnership and we look forward to new joint projects and initiatives both under the already concluded exploration deals and in new opportunities. BP has proven to be Azerbaijan's reliable partner, offering its international expertise and standards, technologies and processes, and creating opportunities to combine these with Azerbaijan's outstanding experience and knowledge of the Caspian Basin. This combination has to date yielded very good results benefiting all of the parties involved.</p><h4>How significant is Azerbaijan to BP's global operations?</h4><p>Well, firstly, I would like to highlight that our activities in Azerbaijan form a very important part of BP's global business. In Azerbaijan we are the operator of two major upstream projects, three export pipelines, and two exploration projects. Our activities here also extend to Georgia and Turkey. ACG, with its multi-billion-barrel estimated volumes, is one of the largest reservoirs in BP's portfolio. The planned Shah Deniz full-field development is the largest gas development project operated by BP in the world. This project is expected to export gas to the European Union through a new southern corridor that will for the first time link the region with Europe. We regard our new deal with Azerbaijan—the joint exploration and development of the Shafag-Asiman offshore block in the Caspian Sea—as an exciting opportunity that inspires hopes that, in addition to the existing opportunities, Azerbaijan can become a future growth area in BP's global business. As a native Azeri, I am really proud that the business I lead in this region ranks at the top of BP's global business based on the quality of the projects, the benefits it delivers to all parties, and the opportunities it offers for long-term successful partnership in the region.</p><h4>How successful has the Shah Deniz field been in production terms? What can we expect from Stage 2 of the project?</h4><p>Shah Deniz is a huge gas field that BP and SOCAR discovered in the Azeri sector of the Caspian Sea in May 1999. With over 1 trillion cubic meters of gas in place, it is one of the world's giant gas fields. Production from the field started in 2006—just seven years after discovery. Since that time the field has been delivering gas to the markets of Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey within the first stage of development, which can produce approximately 9 billion cubic meters of gas per year and about 50,000 barrels of condensate per day. The success of Stage 1 has been key to developing the next stage of Shah Deniz, which we call full-field development, and is one of the largest gas developments in the world and will provide a further 16 billion cubic meters of gas to the markets of Europe, with the first gas scheduled for 2017. The Shah Deniz full-field development project will include two new bridge-linked production platforms, 26 subsea wells to be drilled with two semi-submersible rigs, and 500 kilometers of subsea pipelines in water depths of up to 550 meters. SOCAR and the Shah Deniz partners have signed a five-year extension to the Shah Deniz Production Sharing Agreement (PSA). The Shah Deniz export transit organization has been established in Ankara to work with Turkey's BOTAíž and the main prospective EU pipeline groups including Interconnector Turkey-Greece-Italy Poseidon (ITGI), Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP), and Nabucco. The Shah Deniz consortium has requested a firm conditional tariff by October 1, 2011 from all the pipeline groups to enable the selection to be made in the fourth quarter of 2011.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2011</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the background to the Azinko Holding story? How did the company emerge as a major player on the Azerbaijani construction scene?<br></h4><p>Practical works on establishing and developing construction companies with highly trained professional staff that are competitive and competent to manufacture products based on advanced scientific and high-tech achievements were founded by the National Leader Heydar Aliyev and are successfully being pursued by the respected President Ilham Aliyev. As a result of technical education and training programs initiated by the government after independence, private companies were quickly established. Azinko Holding started its activity in 2006 and includes eight independent companies active mainly in the construction field. It is no accident that Azinko Holding was presented with the “Ughur" (success) award for contributing to the revival of unique colors and national traditions in 2007 and 2008, and the Caspian Energy Award for its architectural approach to city building in 2009.</p><h4>What are some of the major construction projects your company has been involved with in the Baku area, and what are some of your core urban development strategies?</h4><p>Azinko Holding deals with the construction and reconstruction of hotels, multi-story buildings and residences, complexes, short-term resort houses, and business centers, as well as facilities and auxiliary units, project estimates, and technological and design works. We also produce construction materials such as cement and concrete, among others. Currently, Azinko Holding has nearly finished building multi-story residential buildings with a total living area of 400,000 sqm in 11 locations around Baku and in various locations across the Republic of Azerbaijan. We completed the Dalga Plaza Business Center, a high-class office complex built to international standards, in 2010.</p><div class="quote">“Azinko Holding is successful because of its commitment to modern and international construction norms."</div><h4>How do the five core subsidiaries in Azinko Holding create synergies when bidding for and completing construction projects?</h4><p>Azinko Holding is successful because of its commitment to modern and international construction norms, while following rich and ancient architectural and city-building traditions. In addition, we benefit from the experience of leading global construction companies, as well as a high level of organization, and professional and highly qualified staff with a rapid management system based on strict discipline. One of Azinko Holding's priorities is to forge long-term relationships with well-known, leading businessmen as well as to strengthen and deepen existing relationships. Our advanced management system enables us to work together efficiently and reliably.</p><h4>Have you collaborated with foreign companies on luxury hotel projects?</h4><p>I would like to highlight just one of our projects. Hotel Bilgah is being constructed on the coast on about 10 hectares of land east of the Absheron peninsula. The luxury hotel complex includes 14 two-story cottages. The hotel building is a modern architectural example of a 17-story cascade building. It will contain 176 ordinary, semi-luxury, luxury, and apartment suites as well as a cinema and concert hall, main dining hall, restaurant, discotheques, open café, banquet room, swimming pool, fitness center, sauna, Turkish hamam, and spa. With a total area of 1,300 sqm, the contract was signed with UAE-based company Jumeirah—one of the world's most well-known tourism and hotel companies implementing design and interior works and staff training.</p><h4>The construction materials sector has been trying to keep up with demand as Azerbaijan develops. How has your company sought to solve shortages in the construction materials market?</h4><p>This issue was targeted in our strategic plans. That's why we organized the production of construction materials, including cement, concrete, and white stone coverings at our plants almost since the date of Azinko's establishment. In addition, we follow long-term cooperation principles in our economic relations. This allows us to be recognized as a reliable partner, as well as serving as a mainstay for the provision and supply of construction materials not produced by our company via other companies on time and in the amounts required.</p><h4>The Baku White City project is seen as marking the next wave of construction activity in the city. Is Azinko Holding looking to take part in the project?</h4><p>As one of the flagships of Azerbaijan's construction sector, our company considers that one of its major missions is to be involved in any major project in Baku city and right around the country. Therefore, we plan to actively take part in the White City project.</p><h4>What strategies did Azinko Holding use to cope with the slowdown in construction activity during the global financial crisis? Are we beginning to see a return to growth for construction activity in Azerbaijan now?</h4><p>In order to defend its leading position in the construction market, our company always endeavors to execute both social and individual projects equally. This was achieved as a result of following market proposals, as well as reacting to changes on time and by making timely economic analysis. Thereafter, Azinko Holding will do its best to continue its work in the construction of modern buildings, as well as on refurbishment and reconstruction, currently conducted in our republic under the leadership of our distinguished President Ilham Aliyev, who has carried forward the economic progress achieved by the National Leader Heydar Aliyev.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2011</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How can you assess the position of Azerbaijan as a regional and international economic and political power over the long term?<br></h4><p>We are very optimistic about the future. After 1993, Azerbaijan became a fully independent, self-reliant, and modern country with a sustainable economy and a national and civil unity that has stepped firmly toward democracy and is integrating successfully into the international community as well as acting as a leader in the South Caucasus region. In the years to come, we are resolved to make further achievements and participate more actively in regional and world politics in order to foster mutual cooperation, confidence, security, peace, and prosperity. Relying upon the successes and potential opportunities gained so far, I can say that Azerbaijan has a very brilliant future ahead of it, and we will use all possible means to reach this target.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the potential of ICT to act as a driving force for economic development in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>In the contemporary period, ICT is very popular in all fields of life, and has become an integral part of public and economic processes. ICT is regarded as the most promising segment of the Azerbaijani economy. The National Strategy on Information and Communication Technologies for 2003-2012 and the First State Program for 2005-2008 were adopted in Azerbaijan in 2003. During this period, we created a free and competitive environment in the ICT market, attracted investments to this field, developed a legislative basis, modernized telecommunications infrastructure, and started to widely use the latest in technology. At present, the development pace of the ICT sector in the country surpasses general world indicators by several times. The report on the Global Development of Information Technologies for 2008-2009 prepared by the World Economic Forum indicates that Azerbaijan is moving ahead of several leading countries in its development of ICT and holds the leading position among CIS states. Today, Azerbaijan has become the region's ICT hub, and the possibilities of the internet are expanding rapidly. According to the latest statistical data, the national internet penetration rate is 50%. If, several years ago, one computer was available for every 1,000 people in Azerbaijan, today the proportion goes to one computer per 15 persons. Azerbaijan is also becoming a country with a space industry. Azerbaijan's first telecommunications satellite will be launched in 2012. Taking into account the geographical location of Azerbaijan and the development level of our national economy, we think that we have all the opportunities for the ICT sector to become the second most profitable field after the oil and gas sector in the near future.</p><div class="quote">“After 1993, Azerbaijan became a fully independent, self-reliant, and modern country with a sustainable economy"</div><h4>Your Excellency declared 2011 as the “Year of Tourism". What does your country intend to obtain by paying so much attention to its tourism potential?</h4><p>In general, we have the intention to fully develop all promising fields of life in Azerbaijan. Our country has quite a large and attractive tourism potential. On the one hand, Azerbaijan has nine climatic zones, beautiful and picturesque nature, rich flora and fauna, cultural heritage, and historical monuments. On the other hand, the large-scale measures undertaken in recent years to ensure rapid social and economic development have renovated all fields of public life and created an infrastructure of services, transport, communications, and public utilities that make for favorable conditions to make tourism become an economic priority. The State Program on the Development of Tourism for 2010-2014 is being implemented in Azerbaijan. Our main objective is to bring the national tourism sector in line with world standards by 2014. In the light of all these tasks, 2011 was declared the “Year of Tourism" in Azerbaijan.</p><p>Modern hotels are being opened in large cities of the country to receive foreign guests. The system of tourism services is forming rapidly in all the regions. Almost 100 hotels were operational in 2003. However, their numbers exceeded 500 in 2010. For the time being, the construction of 35 new hotels is underway. By the end of 2011, six five-star hotels will be commissioned. The world-class Shahdag Winter-Summer Tourism Complex is of particular importance, being among the largest projects in the field of tourism. Of course, the state allocates substantial funds to help shape the modern tourism infrastructure. However, the hotels are constructed by the private sector. This means that there is much confidence in the development of Azerbaijan, which makes it possible to spend hundreds of millions in this economic field. Investors have confidence that these investments will make good returns.</p><p>Azerbaijan won the Eurovision Song Contest in 2011 and obtained the right to host this event in 2012. In 2012, we expect a large number of tourists to come, and therefore we have already started to undertake the relevant measures to create convenient conditions to stage this event as well as to accommodate the guests that will arrive and ensure their safety. There is no doubt that we will fulfill all our obligations entirely in appropriately organizing this major event.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2011</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[foot-on-the-ladder]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the core reasons that led Expressbank bank to launch a rebranding exercise, and how has the institution positioned itself in the market since then?</h4><p>Azernegliyyatbank, the old name of the bank, was established in 1989 as a commercial bank by various institutions belonging to the Ministry of Transport. Since then the ownership structure of the bank has changed significantly, resulting in the full privatization of the bank by 2005 and its transformation into an open joint-stock company. Azernegliyyatbank was one of the leading local banks in the early 1990s, providing, at that time, a wide range of banking services and products to its clients. The bank, however, lost its market share over that decade and rolled down to the bottom position in the ranking of local banks. The major reasons for this were the strengthening of market competition, stricter control measures, and increased minimum capital requirements set by the Central Bank of Azerbaijan (CBAR). Following several years of regress, the majority shareholders decided to sell their stakes out at the beginning of 2008. The transaction was completed in October 2008. During 2009 the bank underwent considerable reforms, including a change of organizational structure and composition of the supervisory and management board. The new management is currently concentrated on new medium-term strategic planning, HR issues, the development of new banking products, including plastic cards, swift money transfers, and so on, improving internal procedures, and upgrading IT systems &amp; technological development. At the beginning of 2009, even in accordance with local standards, we were a tiny bank with only 50 employees, four operating branches, and nearly AZN14 million in a credit portfolio. Since then the bank has increased the number of employees to 220, and launched 11 branches all over Azerbaijan. At the same time, from scratch, we formed plastic card practices, and 50 ATMs have also been installed and more than 30,000 cards have been issued.</p><h4>The bank finished 2010 increasing its assets and liabilities, as well as its capital by 4.7%. How was 2011 for the institution?</h4><p>It was a very positive year for us as we succeeded to not only improve our financial position, but implement the major strategic tasks that were on the agenda. As to financial indicators, the bank has boosted its credit portfolio by AZN35 million, reaching AZN81 million as of end-2011. Net profit for the year exceeded AZN11 million, up from AZN6.3 million in 2010. With an additional capital injection of AZN10 million in 2011, Expressbank brought the amount of paid-capital to AZN66 million, while total equity exceeded AZN77 million. With this the bank has put its name on the list of the best capitalized banks in Azerbaijan.</p><div class="quote">“It was a very positive year for us as we succeeded to...  improve our financial position"</div><h4>What is Expressbank targeting in terms of loans for its clients for 2012?</h4><p>In 2008 we started as a corporate bank serving several large state and private entities. This certainly provided us with start-up momentum. The bank can still be considered as a corporate one, although the management is very much focused on the diversification of its customer base in general, and on increasing its retail clientele in particular. According to our medium-term business strategy, we aim for 50% retail clients and 50% corporate clients. The main targets for 2012 are to continue regional expansion, and see our credit portfolio increase by 30%, share capital reach AZN90 million, and net profits exceed AZN15 million.</p><h4>How has Expressbank elaborated its risk management policies, and how have they evolved over the years?</h4><p>CBAR is doing a good job in terms of pushing the banks toward strengthening their risk management practices. Nevertheless, there are a lot of things yet to be done in this area. One of the main challenges is that historically the banks in Azerbaijan were focused on credit risks only. So, with operations expanding quickly in all directions, it's one of our priorities to improve all related risk management procedures and ensure those are practically operative. In order to add momentum to the process, we decided to additionally secure a controlling function through the application of cross-checking actions, whereby risks are simultaneously cross-monitored by several respective sub-divisions of the bank. So far that has brought us very positive results.</p><h4>Since Expressbank recently received the MChip cards and ATM MChip certification from MasterCard, how are you looking to increase the penetration and usage of credit cards among your customers?</h4><p>We started with Visa two years ago, and now we have done so with MasterCard. It is a quite hard segment in the sector, but we are seeing constant development, something which is very positive. Expressbank sees major potential in this segment, but one that is always linked to the retail side of our operations. The development of both retail banking and plastic cards will go hand in hand in the future. During 2012 our institution will develop important plans in this regard, such as the creation of our own processing center.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[back-to-the-future]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the first nine months of your tenure at Bakcell been?</h4><p>It has been a very active period. The market has gone through some significant changes. As I joined there was a switch in the market from a “kontor" [unit] system to a manat-based credit system of payment, which was a seismic shift that saw prices drop quite considerably. Our main competitor dropped its prices very significantly, which put a lot of pressure on the market, but overall, we have performed very strongly in 2011; the number of subscribers is up, revenues are up, and our profit margins are very healthy. All in all, I am very pleased with the performance. We recently launched 3G and it has been very successful. We had over half a million customers within three days, which we were extremely pleased about, and it shows the real potential for mobile data services here in Azerbaijan. We think there is significant pent-up demand, and Bakcell is well positioned to meet it. The response we have seen from our customers proves that they also believe we hold a strong position in the market. We think our users are probably the largest body of true mobile internet users in Azerbaijan at the moment, which is a great achievement.</p><h4>What does 3G technology unlock for the future of the sector?</h4><p>We analyzed traffic over the first few days and weeks after launching the technology and found that around 60% of customers were using 3G to surf the internet and use applications, such as Facebook and YouTube. Fortunately, we have not been bitten by data-intensive downloads and we are really pleased that customers are using the terminals for what they are there for, which is exploring the internet, using internet-based services, and checking email. The overall experience seems to be that customers are getting fast internet access from Bakcell and are utilizing these services.</p><h4>Is Bakcell eyeing 4G?</h4><p>At the last BakuTel conference we demonstrated commercial 4G in a full pre-commercial deployment. A Long Term Evolution (LTE) system has been deployed on our network. We have an existing spectrum, which we can mutualize, and we strongly believe that there is a potential market here. However, we want to grow the 3G-user market first, because it represents a very significant investment. It is important to build up this market and increase 3G awareness before making the move into fast remote-complex technology. At BakuTel we were able to achieve download speeds in excess of 100 megabytes per second, and we demonstrated full-HD TV streaming over mobile internet using LTE technology. We see important potential and opportunities in services like video on demand and catch-up TV rather than mobile TV. However, looking at European markets it seems as though the revenue potential for cell phones is not so significant. In that regard, tablet computers are where the greatest opportunities are for the future.</p><div class="quote">“We think our users are probably the largest body of true mobile internet users in Azerbaijan."</div><h4>What are your expectations for mobile number portability (MNP)?</h4><p>I think number portability is definitely of benefit to the market. We are very committed to the introduction of MNP. It's been shown in other markets to increase customer choice, which is always a good thing. For us, we see a significant opportunity to attack the corporate segment and also the national business segment. Bakcell's revenues and profits mostly come from the consumer market, but we see opportunities to move into the big international corporates and also big national businesses operating in Azerbaijan, which for one reason or another generally have accounts with our competitors. We think the credibility we have built up in the consumer market puts us in a very good position to move into those segments.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the sector for 2012?</h4><p>We believe 2012 will be the year when data technology takes off. The increasing availability of smartphones as well as the availability of terminals are driving market behavior in Azerbaijan. Thanks to second-hand phones coming from the European market, prices are also decreasing. The more smartphones there are, the more internet users there will be. That is also one of the reasons why Bakcell is investing heavily in 3G.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[gold-rush]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Anglo-Asian Mining closed 2010 beating its production forecasts. How has 2011 been for the company?</h4><p>We had a very productive and successful year in 2010. We produced over 67,000 ounces of gold. In 2011 our production output was around 60,000 ounces because we were affected by very severe weather conditions in Gedabek, which is a surface mine. Apart from that, the characteristics of the mine are very exceptional and unique because of the close combination of copper and gold together. Basically, Gedabek is a copper mine with lots of gold in it. The separation of these two elements is a real challenge. Gedabek is the only mining property in the world that has two plants: SART and ADR. The former plant is being showcased as the best way to separate both elements, and I know now there are plans to construct two similar plants in Canada and Vietnam. Our company has started the process of building a new agitation leaching plant, with an investment of around $60 million, and we very much hope to see the plant operational by the end of 2012. It will allow us to extend the life of the mine and improve the recovery rate for gold and other materials. We are planning to have two production lines for sulfate ore and high-grade ore. The average recovery rate from an agitation plant should be 90%.</p><h4>With production expected from the Gosha mine by the end of 2012, what level of impact are you expecting from these operations in the future?</h4><p>In 2011 we discovered and submitted the notes of discovery to the government for another of our properties, the Gosha mine. It is located in one of the most beautiful areas in the world, at the top of a mountain. However, this makes our job difficult. We estimate that there are 300,000 ounces in just one zone of the 13 the site has. These other areas are currently being explored, as we are talking about an underground mine. We are planning to put into operation a small processing plant to produce somewhere between 15,000 and 20,000 ounces of concentrated gold annually. Later on we will decide whether to sell the gold concentrate itself or bring it back together and put it in the agitation plant. Adding Gosha's production to our overall operations, we will go over 100,000 ounces a year, which will enable us to upgrade the status of the company from a junior mining company to a mid-size mining company.</p><div class="quote">“One of the most difficult mining sites in the world is almost totally run by Azerbaijani workers."</div><h4>What is the status of the Ordubad project?</h4><p>This is another property in our current portfolio, and the initial exploration works were not successful. We will be emphasizing our exploration activities in the Agyurt area, one of our more promising sites, as we need to come up with a discovery by April 2012 otherwise we may lose the right to this mine. If we submit positive exploration results, we will be given the right to mine for the next 20 years.</p><h4>How would you assess Anglo-Asian Mining's contribution to the realization of Azerbaijan's full mining potential?</h4><p>Azerbaijan had never had a mining industry, and as a result we did not have mining experts. We have created them. We have created a skilled team that can operate in any type of mine anywhere in the world. We have trained our team from different perspectives, such as in processing, geology, mining, engineering, and the environment. Anglo-Asian Mining has created jobs, directly and indirectly, for over 1,000 people in rural Azerbaijan, where we have changed the economic environment. We have also developed community projects repairing roads and even building a whole new school for 400 students. We are partners with the government, which owns 51% of production after the deduction of capital and operational expenses, and so far we have given to the government of Azerbaijan close to $30 million in gold, which in my opinion would represent around 17,000 ounces.</p><h4>What is your evaluation of the sector's human capital in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>In my opinion it is very well educated, and Azerbaijanis are extremely fast learners; they are very adaptable to different circumstances. The Azerbaijani labor force is very talented. As an example, I would say that in our processing infrastructure at Gedabek we only have one expatriate; the rest are Azerbaijani. I am really happy to say that one of the most difficult mining sites in the world is almost totally run by Azerbaijani workers.</p><h4>What are the company's strategies to increase its volume of activity?</h4><p>We are currently negotiating for a few other concessions in Turkey, Albania, Georgia, and Kyrgyzstan. We have looked at different mining properties in these countries with similar sizes to the current properties we are handling. Anglo-Asian Mining wants to expand its activities throughout the region, for we aim to become a regional leader in the mining sector. We are very hopeful that during the first half of 2012 we can conclude one or two of the agreements I mentioned.</p><h4>How do you see the processing prospects of Azerbaijan in the extractive industries sector, and what business opportunities are there for local and foreign investors?</h4><p>Azerbaijan has an extremely high potential for mining. We have been pioneers in gold mining, but there are lots of other sites in Azerbaijan offering opportunities that have not been touched but contain deposits of metals, polymetals, copper, and probably zinc. We are in talks with the government in order to expand our segments of activity in the country, and I am sure there are plenty of other companies in Azerbaijan that have either obtained concessions or are looking into it. Overall, I am convinced that the industry offers plenty of opportunities for both local and foreign investors.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Avromed started operations in 2001. How has the company evolved since then?</h4><p>Avromed has gained wide experience since it launched its operations more than a decade ago. Avromed was founded in October 2001 and within one year we became the distributor of more than 20 leading European pharmaceutical companies, such as GlaxoSmithKline, Les Laboratoires Servier, Solvay Pharma, and Pfizer. By the end of 2003, the company enhanced its relationship with other European and American manufacturers, which allowed us to expand our product range. The company's revenues have considerably increased year by year and, for example, we closed 2011 with a turnover of more than AZN200 million. In that sense, our total turnover in 2010 was almost AZN140 million. Avromed has been growing more than 50% every single year. That means that we are going in the right direction. Our main principle is to deliver our products in no more than two hours no matter where the location. In line with this, we have seven regional branches and our network covers all the cities in Azerbaijan and I would say 99.9% of the whole national territory, except for the Armenian-occupied Nagorno-Karabakh region. In 2012 we will be opening two more regional branches, for we stress the quality of our services. Also, the company has a fleet of around 100 vehicles and three different warehouses, with the one in Baku being around 3,000 sqm. Since 2007 Avromed has been supplying nearly 50% of the tenders from the Ministry of Health, and of course, we also work with private hospitals. Avromed has its own pharmaceutical retail chain as well, which includes 180 drugstores across Azerbaijan. We currently employ more than 700 people, and around 60 of them are sales people who only serve the retail businesses in Baku.</p><h4>What evolution have you witnessed in terms of medical and pharmaceutical trends within the country?</h4><p>Over the last 10 years we have seen a shift in the manufacturers that are present in the market. Before, Soviet manufacturers used to dominate the market and people did not know much about European and American manufacturers. Nowadays, the situation has changed. Azerbaijan is a very open country and we can see representative offices of the best-known manufacturers in the world, such as Pfizer, GSK, Sanofi Aventis, and Novartis. That means that consumers are also looking to buy their products. We have seen an increasing interest among consumers in quality products. Therefore, the number of CIS producers has considerably decreased year-by-year, and European and American producers, due to their quality and worldwide reputation, have seen an increase in demand for their products. This trend has been palpable over the last few years, especially since Azerbaijan's population has increased their purchasing power.</p><h4>What are the main lines Avromed represents that differentiate its product range from other distributors in the market?</h4><p>Our suppliers are multinational companies such as GlaxoSmithKline, Aventis, Balkanpharma, Novartis, Les Laboratoires Servier, Sanofi, and Janssen-Cilag. Moreover, Avromed is an exclusive distributor of Pfizer, Alcon Pharmaceuticals, Novartis, Cheminova Internacional, Catalysis, Alfa Wassermann, Abdi Ibrahim, Jugoremedija, Jadran Galenski, Promed, and Octapharma. We currently have a supplier list of more than 190 pharmaceutical companies from 42 different countries. As a result, our services and wide range of products set Avromed apart from our competitors. Our company has the largest stock-keeping units (SKUs) in Azerbaijan with more than 15,000 in our price list, whereas our competitors have around 4,000 SKUs.</p><div class="quote">“Since 2007 Avromed has been supplying nearly 50% of the tenders from the Ministry of Health."</div><h4>What were the reasons that led to the launch of your joint venture with GlaxoSmithKline to set up vaccination clinics?</h4><p>About five years ago we started this important project with GlaxoSmithKline. We opened several vaccination rooms in different hospitals in Azerbaijan in order to provide jabs that had not yet been provided in the country. It has been a very successful project and now we are looking to expand vaccines in the field of newborn babies that suffer from lung diseases. We are developing a strategy with our suppliers GSK and Pfizer to import the jabs from European markets and distribute them in Azerbaijan.</p><h4>What are the main strategic plans Avromed has for 2012?</h4><p>We are planning to increase our drugstore chain and open two new regional branches in order to keep up our services both in Baku and regional Azerbaijan. Avromed will be expanding its marketing department, so we can increase our portfolio and bring more international companies to our country. Finally, one of our targets for 2012 is to further increase our cooperation and relationship with the Ministry of Health and other governmental institutions.</p><h4>What is your general outlook for the pharmaceutical sector over the medium term?</h4><p>The pharmaceutical market in Azerbaijan is very interesting, because at the moment we are attending to the formation of the whole market. We estimate that when medical insurance is implemented, the pharmaceutical sector can grow to twice its current size. There is big potential and I am sure we are headed in the right direction. Also, the number of CIS manufacturers is getting smaller, while their American and European counterparts are increasing their presence in Azerbaijan. That might have an impact on the market size as well. The economic status of Azerbaijan's population is steadily growing, and therefore people are increasingly opting for better treatment according to world standards, which enables businesses in this sector to develop in the right direction.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Caspel's background story as a main player in Azerbaijan's ICT sector?</h4><p>Caspel is one of the largest integrator companies in Azerbaijan, providing a full range of IT and telecommunications solutions. The company provides solutions for data transmission, software development, delivery, and the maintenance of advanced equipment from leading IT equipment producers and software developers. Caspel started operating in 1997 and a few years later, in 2005, we underwent a rebranding exercise in order to take the company forward. At present, we run our own fiber-optic network, and we provide the most effective project solutions to our customers through the use of the latest technology and the substantial experience of Caspel's key personnel. In that regard, I would like to note that when we first started, there were some 35 staff, whereas now there are around 200.</p><h4>In such a competitive environment, how has your company managed to maintain its growth over the years and keep the competition at bay?</h4><p>Telecommunications and information services are among the key business elements nowadays, and that generates a huge amount of business volume and opportunities. Government bodies, private companies, and other organizations need to manage large amounts of data and integrate their management systems. Over the years we have gained the trust of many customers and become very strong in sectors such as banking, where we have developed projects for key players. In addition, we have specialized our services, differentiating Caspel from its competitors. Our name is our brand, and the satisfaction of our customers and the successful implementation of large projects speak much about our position in the market.</p><div class="quote">“Telecommunications and information services are among the key business elements nowadays."</div><h4>How extensive is your fiber-optic network within Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Caspel has a large, extensive network that covers a large area of Azerbaijan, and many different government bodies and banks rely on our fiber-optic services. Over the last few years we have focused on the development of this network, and we are attracting more and more customers every day. At the moment, 70% of our customer base is from the banking sector, and the remaining 30% is split between government organizations, SMEs, and international oil companies. One of the advantages of our network is that we have our own data storage and backbone points, facilitating the transmission of data for our customers.</p><h4>What strategies have driven Caspel's partnership agreements?</h4><p>Caspel's activities are focused on four areas: integration, supply and solutions, service center support, and our help desk. We currently have 38 different partnerships with companies such as HP, Microsoft, Dell, Hitachi, Oracle, 3M, Legrand, Iskratel, Siemens, ZyXEL, and IBM, with which we work very closely. Our main aim is to provide global solutions to complex projects, and Caspel is taking advantage of the knowledge and products of such brands. At the same time, we provide a full range of services for these international companies in Azerbaijan.</p><h4>What are your views on Azerbaijan's potential role as a regional hub for the ICT sector?</h4><p>Azerbaijan's ICT sector is flourishing in the region. It is a politically stable country, the government's policies are in the right direction, and many different companies are driving the growth of the sector, which is actually developing along with the country's economy. In the near future we will see many Azerbaijani enterprises going abroad, especially to former Soviet republics and CIS countries. In that regard, Caspel does not exclude such a possibility either. We think the natural flow of the market and the sector will drive our operations in the future.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What significant reforms have taken place at the university since Azerbaijan gained independence?</h4><p>Azerbaijan Medical University (AMU) has had a long and very successful history since it was founded in 1930. The adoption of the credit system and the Bologna process are the most important reforms that have taken place at AMU since our country gained independence. It was a big challenge to go from a Soviet education system to the credit system. It is very important to us because it helps to bring international standards to our institution and further integrate it into the international higher education system. Along with the introduction of the credit system, we included postgraduate Master's degree courses in our Pharmacy Faculty in 2009, and residency courses in our General Medicine and Pediatrics faculties in 2011, which train residents from four to six years, depending on the specialty. We must not forget about the national reforms in higher education implemented by the Ministry of Education, because they have contributed to improving the quality of education in Azerbaijan and further raising it to meet European standards.</p><h4>How is the university working to further integrate itself into the world education system?</h4><p>AMU has different exchange programs with international institutions; not only at the student level, but specialists and staff as well. We currently have more than 40 partnerships and agreements with international universities. Also, we constantly invite education experts to attract their regulatory expertise to our country, and particularly to our institution. In that regard, the World Bank and the World Health Organization have been supporting us very closely over the years. Extracurricular activities play an important role in the education process, and we can develop them thanks to our international agreements. Also, the integration of IT systems in our programs and examination procedures, which are mostly based on European examination models, has seen the increased use of new technologies in our programs.</p><div class="quote">“The adoption of the credit system and the Bologna process are the most important reforms."</div><h4>What is the ratio of both local and foreign students at AMU?</h4><p>Today, AMU has more than 8,000 students. Around 1,000 of them are foreign students and they come from 18 different countries; some 350 foreign students graduate from our university every year. In my opinion, such figures represent our international recognition, which has been possible thanks to our highly educated and professional staff—we have more than 160 professors at the moment.</p><h4>Since 35% of Azerbaijani students abroad are from the medical sphere, how can AMU benefit from the changes the Ministry of Education is planning to make to the policy of financing the education of local university graduates overseas?</h4><p>The Ministry of Education is increasingly encouraging Azerbaijani students to follow their studies abroad, and this is very important not only for them, but for our educational institutions as well. More than 60% of the medical students who go on exchange programs come from our university. The most important thing, however, is to make sure that these students come back to Azerbaijan once they graduate. On our side, we work closely with the Ministry of Education in order to make sure we are ready to attract these students, providing what they professionally need to develop their careers in Azerbaijan. In this regard, we have built a new therapeutic center with 17 departments and 400 beds, and a surgery clinic with 21 departments, and extra capacity for 500 patients is under construction. We provide both clinics with the most modern equipment, and so doctors can develop their careers under the best conditions possible.</p><h4>How has the success of AMU been reflected worldwide?</h4><p>We like to keep track of our former students and residents, regardless of where they are working right now. An important factor that shows our success, as an educational institution, is the number of specialists who have graduated from AMU, and who are working abroad at the moment. A couple of years ago, coinciding with our 80th anniversary, we counted more than 10,000 specialists from our university working in 28 different countries. However, the number of our alumni spread across the world is growing from year to year. As an example, more than 40 students obtained residency in Germany in 2011. In Saudi Arabia we have more than 300 of our graduates working in different specialties. And in addition to all that, a large number of AMU alumni are successfully working and studying in Turkey and different European countries.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main axes of Ecuador's industrial development strategy?</h4><p>The government of Ecuador favors investments that will be profitable while adding value, generating social inclusion, and respecting the rights of nature, consumers, workers, and the state. Ecuador is the first country to recognize these rights as a legal body. Under these axes we are generating a productive economic model that contributes to economic growth and incorporates elements of sustainability.</p><h4>How competitive is Ecuador compared to other countries in the region?</h4><p>At a regional level, Ecuador is a very dynamic economy. We are currently witnessing positive economic developments in Latin America. Ecuador is fourth in the region in terms of GDP growth. In terms of competitiveness, a major aspect that has contributed to this level of growth has been the macroeconomic stability of Ecuador. In the World Economic Forum report for 2011, Ecuador's competitive ranking improved for the first time by four positions. In terms of macroeconomic stability, we hold 40th place among the 142 countries evaluated worldwide.</p><div class="quote">“Ecuador favors investments that will be profitable while adding value."</div><h4>How is the current administration improving the country's competitiveness?</h4><p>We are working hard to improve our efficiency and productivity alongside strong public investment to guarantee the best levels of competitiveness. Approximately 13% of GDP has been dedicated in 2011 to public investment in ports, airports, and road infrastructure. Public investment in 2011 totaled $8.45 billion, and in 2012 we forecast investment of over $10 billion. Estimated GDP growth will be between 13% and 14.18%. In roads, ports, airports, and agriculture the initial investment will be $1.22 billion. In terms of commercial policy, Ecuador is making big strides toward Asia, and many of the new investments in the country originate from there. China, South Korea, and Singapore are assisting us technically to improve our levels of development and competitiveness. We want to overcome the model that characterized Ecuador for decades, based on the extraction of non-renewable resources. Now we want to transform that model into value-added based on knowledge and high technology.</p><h4>What specific investments have been made to develop the country technologically?</h4><p>We have signed a strategic alliance with South Korea to develop a “Knowledge City" in Ecuador that will incorporate only the highest available technology in the field of scientific research and work toward reducing the technological gap. This is a must if we are to change our economic model. Since the President's visit to South Korea, some agreements have been established for the transfer of technical know-how and for the incentivization of commercial exchange.</p><h4>What are the goals of the government's economic development model for the country?</h4><p>Our model for industrial development, on top of generating value-added, will create opportunities for the development of new businesses. In the country's last census, small enterprises were clearly identified as the engines of growth. During President Correa's administration over 90,000 small enterprises have been created, employing between one and nine people each. In the long term, this is a development model through which the government co-finances innovation using several mechanisms in order to reinforce the productive capacity of the country. Also during the Correa administration, employment has grown by 7.59%, while the unemployment rate has been reduced to 2.19%, and underemployment to 4.71%. We have one of the lowest unemployment rates in the region.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the main factors driving the decision to build a new airport in Quito?</h4><p>The current airport was built 60 years ago, meaning it has aged somewhat. Also, it is located in the middle of the city, lies at a high altitude, and cannot operate flights of longer than three or four hours. The new airport, on the other hand, will be operable for transcontinental flights. It's at a lower altitude and has a longer runway.</p><h4>What technical challenges have been faced during the construction of the airport?</h4><p>We carried out intense studies in order to construct the new airport. It rivals airports in Europe or North America for quality. With regard to facilities, no other airport in Latin America can rival it. The construction process has been lengthy due to the fact that the site is surrounded by three volcanoes and lies in an area that is prone to seismic activity. I'm not aware of any airport in the region or possibly the world that has taken the kind of precautions we have.</p><div class="quote">“We carried out intense studies in order to construct the new airport."</div><h4>What state-of-the-art technologies will make it possible for the airport to remain open even under severe emergency conditions?</h4><p>We have bolstered the roof with a lot of steel. Some people consider this too much, but the airport needs to withstand heavy ash fall in the case of a volcanic eruption. Also, we installed a five-centimeter channel throughout the airport to accommodate a very flexible plastic material that reinforces the building against earthquakes. The new airport can sustain an earthquake ranking nine on the Richter magnitude scale. We have also installed a unique fire-resistant foam in the walls that can survive temperatures up to 700oC.</p><h4>The new airport will be the first “green" airport on the continent. How have you worked to reduce the environmental impact of the airport?</h4><p>This airport was built entirely with green-fueled technology, and it was important to us to do this and take construction to a higher level. This has never been done in the region. In fact, there's a prize from the UN in my office for best practice of environmental sustainability in the Americas for 2007. Next to that you can see another one from the UN for social responsibility in 2010. We have changed the face of social and environmental responsibility. For example, during the construction phase, all of the villagers around the airport were involved. We trained them in planning, provided English lessons, and helped them to handle the changes and maintain their communities. We felt that it was important to reduce the impact of the airport on their daily lives. We're doing everything we can to have a positive impact on these communities, and we're quite aware of the problems a new airport can bring to a community. It was possible to implement these social and environmental policies in large part because the construction companies we worked with came from Canada.</p><h4>What level of interest have airlines expressed in the new airport?</h4><p>We're seeing more and more airlines interested all the time. United Airlines and Continental want to start flying from Chicago to here. They don't do it now because they can't fly a direct route, and lose a lot of money flying into another airport first. Delta wants to pick up more flights from New York and Dallas, Air Mexico wants to start a flight from Mexico City, and Air Canada would like to start flying from Toronto. We're also in discussions with Brazil's TAM Airlines, and also with Air France to schedule flights from Paris. Martinair and TLN are flying here, and they're partnered with Air France. However, a lot of people fly from here to Bogotá via Air France, and so we think that airline may also begin to look more seriously at the new airport.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>After 25 years in the country, how significant is Ecuador for the company?</h4><p>Ecuador has been and remains a cornerstone for the company´s international operations. During these 25 years in Ecuador we have been bilateral trade promoters in the export of engineering and construction services from Brazil to Ecuador, developing projects worth over $1 billion, most of them with official financial support from Brazil. Ecuador's importance for the company is further reflected in the more than 700 Ecuadoreans currently working for the organization both in Ecuador and abroad. Odebrecht is a global company with a local presence. We strive to act like a local company in every country we are present, thus providing global know-how and resources to address local needs, while adapting to local conditions, seeking and training qualified and motivated individuals, and becoming part of the countries we are in.</p><h4>In what sectors has Odebrecht been involved since it entered the country?</h4><p>Every developing country presents considerable challenges and opportunities for construction companies. Ecuador is no exception, especially in the areas of energy, water, waste-water treatment, and intermodal infrastructure projects such as roads and harbors. Our previous projects in Ecuador have been related to water management and flood-prevention infrastructure, as river basins experience extreme flooding and drought cycles almost every year. The importance of flood control and the potential benefits and impact of these types of projects on the economy and well-being of the population and the environmental importance of proper water management practices motivates us to stick to these types of activities.</p><div class="quote">“We strive to act as a local company with global expertise."</div><h4>What are the main projects Odebrecht is working on at this moment?</h4><p>We are currently working on the rehabilitation of the Pucara Hydropower Plant, which provides 73 MW of capacity to the national grid, and we were recently awarded a contract for the construction of Manduriacu, with an estimated capacity of 60 MW, the first of seven hydropower plants that will be installed along the Guayllabamba River basin.</p><h4>How has the company's semi-autonomy from its headquarters in Brazil allowed you to develop relationships with local firms?</h4><p>We strive to act as a local company with global expertise, and thus we tend to establish partnerships with local firms as much as possible. However, any partnership is like a marriage, where the parties have to know each other well and share the same principles and goals. Therefore, we seek companies with similar standards of excellence and performance and which have a genuine commitment to fulfill our clients' needs. During our years in Ecuador we have developed a very solid network of local construction partners, banks, insurance companies, and others. We have grown with our partners and look forward to future opportunities together as well as establishing new partnerships with other firms.</p><h4>What opportunities are there for diversification?</h4><p>Odebrecht is always looking for new opportunities in construction and in many other areas, such as energy (whether as a contractor or as a concession operator), oil and gas, petrochemicals, industrial water and sewage treatment, and ethanol production. If opportunities arise we are willing to venture into these areas.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was behind the decision to move the company's headquarters to the US?</h4><p>That's something that reflects our vision of becoming a more inter-American company, and we've found that we do have the capacity to attract technical talent and grow at a certain speed outside of Ecuador. It has been focused primarily on establishing a presence in the US, to help us grow in that market, and to become a more inter-American company.</p><h4>What has made Cobiscorp unique in the market?</h4><p>There are several issues, but one of them has been a long trajectory in the Latin American space. We have over 70 clients in 14 countries and we are focused very much on being one of the leading solutions providers for the Latin American market. By homing in on that market and developing its needs, our product has developed a very strong and wide functionality, and we have grown in the region. We have local offices in North, Central, and South America. The other thing that differentiates us is being concentrated on the market; being a local player gives us cultural advantages and language advantages, and this translates into benefits for our clients. Gartner Consulting, in its analysis of the core banking space, has selected Cobiscorp as one of the top-20 core banking solutions in the world.</p><div class="quote">“We have over 70 clients in 14 countries."</div><h4>What are some of the key challenges Cobiscorp faces in the sector?</h4><p>The challenges are growing as a company, being able to form and train the human capital that is required, to understand the technology, our applications, and to also understand our clients' business, and doing that in a new language. The people we bring in can also represent us strongly in a market the size and nature of the US.</p><h4>How diversified is Cobiscorp's product portfolio?</h4><p>Within the banking system we are banking technology partners. We are very focused on that vertical space of banking technology. And within that space we have clients from all sectors and all sizes. For example, in our portfolio we have names like Citibank, HSBC, Scotiabank, Banco General, and Banco Macro—all world-class players. We also boast regional banks as clients, and we have local public banks, private mezzanine banks, and commercial banks, all the way down to savings and loans cooperatives and microfinance institutions. Overall, we are strictly focused on the finance sector.</p><h4>Are you currently working on new technologies or applications at Cobiscorp?</h4><p>We have a roadmap that has been guiding where we are going, not only in regards to technology but also functionality, for example on what's happening in the world of mobile banking, internet banking, and cloud-based software and applications. The nature of our business makes it essential for us to be able to follow technology and business trends in the industry.</p><h4>How much does Cobiscorp invest annually in research for new applications and products?</h4><p>We are investing about 15% to 20% of our revenues into R&amp;D to keep our products up to date. Most application development is done in Ecuador, primarily. We also work with geographically dispersed teams collaborating toward specific projects. Management systems such as Microsoft Lync, and Microsoft CRM are now readily available in the market, and we have been successful in making them a part of our corporate culture.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the company sought to engage with the Ecuadorean market over the past decade?</h4><p>Since the beginning there has been a very experienced and knowledgeable group of people managing the company. We worked with a company called Techint Engineering &amp; Construction, which was very effective. Our management team was able to handle all political and media issues in the early days, and we thus became the operator of the nation's heavy crude pipeline. The project was completed in two years, which is a very short time to build such a long pipeline. The project finally cost more than we had originally predicted, since we encountered a number of unpredicted difficulties and faced a natural disaster in the form of the Reventador volcano eruption, but we couldn't stop once the project had started. Financing was fluid during the project. A clause in the contract with the government stated that fines would be applied should the project be delayed. It was a great project, and the oil was waiting to be transported, so there was a big incentive to complete the work.</p><h4>What are the current day-to-day challenges for OCP?</h4><p>One challenge is that production hasn't increased as we expected. Although the expectation at the time was to transport 350,000 barrels per day (bbl/d), we finally agreed with the government to build it with a 450,000-bbl/d capacity. However, it currently only transports around 150,000 bbl/d. The project was based on a project finance structure, meaning the owners, who are also our shippers, agreed to pay for capacity rights and not actual transported volumes as a way to guarantee enough cash flow to be able to repay the financiers of the project.</p><div class="quote">“Since the beginning there has been a very experienced and knowledgeable group of people managing the company."</div><h4>What is the strategic importance of the interconnection framework agreement signed with Petroecuador?</h4><p>At the beginning of our operations we signed an agreement to share 60 kilometers of the Trans-Ecuadorian Oil Pipeline System's (SOTE) right of way. We needed to learn how to live together, and that agreement was a way to define how we were going to work together over that 60-kilometer stretch of pipeline. We are currently applying that agreement and it's working well. Additionally, since the beginning of our operations, we saw the need to interconnect both pipelines. At one point SOTE had a problem with heavy rain, and services were suspended. We had to transport most of the oil through the interconnection of both pipelines. However, when after service was completed, the interconnection was deactivated. We have now decided that both systems should be permanently interconnected. This is not something that will allow us to do any more business; it's something we believe is necessary for transportation security in case of an emergency. There are four such contracts that we are planning to sign, and another will take place later in 2012. The Esmeraldas Refinery, under Petroecuador—the national oil company—is about to undergo regular maintenance, and extra storage capacity will be required, which we can provide. We are planning to interconnect our marine terminal and the SOTE terminal at Esmeraldas so we can provide Petroecuador with storage as well as ship-loading services. We also believe that there's a good opportunity for OCP to transport Colombian crude oil, and for that reason we are also working with Petroecuador on interconnecting the different pipelines near Lago Agrio.</p><h4>What benefits will being connected to Colombia's oil fields bring?</h4><p>We expect that the first phase will yield a capacity of around 15,000 bbl/d. The first phase is a test of our abilities. We have to adapt to dealing with issues like customs, for example. In the second phase we plan to increase the transportation volume to between 150,000 and 180,000 bbl/d. This will double our capacity utilization rate. We believe that this project may completely change this company and the situation of our shareholders. Up to 50% of the volumes they are not able to transport may be covered by this one project alone.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2011</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was behind the difficulty faced in reinvigorating the market, and how is Kazphosphate positioned today?<br></h4><p>After the Soviet Union collapsed the demand for products such as yellow phosphorus and fertilizers was very low. Farmers could not afford fertilizers as their priority was oil and machinery when managing their funds. Since 1999 we have been trying to focus on facilities that will have more effect. We dedicated ourselves to rehabilitating the mining industry. Along with that we have been conducting market research to identify the demand for our products. Over a 10-year time period we re-established a customer base, and now our capacity of yellow phosphorus is 120,000 tons per year, whereas exports make up to 60,000 tons per year, which is mainly consumed by our European customers. Establishing ourselves in the European market was difficult due to the breakdown of trust that occurred following the collapse of the Soviet Union. However, as to our calculations we now have approximately an 80% share of the European market for yellow phosphorus. To supply European customers we use rail deliveries; however, exports to regions such as India or other emerging markets are currently not possible due to the geographical distance between our region and the main demand markets, which consequently leads to higher logistics costs.</p><h4>What trends are you expecting in the fertilizer marketplace?</h4><p>China is the price setter, and every producer is following what is happening there. Currently, the fertilizer market is stabilizing in terms of price after the economic downturn. We now observe a solid pricing trend. Existing increases in food prices will of course impact fertilizer prices, and we can already see the evidence for prices going forward. Along with that, rising global concern over food supply chain stability and raw material prices being on the rise will have an impact on prices. We believe that this market will continue to grow, attracting many potential investors in the coming years.</p><div class="quote">“Over a 10-year time period we re-established a customer base, and now our capacity of yellow phosphorus is 120,000 tons per year."</div><h4>What role can your sector play in the diversification of the economy?</h4><p>We have several investment projects associated with upgrading the quality of our products and reducing our costs. Undertaking these projects should allow us to expand our product portfolio, and therefore to offer our customers a solid range of products at competitive prices.</p><p>Among other projects that our company have undertaken is the production of new phosphate derivatives for animal feed. This is a big contribution from our side for the sector, which shall bring new customers and new markets to our company and therefore revenues and allocations to the state's budget.</p><p>In 2013 we are planning to start the production of pesticides. This has become possible due to the local chemical industry in general developing to a point whereby both upstream and downstream production has been significantly improved.</p><p>We are an innovation-minded company and we utilize new technologies to produce products with higher value-added. To achieve our objectives in terms of higher value-added products we have set up joint ventures with international chemical companies that share their technologies and experience with us. Therefore, we are proud to state that we support Kazakhstan's chemical and agrochemical industry through innovation and cooperation with different local and international supply chain members.</p><h4>How is Kazphosphate financed?</h4><p>Over the last decade we have proved that we are a self-sufficient company. We have a strong market share and produce sufficiently due to the diversification of our product range and the volume of exports we undertake to international markets. In terms of financing, we have two options. We acquire financing from local bodies such as Samruk-Kazyna, and we also get financial support from foreign investment institutions such as HSBC and ATF. International cooperation with chemical companies from different parts of the world as well brings additional funding, which supports our operations.</p><h4>What opportunities do you see for foreign investors in your industry?</h4><p>The local agrochemical and chemical industries are developing well, meaning that foreign investors are focusing on this market. Along with that, they know what the investment climate in Kazakhstan is like. To be specific, we have observed interest from different companies representing states such as Russia, India, and China. Of course, this interest is focused on various areas of our industry, and we also need to consider some strategic long-term partnerships. Keeping this in mind we meet with all interested strategic investors who know that we are a company with a stable position in the local phosphate sector, sufficient infrastructure, up-to-date rock processing facilities, and human resources, and we also have an extensive mining base that includes six operating phosphate deposits. We perform all functions in a vertically integrated business model from exploration to the end product, and this attracts investors.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2011</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Kazakhstan is considered a success story in terms of engaging with the global market place. What have been the defining elements of the country's vision with regard to integrating itself into the global economy?<br></h4><p>Since independence, President Nazarbayev's policy has been to diversify the economy and create ties with trade partners. This policy has been successful and well balanced. We work in cooperation with the EU, which is Kazakhstan's biggest trade partner. We would like to be a platform and a hub for European activity in Central Asia. We have had long and fruitful relations with Russia and other CIS countries, and that has kept economic relations positive. With the implementation of the Customs Union, we are moving closer to the Belarus and Russian economies. We hope to expand this into a Eurasian Economic Community and Unique Economic Space in the future. We also have very strong relations with our neighbor China, and we are working on large-scale projects to build gas pipelines and a highway from China to Europe across Kazakhstan. We are also cooperating with our eastern neighbor under the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. In relation to foreign economic relations, we have attracted $120 billion of FDI over the last two decades. Among our investors are large US companies like Chevron, and very influential European companies such as Total and ENI. In 2010, GDP growth reached 7%. We anticipate similar growth over the upcoming years. GDP per capita will also be around $15,000. These figures outstrip all other Central Asian countries combined. Additionally, in 2010, Kazakhstan took over the OSCE chairmanship, and the annual OSCE meeting was held in Astana in 2010, which was a superb opportunity to show off the development Kazakhstan has undergone. A recent European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) meeting held in Astana also showed off the investment potential of the country. Nearly 2,500 guests and participants were in attendance.</p><h4>What were some of the key measures the government took to alleviate the effects of the global financial crisis on the local economy?</h4><p>Kazakhstan felt the first signs of the financial crisis before other CIS countries because our banking sector was very closely linked to the financial institutions of Western countries. From the beginning of 2007 we experienced problems in the financial system, when Lehman Brothers collapsed. Steps were taken by the President to join the two funds, Samruk and Kazyna. Additionally, $10 billion was allocated for anti-crisis measures, and this played a big role in strengthening the economy. We have used the financial resources of our National Stabilization Fund, which is an analog of the Norwegian Oil Fund, to store extra oil revenues. The national welfare fund Samruk-Kazyna, after becoming the anti-crisis operator of the government, did a great job in solving the problems of the banking sector, the construction sector, SMEs, and the industrial sector. These sectors of the economy had suffered the most from the crisis. The four largest banks in the country have avoided financial problems, and some of them avoided even collapse during this period. I should mention that they had debts of more than $40 billion. We started discussions with creditors on restructuring the debts of the banks, and after 18 months of discussions agreements were made. We have stabilized the finance sector of the country and kept the trust of the population in the banks. In 2008-2009, the most pressing issue for entrepreneurs was the rise in interest rates on credits. The state conducted a refinancing of earlier granted credits and a lowering of rates on new loans for business opening and development. It supported more than 10,000 businesses, creating and maintaining more than 19,000 work places over the last four years. Construction and real estate companies received finance from the anti-crisis operator, and this has helped to stabilize and boost the sector.</p><div class="quote">“In relation to foreign economic relations, we have attracted $120 billion of FDI over the last two decades."</div><h4>How would you assess Kazakhstan's strengths and prospects in the Customs Union?</h4><p>The Customs Union is a big event in the economic lives of Kazakhstan, Belarus, and Russia. It has brought a new dynamic to our relations. The implementation of the Customs Union began in 2010, and according to the latest statistics internal trade has grown 30% between Russia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan. It is a huge market of 170 million people, and Kazakhstan's big companies and SMEs will get an opportunity to export their products to this large market. All companies will be granted equal access to infrastructure, to the market, and to new technologies, promoting joint projects and joint ventures. This will be key in developing our competitiveness. It is absolutely evident that the Customs Union gives us more opportunities.</p><h4>According to the World Bank's Doing Business 2011 report, Kazakhstan is one of the top reformers in the world. What were some of the key policy decisions taken and reforms made to achieve this improved status?</h4><p>We have done all we can to create a comfortable and easy environment for investors to operate within. This has been accomplished by creating predictable rules for investors. There has also been an increase in the number of economic and business conferences held here in Kazakhstan, and this has been positive. The special Foreign Investment Council under the President works to achieve these goals, and all key investors meet twice a year and discuss the challenges that are faced and solutions are found. We are competing to create a better investment climate. We are now also working to improve the legal atmosphere and develop the visa regime, as well as customs regimes. In terms of improving business procedures, a program is being implemented by the government to reduce bureaucracy. The number of licenses and permissions required to operate a business will be cut. This will help in attracting more investment both domestic and foreign.</p><h4>Kazakhstan has a comprehensive agenda to diversify its economy through accelerated industrialization. In which non-prime sectors of the economy does Kazakhstan have the strongest competitive edge?</h4><p>Having recovered from the crisis, Kazakhstan is now moving into a post-crisis development phase, with a large emphasis on infrastructure and investment projects within the framework of diversifying the economy. Kazakhstan's post-crisis concentration will also be on motivating large investors and national companies to launch joint strategies and mutually linked industrial projects. We will also continue focus on investment projects in basic industries such as oil and gas, mining, uranium, and the chemical industry. Now, our main task is to use our competitive advantages in the raw material sectors; for instance, if we have an oil and gas resource, we should develop a refinery, and develop the petrochemical and chemical sector. Likewise, we have to develop a modern metallurgy sector to complement the mining sector. Also, we should develop the atomic energy sector to take advantage of our uranium reserves. Kazakhstan is among the largest reserve holders in the world and is on track to become the world's largest uranium producer. In accordance with basic industries we need to develop all required infrastructure, including transport, telecommunications, and electricity supply. Both directions help to build up a strong competitive economy. The most promising sector of our economy is the agriculture sector. This country is the among top 10 exporters of the grain in the world. In that respect, we aim to be a big exporter of agri-food products and grain to our powerful neighbors such as Russia and China.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2011</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess Kazakhmys' contribution to the realization of Kazakhstan's full mining potential?<br></h4><p>We are currently developing two of the largest projects in Kazakhstan, Aktogay and Bozshakol. Each of these requires around $2 billion of capital investment and will increase Kazakhstan's copper output by over 50%. We will also spend some $70 million on exploration in 2011. This is probably the biggest program of its kind in the country.</p><h4>Recently, Kazakhmys decided not to issue new shares on the Hong Kong Stock exchange despite the board's approval of the secondary listing. What factors have led the Group not to commit to a second listing?</h4><p>We have completed our listing on the Hong Kong stock exchange. At some point we would like to issue a modest amount of shares in Hong Kong, in order to assist liquidity. We believe there is good demand in Hong Kong, but these shares can only be issued at a price and valuation that makes sense to existing shareholders. We think the outlook for copper is positive, which is the main driver of our share price, and so there should be an opportunity in the next 18 months.</p><div class="quote">“The Central Asian region is where we can operate most comfortably, as we understand it so well."</div><h4>What is the status of Bozshakol and Aktogay growth projects? What level of impact are you expecting in Kazakhmys' operations and profitability once production starts as scheduled in three to four years?</h4><p>Each of these projects represents around 100 kilotons of copper a year, compared to our current production of 300 kilotons, so it is a substantial uplift. The profitability obviously depends on metals prices at the time, but we believe they are both economically attractive projects. Bozshakol is just completing its feasibility study and should move into development at the end of 2011, with first production in 2015. Aktogay is around 12 months behind Bozshakol and should move into feasibility during 2011. Most importantly, we have $2.7 billion of funding from the China Development Bank, which will fund Bozshakol and our mid-sized projects, and we recently signed an MoU with the CDB for $1.5 billion, which if completed will be used towards Aktogay.</p><h4>Kazakhmys have precious metal mines outside Kazakhstan. Provided the profitability of the Group and increasing commodities prices, what are your plans for expanding your operations to other areas outside the CIS?</h4><p>We have stated that we will look at opportunities to diversify principally in Central Asia. This will be achieved through exploration and by acquiring known assets. The Central Asian region is where we can operate most comfortably, as we understand it so well. It is also a vast and mineral rich area. We will look elsewhere, but we have to be sure that we understand and can manage the risks.</p><h4>Diversification of the economy and accelerated industrialization are important agenda items for the government. How do you see processing prospects of Kazakhstan in extractive industries? What business opportunities are there for local and foreign investors?</h4><p>This is an interesting question for Kazakhmys—we are already far more involved in processing than our international peer group. We are fully integrated, so that all of the ore we mine is processed through to finished metal and around 25% is then taken further to copper rod. This is highly unusual for a major copper company. We have also worked with the government to establish the “made in Kazakhstan" program, which aims to encourage local companies to come forward and supply materials and parts. Kazakhstan itself has a number of key advantages for future development. The land is naturally rich in resources, with a wide range of commercially attractive deposits, and strong and reliable transport links. The country has a strong track record in attracting FDI, which has amounted to over $120 billion since independence in 1991.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2011</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Tell us about some of the core strategies that you have instituted at Delta Bank during your time as chairperson?<br></h4><p>I've been with Delta Bank for more than two years. It's historically been a small bank, yet whereas the bank assets were worth something like KZT25 billion, that has now doubled. The same goes for the bank's net capital, which has increased from KZT5.6 billion at the end of 2008 to KZT11.6 billion at the end of 2010. Additionally, according to Moody's, Delta Bank has a higher-than-sector average level of capital adequacy. I'm very proud to be a part of this bank and to have played a role in its rapid development. In fact, a lot of the development's took place during the crisis, with Delta Bank vastly increasing its assets and capital over that period specifically.</p><h4>What was the secret to Delta Bank's strong operating performance over that period in the country's economic history?</h4><p>Although we were a relatively small, unknown bank two years ago, among our main advantages was that we worked with some very sound corporate customers, most of who were from the SME segment. We decided to focus on our existing clients, to offer them new products, and to generally build on Delta Bank's core strengths, the foremost of which is our speed and flexibility in rendering the services our customers seek and need. This growth has also been reflected in the development of our human capital, with more people having been hired to support the bank's developing operations.</p><div class="quote">“We think 2011 will be a bright year for Kazakhstan. All the indicators point to continued growth."</div><h4>How would you assess your current market position? How do you differentiate your services in areas where there is more competition?</h4><p>I think the market position of Delta Bank is strong enough in the small banks' segment. The most encouraging aspect is that such banks are strengthening every year. As for the number of branches our bank has advantages compared to other banks that are of more or less the same size in terms of assets. In 2010 Delta Bank opened two new branches in Pavlodar and Petropavlovsk and the branch network consisted of 11 branches, 7 additional offices, and 1 representative office. In 2011 we are planning to open one more branch in Ust-Kamenogorsk, and additional offices throughout Kazakhstan for individual customers, mainly.</p><h4>What is your opinion of the general level of development in the banking and financial sectors in Kazakhstan overall?</h4><p>We were very proud of the financial and banking sector before the beginning of the crisis in 2007. The crisis was an experience for Kazakhstan, and the sector has learnt from it and it has helped the country to develop further. Overall, we have a good finance and banking sector, as we must if Kazakhstan is going to continue developing and integrating with the world economy.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2011 in Kazakhstan and beyond from a banking perspective?</h4><p>We think 2011 will be a bright year for Kazakhstan. All the indicators point to continued growth. Considering that Kazakhstan's economy proved its viability in 2010—with GDP growth at 7%, and a stable national currency—I think Kazakh banks will face the issue of expanding lending to the real sector in 2011. It's time to move on, keeping in mind the lessons of crisis.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2011</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>CAMECO Corporation is one of the world's largest uranium producers, roughly accounting for 16% of global production. How has your business evolved since your entry into the Kazakh market?<br></h4><p>In its early years as a publicly traded company, CAMECO's uranium production was centered in Canada. Right after Kazakhstan gained its independence CAMECO was one of the first to recognize Kazakhstan's huge potential for uranium production, although the full extent of that potential was not known at the time. We saw potential early on that, by producing in Kazakhstan, we could diversify our production base, which is a value to our customers as production risk is spread over several production centers in different countries. The first visit by CAMECO to Kazakhstan took place in 1992, early exploration and development work led to the formation of the joint venture between CAMECO and Kazatomprom in 1996. In 1999 our joint venture received a license and in 2000 the sub-soil use contract was signed to develop the significant uranium deposit at Inkai. Now, more than a decade later, Inkai is taking its place as an important production center for both companies, producing over 1,600 metric tons of uranium (MtU) in 2010. We have promoted Inkai as a success story through the President's Foreign Investment Council. Opening our office in Astana in 2010, in addition to the long-established JV Inkai offices in Almaty and Taikonur, shows action on our commitment to Kazakhstan. CAMECO's growth strategy is to double its annual uranium production to 40 million pounds by 2018 and Inkai is a key component of our plan. We value our relationships with Kazatomprom and the Kazakh government authorities, and are pleased to be a partner in establishing this region as a sustainable, reliable uranium production center for the long term.</p><h4>How has the CAMECO culture contributed to the development of Kazakhstan's energy potential?</h4><p>CAMECO has extensive experience and expertise to share with our Kazakh partners to operate uranium mines to the highest environmental and worker health and safety standards. We can also offer access to our proprietary refining and conversion technology. One of the key strategic goals of our partner Kazatomprom is to build a vertically integrated company with capabilities in mining, conversion, enrichment, and fuel fabrication. We, as a partner, can support Kazatomprom to achieve its strategic goal. CAMECO, with its strong financial position, also brings direct foreign financing to the country and we were responsible for financing the initial capital costs of Inkai.</p><div class="quote">“Since its independence, Kazakhstan has consistently proven its commitment to nuclear non-proliferation."</div><h4>President Nazarbayev expressed Kazakhstan's will to host a nuclear fuel bank. How realistic is it that the country will produce fuel and become the center of nuclear fuel trade?</h4><p>President Nursultan Nazarbayev is a well-recognized international leader with a very strong agenda for nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear safety. Since its independence, Kazakhstan has consistently proven its commitment to nuclear non-proliferation and has many of the supporting factors to accommodate and host a nuclear fuel bank if and when it is created by the international community. As part of its strategic goals, Kazatomprom is working to build its own fuel fabrication capability in Kazakhstan.</p><h4>How do you see Kazakhstan's agenda for power generation via nuclear power plants?</h4><p>Most of the growing world demand for power is coming from the emerging economies. That is why we share a strong view of the future of the nuclear industry as one of the key elements of the overall energy mix. Early discussions are ongoing at the government level to build a nuclear power plant in Kazakhstan and safety is obviously an important part of that discussion, especially after the recent events at Fukushima. Kazakhstan can have nuclear energy in its overall energy mix in the long-term perspective.</p><h4>How do you see the interplay of the political will and the legal framework? What steps can be taken to carry the nuclear agenda forward?</h4><p>Although oil and gas are a big part of the Kazakh economy, Kazakhstan's uranium sector is a much bigger part of the world's nuclear industry. The government understands its leading role in the sector and we expect Kazakhstan to become an even bigger part of the world nuclear industry. Kazakhstan has an open economy that is mostly driven by commodities. There is a strong desire to diversify the economy, plans to improve the business environment and invest in infrastructure, and an understanding of the importance of foreign investment.</p><h4>What is your outlook with respect to supply and demand for nuclear fuel in the post-Fukushima world?</h4><p>Each form of power generation, be it nuclear, coal, or gas, has its own safety challenges. The nuclear industry worldwide, and in Kazakhstan, has a very strong safety culture. After Fukushima we expect that newly constructed nuclear plants will go through even more rigorous safety reviews by regulators. Nuclear will continue to be a part of the energy mix as it's clean, economically viable, and the industry is much better and experienced now at running nuclear power plants. We believe that long-term demand for nuclear energy will not be affected by the events at Fukushima in any major way.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2011</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Kcell developed since its inception in 1998?<br></h4><p>It's been more than 12 years now since the first commercial launch of GSM-900 standard. President Nazarbayev participated in the official launch ceremony of Kcell's mobile network. We are proud to state that Kcell was the first to give all Kazakhstani people a unique opportunity for integration into the global information network of GSM standard mobile communications. Since then, owing to our dynamic investment approach as well as the support of our shareholders—Europe's fifth largest cellular operator TeliaSonera, and Kazakhtelecom—the national telecommunications infrastructure has become one of the most advanced among CIS countries. The development of mobile communication systems has made a significant contribution into the local economy. Based on industrial experts' opinions, the increase in mobile communication penetration resulted in further growth of local GDP from 1 % to 1.6%. For information, the current nominal cellular communication penetration within Kazakhstan exceeds 100%. I believe those figures speak for themselves. For the past 12 years Kcell has invested over $1.7 billion into telecom infrastructure development, thus becoming one of the biggest investors of the non-oil-and-gas sector. By looking at those figures from a different perspective, please note that in 1999 we launched the operation in Almaty only, and acquiring the 10,000th subscriber was a big step for us. As of today, the number of registered subscribers has reached over 9 million. From a technical perspective, we started operation by using a few base stations within one city, and as of now we have more than 5,000 of them all over the country. Our network covers more than 81% of Kazakhstan's populated area, and as of today Kcell operates in 2,621 cities and towns, which comprises 100% coverage of locations with more than 5,000 people, and 82% coverage of locations with more than 2,000 people. The plan is to provide mobile communications to all locations with over 1,000 people by 2013. We launched 3G in 2010 to support the OSCE Summit and acted as the 7th Asian Winter Games as official mobile operator. As of today our 3G network is working in 32 cities built on over 900 base stations.</p><h4>How would you assess the Kcell's performance and vision as a pioneer in innovative technologies?</h4><p>Kcell aims to provide world-class services and we pursue this objective with confidence through improvements in our tariff policy and our quality of service at all levels. Kcell has always been a trendsetter and we are leading the development of the telecommunications market in Kazakhstan. We shall continue doing this in 2011, introducing new 3G services, which not only meet but also form market demands. For instance, we plan to provide universal services so that telephones can serve as modems, bankcards, and electronic door keys. We're also ready to launch 4G/LTE. I'm sure this is a good prospective for the further development of the Kazakhstani telecommunications market, which we hope will be realized in the near future with the most active participation of our company.</p><div class="quote">“For the past 12 years Kcell has invested over $1.7 billion into telecom infrastructure development."</div><h4>How can the telecommunications sector contribute to the development of the non-prime economy?</h4><p>Kazakhstan has a challenging strategy to become one of the most competitive economies. Penetration and the availability of mobile telecoms services as well as the speed of mobile broadband data traffic in mobile networks are the key factors in rating the most competitive economies. This is an obvious fact that drives economic development, too. However, Kazakhstan's economy is too much dependent on raw materials and oil and gas production, and of course the price levels of these substances on the international market. State authorities are heavily working on diversifying the economy under the close supervision of President Nazarbayev. However, these are all long-term initiatives and one should not expect any results overnight. In my view, in addition to all the underground treasures Kazakhstan has, agricultural products—as well as their preservation and storage—and the transportation sector will play an important role in the country's economy, too. When it comes to telecommunications, there will always be a need.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2011</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Esteemed Mr. President, how would you assess the success of the implementation of Kazakhstan's accelerated industrial-innovation development plan? What has been achieved and what remains to be done?<br></h4><p>Accelerated industrialization is a step forward; one of the main thoroughfares of Kazakhstan's journey into the 21st century. The whole of Kazakhstan is overlaid with this idea. The industrial might of the country is growing stronger before our eyes. At this moment, in the framework of the Industrialization Map, by 2015 some 469 investment projects worth $56.7 billion are planned. There will be more than 300,000 jobs created. In 2010 we opened 152 facilities worth $5.5 billion, and 23,000 Kazakhstanis found permanent employment. In the first half of 2011, 75 investment projects worth $778 million were implemented. More than 6,000 Kazakhstanis found a stable source of income. By the end of the year, some 130 projects worth $4.2 billion will be completed. We are already observing the positive effects of the measures we have taken. According to the statistics, over the first half of 2011 Kazakhstan's GDP grew by 7%. Industrial production is up by 5.8%, while growth in the manufacturing industry stood at 8.7%. Unemployment decreased to 5.4%. With the entry of new businesses at full capacity, many more socio-economic indicators will improve.</p><h4>In your state of the union address at the beginning of 2011 you announced a comprehensive social modernization program. What work is being done in this direction?</h4><p>The main criterion for assessing the success of a country is the wellbeing of its citizens. Therefore, for us, achieving a European standard of living constitutes the main task of social modernization. We will enhance the quality of the education system, health care, and employment. The living standards for all of Kazakhstan's citizens will be improved. Over 2011 the pensions, allowances, and salaries of civil servants increased by 30%. Soon we will hold the first “People's IPO". The general public of Kazakhstan will be able to purchase shares in national companies and invest in the domestic economy. Social modernization will enable us to significantly improve the quality of our human capital. By 2016, spending on education will reach 5% of GDP. Across the country, we will build 400 new schools. There will be 350 new healthcare facilities. By 2020, the population will be close to 18 million and the life expectancy of Kazakhstanis will increase to 72 years. We will build 6 million square meters of housing each year. Across the entire country, new schools, hospitals, stadiums, and housing facilities are under construction. Since 2010 in Astana, Nazarbayev University has been successfully operating. It is the largest science and education complex in Central Asia.</p><div class="quote">“Accelerated industrialization is a step forward; one of the main thoroughfares of Kazakhstan's journey into the 21st century."</div><h4>What is your vision for Kazakhstan's future?</h4><p>We are living in exciting times, when the distance between the most audacious ideas and objective reality is shrinking at an incredible speed. It almost seems like yesterday that there was no sovereign Kazakhstan. And yet, in December 2011, the Republic will celebrate 20 years of independence. We started to create a country from scratch, and have never been afraid to set ourselves the most ambitious objectives. Over the years, we have built a prosperous nation and a dynamic economy. Kazakhstan enjoys the respect of the international community. The prosperity of our citizens is growing. Our young capital, Astana, has become one of the most beautiful cities in Eurasia. In 1997, we adopted the Kazakhstan Development Strategy for 2030, and since then we have consistently been achieving the objectives set down in this strategy. Our strategic priority is to diversify the economy. Within five years the share of the manufacturing sector in the structure of the country's GDP will be no less than 12.5%. The share of non-oil exports will increase to 40%. Labor productivity will increase by a factor of 1.5 in manufacturing, and by a factor of two in agriculture. We will carry out a fundamental modernization of the economy. We have all the necessary natural, infrastructural and, most importantly, human resources to achieve this. In Kazakhstan the new generation born since independence has grown up. Our successes and achievements are helping to raise the self-confidence, desire for change, new victories, and achievements of Kazakhstan's youth. Our youth are ready to continue the great cause of building a prosperous Kazakhstan.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2011</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Kazatomprom's vision in developing a more value-added chain in uranium and other rare earth materials production?</h4><p>Kazatomprom is successfully implementing the strategic objective of creating a vertically integrated company active at all levels of the nuclear fuel cycle to produce export-oriented products with the highest value-added. This we are seeking to accomplish through partnerships with leading companies operating in this field, which can bring their experience, expertise, and technology to the table to enhance Kazakhstan's advancements toward its goal. First of all, we are striving to gain a foothold in all phases of the nuclear fuel cycle, and one of the priorities is the construction of nuclear power plants. Kazatomprom is pursuing this target through multiple mechanisms including an alliance with Toshiba and Westinghouse, close cooperation with AREVA, and the planned creation of an alliance with Russia's Rosatom in the form of a joint uranium company. There is also an agreement, once implemented, that will allow us to benefit from commercial services for uranium enrichment and the fabrication of fuel assemblies, which constitutes the final product in the nuclear industry. It should be noted that Kazatomprom, as a shareholder in the International Uranium Enrichment Center (IUEC) and Uranium Enrichment Center (UEC), gets access to Russian centrifuges, which are the most cost-effective technology for the separation of uranium isotopes, having become a part of the uranium enrichment market. We also intend to participate in the construction of nuclear power plants abroad, in particular directly through ventures with China. The decision to build a conversion plant with Cameco will be finalized in 2012. By the end of 2011 we are going to complete the creation of a joint venture with Rosatom to enrich uranium at Rosatom's processing plant in Novouralsk. In 2009, during the official visit of French President Sarkozy to Kazakhstan, we signed an agreement on establishing a joint company called IFASTAR. This agreement is yet another fruitful result of the structural and long-term ties Kazatomprom and AREVA enjoy, and for us it is another milestone in the creation of a vertically integrated company that manufactures products with the highest value-added. A feasibility study of the project is complete. In 2010 Kazatomprom launched new high-tech projects, particularly those involving the establishment of the country's science-intensive industries for rare earth metals. In Spring 2010, Kazatomprom and Japan's Sumitomo Corporation signed the founding documents for the Summit Atom Rare Earth Company (SARECO) in the field of rare earth materials. The purpose of this joint venture is to create a vertically integrated company for the production of rare earth products with high value-added. The company has also signed a protocol of intent on cooperation in the field of rare metals with Toshiba Corporation.</p><h4>How do you see Kazakhstan championing renewable energy in the coming years?</h4><p>Kazatomprom is implementing several projects in the field of alternative and renewable energy due to Kazakhstan's ample resources in the wind and solar areas, and stocks of high-purity raw silicon. Building wind turbines is a part of the development of alternative energy in Kazakhstan and is currently undertaken at Kazatomprom. Their incorporation into the country's energy balance is also included in the accelerated industrial innovative development program. Our subsidiary Ekoenergomash is in charge of the project. We plan to organize the mass production of wind turbines in Kazatomprom's Mashzavod production facility in Oskemen. In addition to the domestic power market we are looking into the export opportunities of Kazakhstan's green energy through cooperation with current and possible future partners like Russia and China. Additionally, in early 2011 we started the “Solar Astana" project, under which we plan to launch the production of photovoltaic (PV) modules from Kazakhstani silicon. We will build two of the most modern plants. While the preparation of raw materials such as upgrading metallurgical silicon to solar grade will be carried out in a plant in Oskemen, the production of solar panels will take place in Astana. We have developed a feasibility study of the project, according to which the production capacity is extrapolated at 14 MW for the first year, and 50 MW for the following years. The project is planned to run into late 2012.</p><div class="quote">“Kazatomprom is successfully implementing the strategic objective of creating a vertically integrated company."</div><h4>How do Kazatomprom's industrial advancements, such as high-tech tantalum and beryllium production, fit into industrial diversification efforts?</h4><p>Kazatomprom has advanced technology and extensive experience in the production of tantalum and beryllium products. Kazatomprom's Ulba Metallurgical Plant has a complete production cycle from processing the raw materials to the finished products of beryllium, tantalum, and niobium. Currently, our Ulba plant satisfies about 12% of world demand in tantalum and niobium and about one-third of the world's demand for beryllium. We are going to manufacture high value-added end-products for the needs of the electronics, aerospace, and automotive industries. We are particularly looking to establish the production of superconducting materials for magnets. Now, we are working on a modernization program for our current production cycles.</p><h4>What business opportunities do you see for local and foreign investors in uranium and other rare-earth element production-related fields?</h4><p>Kazatomprom is interested in partners and co-investors that will bring their strength to the world uranium market and that will move us to the further stages of the nuclear fuel cycle, in which Kazakhstan is not yet present, such as conversion, enrichment, and the fabrication of fuel assemblies. We are ready to cooperate with the suppliers and consumers of uranium. However, to participate in the development of mineral resources of Kazakhstan, foreign partners must provide our country access to new markets and technologies comparable to the projects' economic parameters. The company already is working under these terms.</p><h4>What is your strategic vision for 2012 and beyond?</h4><p>Kazatomprom's strategic objective is to be the leading global supplier of uranium for the next decade and to create a vertically integrated corporation with a full nuclear fuel cycle. There is a real opportunity to increase our annual uranium production to 25,000 tons, or even more. We can also provide investment for the development of new facilities and are technically ready to increase annual production to 25,000 tons should the market demand so. We are confident that the returns on investment will be high.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2011</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Kazakhstan has inherited an extensive space legacy from the Soviet Union. How has Kazakhstan's government sought to maintain and upgrade the industry's infrastructure?</h4><p>Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Kazakhstan inherited the Baikonur Cosmodrome. Although this facility is located in Kazakhstan, the country can neither maintain nor develop it alone. The operation and development of the cosmodrome is carried out in cooperation with Russia according to two key agreements. The first one, dated March 28, 1994, was signed between the two countries to lay out the basic principles and conditions of use for Baikonur. The second agreement dates back to December 10, 1994, and was signed to lease the complex to the Russian Federation for a period of 20 years until 2014, with a possible extension of the lease term by 10 years until 2024. The initiative to extend the term of the lease until 2050 has come from the Russian side as the country annually invests tens of millions of dollars in infrastructure development and maintenance of the cosmodrome. The Russian Federation intends to continue to invest in the maintenance and development of Baikonur. In this regard, our countries have agreed to work together to ensure the continued effective use of the cosmodrome in the interests of Russia and Kazakhstan through the implementation of international cooperation programs.</p><h4>Kazakhstan has adopted a very comprehensive space program. How would you assess the significance of this program for the country's quest to become more developed?</h4><p>Provided Kazakhstan's vast territory and rich resources, space is an area of geopolitical, economic, scientific, and practical interest. Without involvement in space activities, it is extremely difficult to create a common information space, to study and rationally use natural resources, or to conduct environmental monitoring in our country. President Nursultan Nazarbayev has always devoted special attention to the country's space activities, and provides great support. The President has set the task of developing and implementing a phased, long-term program for the creation and development of the space industry. In this regard, for the further development of space activities, KazCosmos designed a sectoral program for the development of space activities for 2010-2014 that aims to create a fully fledged space industry as a high-tech sector that contributes to the acceleration of industrial innovative development in the republic, strengthening national security and defense. In accordance with the industrial program, KazCosmos was set the task of creating and developing our space infrastructure, developing a scientific and technological base, as well as ensuring the right human resources and international cooperation. For the creation of targeted space systems and technologies, the following projects are being undertaken: the creation and launch of a series of communications and broadcasting KazSat satellites, the creation of an Earth remote-sensing space system, the creation of a high-precision satellite navigation system, the creation of an assembly, integration and testing complex for spacecraft, and the development of the national space monitoring system.</p><div class="quote">“Space is an area of geopolitical, economic, scientific, and practical interest."</div><h4>Kazakhstan started the construction of its space center in Astana in 2010. What is the status of construction at the moment?</h4><p>President Nursultan Nazarbayev's visit to France in June 2008 provided strong impetus to the selection of a strategic partner to create projects and promote the use of remote space sensing as well as an assembly and test facility for space vehicles. The assembly, integration and testing complex for spacecraft will create a high-tech enterprise specializing in space technology components and payload elements. This is the only enterprise of its kind in the CIS. During President Nazarbayev's visit to France in October 2010, Kazakhstan signed two contracts with EADS-Astrium, a strategic partner that Kazakhstan will collaborate with in the supply and installation of test sites and services to support the design and construction of spacecraft. For this purpose a joint Kazakhstan-French enterprise “Ghalam" was established. The joint venture will focus on the execution of domestic and international orders for satellites, and will provide the assembly and testing of spacecraft for purposes such as communications, broadcasting, and remote sensing data. In accordance with the founding documents, the contribution of EADS-Astrium in the authorized capital of the joint venture will be 27.5% of the total amount. Also, EADS-Astrium will place orders worth ‚¬60 million. The future National Space Center will be located on the left bank near the racetrack in Astana on an area of 30 hectares, and it will house production, research, administrative, and social complexes in addition to a museum and planetarium.</p><h4>How can KazCosmos' activities in establishing high-accuracy satellite systems contribute not only to space research but also to a better understanding of Kazakhstan's geography and utilization of its natural resources?</h4><p>Another project concerns the creation of a high-precision satellite navigation system. Such a satellite-navigation system has a strong potential to encourage development in Kazakhstan and can find its application in many areas of human activity. The main consumers of this technology will be the Land Management Agency of Kazakhstan in the fields of geodesy and cartography, and the Ministry of Transport and Communications in increasing the safety and efficiency of vessel traffic, transit traffic, sea transportation, and traffic management. Additionally, the Ministry will see benefits in developing communication systems to ensure safety in the areas of airborne tracking systems, the carriage of hazardous goods, and in construction management. The Ministry of Agriculture will also see benefits.</p><h4>How does multilateral cooperation benefit your activities? What does each of Kazakhstan's space partners bring to the table?</h4><p>KazCosmos is actively developing international cooperation with foreign countries and international organizations for the efficient development of its space activities, and is attracting world-class technologies. This will allow Kazakhstan to create a space industry and begin to use space science, engineering, and technology for economic development, safety, and the welfare of its citizens as quickly and effectively as possible. Kazakhstan's main strategic partner is Russia, and two partners cooperate on joint space projects at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. In 2009, a strategic partnership with France was established in the field of space activities. On the basis of an intergovernmental agreement, national company “Kazakhstan Gharysh Sapary" and EADS-Astrium are actively cooperating on two major projects: the creation of a space system for the remote sensing of the territory of Kazakhstan, and the establishment of an assembly and testing facility for spacecraft in Astana. Kazakhstan has signed international cooperation agreements for the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes with the governments and space agencies of Russia, Ukraine, France, Israel, Germany, India, China, Japan, and South Korea. We have conducted meetings and negotiations with potential partners from Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Thailand, with whom relevant agreements were signed. At the present time, KazCosmos is in talks with the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). In addition, KazCosmos is continuing the development of a satellite technology megaproject. The activities of KazCosmos within the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space will also continue, as well as cooperation within the CIS and other international organizations. An important factor in the development of national space activities and the participation of Kazakhstan in international space cooperation is the access of the country to the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR). Kazakhstan has met all the requirements of the MTCR to accede to international treaties on the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and has adopted a package of regulations to ensure the effective export control of missile systems, components, and technologies. Currently, work is continuing in this direction.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have your operations evolved in the region?</h4><p>HeidelbergCement is the global market leader in aggregates and a prominent player in the fields of cement, concrete, and other downstream activities, making it one of the world's largest manufacturers of building materials. The company employs some 54,000 people at 2,500 locations in more than 40 countries. The HeidelbergCement Group is present in Russia with three plants, and has plans to expand its operations in this part of the world. We have operations in Georgia and Ukraine as well. HeidelbergCement's network really gives a clue as to the importance we attach to the Central Asian region. As for Kazakhstan, HeidelbergCement has been interested in this part of the world and in 2005 it began discussions with the Bukhtarma Cement Company in the northeast of the country. Following negotiations at the end of the same year, HeidelbergCement decided to buy the company out, and since 2006 we have been operating the facility. In 2007 we started to develop our other business lines. At the moment, in addition to the Bukhtarma plant, we have five ready-mixed concrete plants in four locations: Almaty, Aktau, Astana, and Shetpe, and one aggregate quarry near Astana. HeidelbergCement is also investing heavily in West Kazakhstan. In Shetpe, near Aktau, we are building a new cement plant. Our plans are that in 2013 we will start production at this modern, dry processing factory with a capacity up to 1 million tons of cement per year, and will build a second line when the demand is high enough. Our factory in the north is a wet process plant that we are planning to convert into a dry process plant as the future is in dry processing.</p><h4>How do you see Kazakhstan's cement production base and consumption channels developing?</h4><p>There are a lot of projects to be built and new capacity will soon be developed in Kazakhstan. The total production capacity in the whole cement industry in Kazakhstan is currently 8 million tons of cement, and it is anticipated to increase up to 12.6 million-13 million tons in the coming years. Current market demand we estimate at 6.2 million tons, and that is expected to increase to 6.7 million tons in 2012. We cannot forget that around Kazakhstan there are a lot of competitors pushing cement into the country from Uzbekistan and Russia. However, we have observed that imports are decreasing, and in 2011 they were 40% lower than in the previous year. In my opinion, this trend will continue. On the one hand, production capacity will increase competition, and on the other hand decrease the need to resort to imports. It is positive for the country to produce locally and sell domestically. In Kazakhstan the sector is typically driven by big infrastructure projects financed by the government. What this country needs is, in my opinion, more development from the private sector side, which we currently do not see much of, although the current trend looks set to continue.</p><div class="quote">“The total production capacity in the whole cement industry in Kazakhstan is currently 8 million tons of cement."</div><h4>As a company registered in Kazakhstan, how do you strike a balance between directives from head office and initiatives from the field here in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>Our head office gives us ideas, and we implement them according to our experience in the country. Innovation comes both from the field and head office. The Heidelberg Technology Center (HTC) supports our operations through its know-how and it is developing and providing us with technical assistance. Since 2006 we have spent millions of euros on modernization and environmental programs. We have added cement mills, silos, and Kazakhstan's first bag filters. In 2012 we are going to install the last filter, which will cost a few million euros. We also have ideas that we come up with here that you cannot create at head office. We are trying to implement a European culture of doing business in a market that was defined in the past by antiquated market development and economical principles. After implementing all these changes, our organization in this country should also be led and managed by locals. We have standards that we are strict about, yet at the same time we are very flexible and close to the business here. We take decisions here in the field according to our corporate standards. We have the freedom, which helps our company to develop fast by taking quick decisions.</p><h4>What are the barriers to a higher level of FDI in the sector?</h4><p>Relative complications in the law and bureaucracy cause difficulties from time to time in areas such as licenses, visas, immigration procedures, and work permits. Apart from this, the long distances between population centers pose another difficulty. However, these are challenges that can be addressed over time, and Kazakhstan's government should work heavily on them. The country depends on the rail network because of the long distances between the markets. Without a well-organized rail network, it is hard to shift around goods. The majority of the equipment is unfortunately old, and is getting older; investment is needed. In the second half of 2011 we faced delays in the delivery of raw materials due to logistics problems in the infrastructure network, resulting in a temporary halt to production. Many companies used this moment and increased prices, which stunted our decision-making. At the end it was a fight to get wagon space. In 2012 the market will not be easy, either. As the Russian and the Kazakhstani markets grow, more volume and logistics will be needed to be able to handle the increased output. Recently, I observe that in Kazakhstan many infrastructure projects have being carried out to solve the logistic problems in this country. I see that there is a movement for development, but I would appreciate if more was invested in that area.</p><h4>How would you assess the latest trends in construction materials manufacturing?</h4><p>Most of the products unfortunately come from abroad. Almost everything is imported. In the past, Kazakhstan produced a lot of interesting things, and now these factories are closed. There are goods imported from China, Russia, and Europe in the market now. This is not the best development path. In my opinion Kazakhstan should also focus on developing its own production, and the Customs Union with Belarus and Russia opens up new possibilities. In the building materials industry, for example, cement is manufactured locally, but the majority of all other construction materials come from abroad. We can find European technology in Kazakhstan, but I do not see real Kazakhstani products. It is, however, difficult to develop products when faced with such strong international competition. The fastest way to develop our own industry is to invite investors to establish production facilities in Kazakhstan. HeidelbergCement is investing in Kazakhstan directly. We are employing local people, bringing in know-how, developing cement production, and paying taxes in the country. This is, in my opinion, the right model.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the banking sector's excess liquidity given it higher confidence in terms of financing needs?</h4><p>In all economies, the public sector is financed by the private sector. What is relevant is that the Lebanese financial sector, namely Lebanese banks, have substantially more means and potential than the local economy's needs. The banking sector's resources are around $110 billion, while the Lebanese economy and the public sector utilize only 59% of these resources, which give banks an excess of $40 billion to finance other demands. From this perspective, Lebanon is similar to Switzerland from two perspectives: first that we are able to finance any need of the local economy or the state, and second is the confidence in the banking sector as a result of these strong means. The difference, however, lies in the fact that Lebanon is not a regional player in terms of financing, but it is starting to be and some banks have initiated a regional presence through the opening of subsidiaries and branches. One example is BLC Bank, which has just acquired a subsidiary: USB Bank in Cyprus.</p><h4>How important was the acquisition of the majority stake in USB Bank in Cyprus for BLC's external growth strategy?</h4><p>When I took over, BLC Bank didn't have any subsidiaries outside of Lebanon. The Lebanese banks have much more to offer than the internal market's demand, which gives way to excess liquidity. The means presented by this excess, coupled with the professional banking know-how, paved the way for many local banks to look for alternatives outside Lebanon. After carefully studying the options for a year and a half, I chose Cyprus because I know the country and its market very well, and it is in Europe.</p><h4>Given that USB is a European bank, do you see possibilities to expand further into Europe?</h4><p>We definitely plan to expand internationally, and not necessarily limit our growth to Europe only. Nonetheless, our starting point is a European bank. With USB, it will become even easier to expand in Europe and maybe Russia, and I am already studying many projects from Cyprus. We currently own 95% of USB, a publicly listed bank. We have the means to fully own the bank; however, we intend to keep this structure to maintain the benefits of being a company listed on the stock exchange—specifically to call investors easily to contribute to new projects.</p><div class="quote">“Lebanese banks have much more to offer than the internal market's demand."</div><h4>BLC Bank has experienced a high growth rate in deposits. Where are these funds coming from?</h4><p>The majority of the deposits in the sector come from Lebanese residents and expatriates, making up to 80%, while 20% to 25% are from Arab depositors.</p><h4>After being appointed as Chairman of BLC in 2008 you increased the bank's loan portfolio. What is the bank's loan activity now?</h4><p>My objective was to have the same bond investment ratio as other Lebanese banks. I am happy to say that, at present, the bank's lending ratio to the state is similar to that of the market. We are constantly increasing our lending activity to the private sector at the retail and corporate levels. This does not mean that we will stop investing in Lebanese bonds, but when there is strong growth, you have to stabilize it by maintaining a healthy equilibrium between the public and private sector.</p><h4>How is BLC targeting the SME segment?</h4><p>We are actively working on increasing our SME portfolio. Over the past two years we have grown our exposure in this very important market segment substantially. Furthermore, for the purpose of continuing to strongly develop an exposure to SMEs, we have signed an agreement with IFC, which after having evaluated many local banks, has chosen BLC Bank to be the pilot bank for the methodology of growth of SME activities, due to the capabilities displayed and the bank's active involvement in this market.</p><h4>What competitive advantages do Lebanese banks hold?</h4><p>A highly qualified human resource pool as well as very developed professional banking know-how are the major advantages of the Lebanese market. These parameters make Lebanon a potential future financial hub in the region. We are only at the beginning and there is a very high level of competition from other markets that are already established hubs, but we are willing to go into this competition. From a micro approach, Lebanese banks will expand by taking along their local resources and know-how. This is not a state strategy, but rather a normal development given the above-mentioned parameters and the financial means due to the excess of liquidity. It also plays to the Lebanese advantage that there is general trust from regional investors in Lebanon's banks. I would like to reemphasize that the major advantage of Lebanese banks is that the banking sector is the most successful sector due to the high level of know-how among its very highly skilled personnel.</p><h4>In what sectors are you seeing an increase in lending?</h4><p>The biggest increase was seen in the real estate sector, where there was a palpable demand that led to an increase in prices by almost three fold. When there is such an increase in demand, be it from Lebanese residents, expatriates, or foreigners, there is automatically an increased demand in financing. The positive aspect in this is that Lebanese banks are not as involved in financing real estate projects as are US or European banks, whereby the Lebanese banking sector's participation represents only 23% of lending to the economy. This means that ours is a relatively safe market, and should we see a downturn in the real estate sector, it will not have as dramatic an impact on the economy and the banks as if we had financed 50% of the sector's needs. A second sector that has witnessed an increase in lending is tourism and its related segments, revealing the commercial nature of the Lebanese market. On the other hand, private-public projects (PPPs) will one day reach us, and fortunately, as mentioned above, the banks have the means to finance such projects. Currently, there is no single project ready to be discussed, but the need is there and we have the means for it. PPP will be a big growth area in the future and will definitely be a good approach. The most difficult step is to actually propose the project; the rest is easy as the structure is ready.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What lead to the creation of the Investment Development Authority of Lebanon (IDAL), and how did the development of Law 360 alter IDAL's functions?<br></h4><p>FDI has a direct impact on economies and the socio-economic development of any country. Since 1994 we have had a strong belief that an investment authority could help the economy of Lebanon, especially after the civil war. Lebanon was the first country in the region to establish an investment promotion agency—IDAL. The government established IDAL with a good level of responsibility and authority. At that time its aim was mainly to manage the relationship between the public and private sectors in a number of reconstruction projects. In 2001 all of the countries in the region began to compete to encourage investments in the knowledge that these funds can have a positive impact on the social welfare of their country by creating jobs, fighting poverty, and exchanging knowledge. In 2001, the cabinet enacted Investment Law 360. The objectives and responsibilities this law demanded altered the function of IDAL from the rules that guided it in 1994. The law gave IDAL the responsibility to encourage investment in the private sector and to provide potential investors with incentives related to targeted sectors.</p><h4>What main issues does IDAL deal with in terms of the investment community?</h4><p>The main mission of IDAL is to encourage investment through commercial agents, focusing on geographically developing areas that are split into three main economic zones. The coastal zone is part of Zone A, Most of Mount Lebanon Caza is represented as Zone B, and Zone C is the rural area including Bekaa and the north and south of the country, where there were high levels of concern about the lack of jobs. Secondly, IDAL has the mission of marketing and promoting Lebanese industrial products. In its first mission, as an Investment Promotion Agency (IPA), we have to provide all the needed fiscal, economic, and sociological information needed for an investor to develop a market study. We provide credible and updated information for investors, and we use many tools to deliver and gather this information. We have the authority to provide and propose to the government the needed steps and regulations to be adopted to improve the economic and investment situation in Lebanon. IDAL also provides a package deal scheme that grants an investor a broader range of incentives, fee reductions, and income tax exemptions for up to 10 years. We strive to provide after-care services for investors and to take care of all administrative issues related to the need of an investment project. We facilitate administrative procedures for potential investors through our one-stop-shop service so that they don't need to pass by any other authority or ministry.</p><div class="quote">“We strive to provide after-care services for investors and to take care of all administrative issues."</div><h4>What kinds of sectors is IDAL targeting for growth and increased investment?</h4><p>We are encouraging investment into target sectors including tourism, industry, agriculture, agro-industry, information technology, and media.</p><h4>What sorts of investors are taking an interest in Lebanon?</h4><p>We have designated three main categories of investor. The first category is the Lebanese population living domestically or abroad. This category is the simplest for us, and through various programs we encourage the Lebanese abroad to bring a part of their success abroad back to their home country. The second category is Arabs mainly from the Gulf area. The Arab population is known to have an affinity for Lebanon. This category may be our main target for investment, and we are currently seeing an increase in investor interest in that respect. The third category are the international companies that can depend on Lebanon in terms of its strategic location in the region and skilled human resources and use it as a hub for services to the Middle East. Every category is interested in specific target sectors. The Lebanese look more into industry and information technology, while Arabs look to invest in real estate projects and tourism. As for international companies, they look toward investing mainly in the service and ICT sectors.</p><h4>What investment success stories would you like to highlight?</h4><p>There are many successful investment projects that were mediated by IDAL. One example is the company Ericsson, and what they have done in the IT sector is superb. In the tourism sector the Four Seasons Hotel is, for example, currently employing around 350 Lebanese people. In the technology sector there are many skilled Lebanese workers ready for employment. A project to manufacture access control cards is a successful story in this domain. It is in fact the biggest factory of its type in the Middle East. Another large investor is NPPC, an international packaging house for agricultural products. These are only a few of the examples of companies looking for incentives and setting up their businesses in Lebanon.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2011</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has your diverse experience in both the public and private sectors shaped your current vision for Lebanon?<br></h4><p>If you go back eight months ago, the situation in Lebanon was somehow critical; the political tension among March 14 and March 8 supporters was getting to a point that could have jeopardized stability in the country. I was convinced that Lebanon needed a different way, a centrist way, which is the only way Lebanon can regain its stability in order to put it back on course to prosperity. The business world develops in you the entrepreneurial spirit, which trains you to dare and venture into untested territories. The political arena is more of a consensual playing field where you need to convince first before achieving your goals. Combining the entrepreneurial spirit with the “need-to-convince" attitude is quite challenging for me. Running the country needs a driving force, a catalyst, which is what the private sector would train you for. However, it also needs patience and convincing techniques.</p><h4>You have declared that your aim is national unity. What efforts is your administration taking to build consensus within Lebanon's partisan political landscape?</h4><p>I've always said that Lebanon is not a two-lane road where only the issues of the STL (Special Tribunal for Lebanon) and Hezbollah's arms are running. These are issues on which we don't have consensus for the time being. Lebanon is a 10- to 15-lane highway where we can keep on the left side both the STL and arms issues rolling; however, on the other lanes there are the issues where there could be consensus, such as, electricity, health care, education, social security, and the like, and this is what I plan to tackle first.</p><div class="quote">“We need to focus on growing the economy by encouraging investors to create jobs."</div><h4>What key targets are you seeking to meet so as to improve Lebanon's electricity generation capacity?</h4><p>In Lebanon, we currently have an average supply of 1,500 MW with an average demand of 2,100 MW, while peak demand in summer reaches 2,500 MW. It shouldn't be considered an achievement if we install additional capacity to fill the gap. This should have been done many years ago. My objective is to involve the private sector in order to be able to supply Lebanon's citizens with power 24/7 within 3 years.</p><h4>What steps do you feel should be taken to improve Lebanon's debt-to-GDP ratio?</h4><p>We need to grow our economy bigger. The civil war as well as the “from time to time" political instability has deterred Lebanon from growing its economy to where it should have been. A study was done showing that had we not had the war in Lebanon, our economy would have been three times what it is today, which would have reduced our debt-to-GDP ratio down to almost 55%. We need to focus on growing the economy by encouraging investors to create jobs, which would reduce immigration and keep more Lebanese at home. This, by default, would help grow the economy. One other issue we need to focus on is to run our budget in a more efficient way by containing costs more efficiently and allocating a larger part of our budget to capital expenditure, which would also be beneficial in growing the economy.</p><h4>How do you envision Lebanon's geopolitical role in the region and beyond?</h4><p>In terms of geopolitics, I've always believed that Lebanon should isolate itself from what is going on in the region. I'll do my best to build some sort of a Chinese wall between Lebanon and the rest of the region, meaning that we don't want to interfere in anybody's internal affairs so that no one interferes in ours. Lebanese geopolitics should be based on a zero conflict policy not only with our neighbors (such as the Turkish policy), but the whole world. Lebanon can't afford to jeopardize its relationship with any country in the world. Lebanon will always respect all international resolutions because we can't be selective about which resolution to abide by and which one to reject. In sum, our policy is: zero conflict with everybody, not only our neighbors.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2011</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the story behind Fransabank and its growth in Lebanon and overseas?<br></h4><p>Established since 1921 and listed first amongst banks in Lebanon, Fransabank today enjoys the ranking of a top-four leading Lebanese bank. The Group's banking and finance legacy dates back over more than nine decades of excellence supported by its very responsible role in the multi-dimensional development of the economies and communities it serves. The Group has succeeded in establishing, developing, and consolidating a competitive edge that earned it a leading position amongst the Lebanese banking community and the countries into which it expanded. Today, Fransabank Group has a consolidated presence in nine countries: Lebanon, France, Algeria, Syria, Sudan, Belarus, Libya, Cuba, and most recently in Cyprus and very soon in Iraq. The Group also ranks first in terms of local branch network with 107 branches strategically spread all over the country, providing the Lebanese community with all types of banking products and services to satisfy their personal and professional banking wants and needs. Fransabank Group has succeeded in positioning itself as a forward-looking, trustworthy, dynamic, innovative, creative, and socially responsible leading financial Group that has been providing top-notch financial services to its clients in particular, and to the banking industry at large, while always putting the client at the heart of all its activities. Fransabank Group offers its large clientele universal banking services and activities mainly through its main commercial bank, Fransabank SAL, and its local and foreign subsidiaries and associates.</p><h4>How were the bank's financials for 2010?</h4><p>The year 2010 carries a very special significance for Fransabank Group. It is on the eve of its 90th anniversary and marks at the same time another record performance year for the Group. In this context, it evidenced a strong profit growth track, with an increase of 39.84% in net profits, translated into $145.74 million in 2010, out of which $92.58 million are attributed to the mother company Fransabank SAL. This growth is mainly due to the Group's effective strategy at home and in selective regional and international markets, complemented by the Group's efficient management of its expenses exposure. Total assets reached $12.24 billion, growing by 13.24% relative to the end of 2009; customer deposits reached $10.08 billion, growing by 11.86% as compared to the same period of 2009, and the loans portfolio reached $3.14 billion, growing by 36% as compared to the same period of 2009. The cost-to-income ratio stood at 48.30% in 2010 as compared to 54.70% in 2009. Return on average equity (ROAE) and return on average assets (ROAA) stood at 13.27% and 1.26%, respectively. The capital adequacy ratio (CAR) stood at 12% as of end-2010, which is above the minimum CAR required by the Banque du Liban of 8%.</p><div class="quote">“The Lebanese banking sector has achieved a growth rate of about 12% in 2010."</div><h4>In what areas is Fransabank focusing on for its core revenue streams?</h4><p>Fransabank offers its clients a large basket of carefully developed and marketed products that ensure its clients a universal banking experience, whereby they can find at our one-stop shops all the banking and financial products and services needed. Our range of products and services includes retail, corporate, SME, investment, and private banking services in addition to a broad range of other financial services. During 2010 and the first quarter of 2011, a set of products and services were offered to our client base. Special attention has been given to SMEs as we created several SME products like the pioneering “agriculture loan" and the first of its kind “energy business loan" and the “commercial vehicle loan". Several new housing loan programs were also introduced to the market. Fransabank was the first to launch tailor-made housing loans for the displaced, for the Internal Security Forces, and for judges. This leads us to the Bank's continuous desire to maintain a sustainable and balanced partnership between the private and public sectors, which is clearly evidenced through such products and other customized offerings presented in 2010 and in 1Q 2011.</p><h4>How do you see the business environment currently in Lebanon, and how is that knowledge changing your overall market strategy?</h4><p>The Lebanese economy grew by approximately 7.1% in 2010, and this is in addition to the previous three years where Lebanon has grown an average of 24% over that period. The Lebanese banking sector has achieved a growth rate of about 12% in 2010. This reflects the rather sustainable level of customers and investor business activity during 2010. The current political internal instability coupled with the unprecedented events that our region is experiencing has created a slowdown in the Lebanese economy. Despite this, economic activity in April and May 2011 has witnessed some relative improvements, and we are all hoping for further improvement.</p><h4>What has been the level of growth in foreign-based assets?</h4><p>At Fransabank, and other than Lebanon, we have a consolidated presence in eight international markets: namely France (since 1984), Algeria (since 2006), Syria (since 2007), Sudan (since 2005), Belarus (since 2008), Libya (since 2008), Cuba, and most recently in Cyprus (since 2010). We are in the process of consolidating our presence in those countries and the results that have been achieved in 2010 are very promising and indicate a greater contribution by our international presence to our bottom line.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2011</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the Lebanese banking sector been able to transfer its success in the domestic market to the international sphere?<br></h4><p>The Lebanese banking system is no stranger to international competition, having had foreign and Arab banks in its midst since before the country's inception. This proved to be a valuable learning experience for Lebanon's domestic banks, an experience that was augmented by the lessons learnt operating under tough political, economic, and security conditions during the Lebanese civil war of 1975-1991, and which taught Lebanese banks the virtues of being cautious and conservative. After the end of the war, Lebanese banks did not stand still. They first developed their services to surpass those of strictly commercial banking to areas encompassing private investment and Islamic banking, in addition to asset management, brokerage, and insurance services. Secondly, they embarked a few years ago on a process of foreign expansion, especially in regional markets. Given the operating background and the increasing sophistication of Lebanese banks, this process proved to be highly successful, made easier by the fact that Lebanese banks could replicate the success they have had in their domestic market to nearby markets with similar culture and language. This certainly has been true of BLOM Bank, which is the leader in retail banking in Lebanon, and now is the number one bank in car loans in Jordan and is among the top retail banks in Syria and Egypt. BLOM Bank also has had tremendous success in asset management, having launched mutual funds in Lebanon, and then in Egypt and Jordan, and soon in Saudi Arabia. To note, BLOM Bank currently operates in 12 countries—Lebanon, Syria, Egypt, Jordan, the UAE, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, France, Switzerland, England, Cyprus, and Romania—providing universal banking services through more than 155 banking and financial units in these countries. Other Lebanese banks have had similar experiences. In that regard, the major banks in Lebanon have developed enough to not only be successful in the local market, but also to move their success to nearby markets.</p><h4>Do you think that Beirut is slowly re-evolving into a financial capital for the Middle East and Mediterranean region?</h4><p>It is difficult to go as far as to say that it is becoming a major financial capital right now, as certain security and stability issues remain. The banks have, yes, been successful in going abroad, and the system here has definitely proven to be strong and resilient, but challenges remain. When the political and security situation stabilizes, I believe Beirut can regain its role as a major center in the region.</p><div class="quote">“I think the line the BDL is taking is right, and it has to be conservative."</div><h4>What is your assessment of the policy settings of the Banque du Liban (BDL), which have been labeled as highly conservative?</h4><p>I think the line the BDL is taking is right, and it has to be conservative. It has kept the Lebanese banking system immune from the international financial crisis by prohibiting investments in complex, “highly rated", yet highly risky investments. It has also kept it well capitalized, liquid, and with little leverage. Although Lebanese banks operating abroad follow the regulations of their host countries' central banks, they have largely adopted the conservative strategies nurtured by BDL regulations, which proved very effective in sparing Lebanese banks the economic upheavals seen in places like the UAE and the current political upheavals in Syria and Egypt. BDL regulations have also enabled Lebanon to avoid a real estate bubble. This is because banks cannot provide credit above 60% of the value of a project, with 40% demanded from shareholders. At BLOM Bank we rarely provide more than 50%. This is to protect the bank from downturns and against becoming over-leveraged. To sum up, the prudence of BDL regulations put in place have really proven to be beneficial in protecting the banking system, and we are lucky to be operating within this environment. This banking management culture has really helped. In addition, there is a strong level of coordination between the BDL and the Association of Banks in Lebanon. Before regulations are issued, they are sent to the Association of Banks for review, and we can suggest changes. In addition to strong regulations from the BDL, we also undergo monitoring from the Banking Control Commission (BCC). Monitoring occurs onsite and offsite, and reports are also submitted. There are also regular high-level meetings between chairmen, general managers, and BCC officers regarding our strategies and plans.</p><h4>What levels of growth have been observed in the mortgage sector?</h4><p>Housing loans have grown considerably, increasing by 40% in 2010, and currently are close to $4 billion out of a total loan portfolio of $36.8 billion at Lebanese banks. The mortgage sector has been helped by BDL directives that exempt banks from keeping required reserves equal in amount to new loans extended in Lebanese Pounds (100% of required reserves in the case of subsidized loans, 60% otherwise). In fact, the exemption relates to all new loans extended to productive sectors in the economy (industry, agriculture, tourism, education, and the environment), not just housing—a policy that has helped credit provided to the private sector to increase by an average of more than 20% in the last two years.</p><h4>There has been an incredible amount of capital inflows over the last few years. What do you do with this excess liquidity?</h4><p>It is a way to encourage and grow the economy. For the past few years, there have been hardly any increases in government spending in Lebanon, since that would cause deficits to increase further and debts to spiral. In a way, the economy grew strongly over 2008-2010 at about 8% annually mostly because of increases in consumer and private investment spending powered by the available liquidity, unlike in other countries, where most of the growth came from fiscal stimulus.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2011</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Lebanese banking sector saw incredible growth in assets during tough times internationally. Which prudential policies do you think have been the most important over this period?<br></h4><p>If I had to nail it down to which policies were the most important, I would say that they were generally international policies. I think that the one that was strongest and which helped the economy the most was the decision to not deal in structured products—the central bank would not give approval to any banks for dealing in structured products. Of course, in light of what happened globally in 2008, it has further strengthened its policies in the area of corporate governance. It has always had corporate governance policies, but it has used this opportunity to enhance corporate governance principles, such as having enough independent non-executive directors on a board, having independent audit committees and risk committees and to be checked by independent board members, and having a majority of independent versus executive directors. All of these things have come up in the last two years, and to me they are positive developments.</p><h4>What role does Standard Chartered play as far as services are concerned?</h4><p>Standard Chartered has been present globally for more than 150 years. In the Middle East, where we have been for 90 years, we have a strong workforce of over 85,000 staff of 16 different nationalities in this region. We are also very committed to the region, and our brand promise is a very bold one. That speaks of our commitment to the place. Our commitment here and our competitive advantage is really a fact of combining international expertise and experience with local knowledge. It is about bringing that back to the local environment.</p><div class="quote">“We recognize that [Lebanon] is a very conservative banking sector."</div><h4>How do you work to attract clients?</h4><p>Our clients here in Lebanon are usually international business people who are well traveled and so know about Standard Chartered Bank, which saves me having to do too much of an explanation. They know us, such that when we visit clients or prospective clients they open their doors to us—we have a good reputation. It is local knowledge of the marketplace and of the industries they work in that makes us special. We provide a bridge for our clients to take their businesses overseas, especially where it matches the footprint of Standard Chartered's international presence: Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. We are present in 70 markets worldwide, and our vision is to be the best international bank in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East.</p><h4>What potential is there for growth in the SME segment?</h4><p>Lebanon is largely an SME market—around 90% of companies here are SMEs. Lebanon is made up of entrepreneurs, and this is reflected in the history of the country. For that reason, we are also an SME-orientated bank, and work to support SMEs. We have green environment programs, special reserve requirements, relief programs for lending to certain SME sectors, and so on. All of these are very powerful forms of assistance for SMEs.</p><h4>How is your wealth-management line of business progressing?</h4><p>It is progressing very well. We are very selective of what we can do and what we want to do here, and also we recognize that it is a very conservative banking sector with a very strong regulator. When it comes to wealth management, we need approval from the central bank for every product that we want to sell here. It is a good thing for the marketplace. We lead the way in terms of being able to know what products work, which comes from our international experience. In that respect, when we present something to the central bank, it is already a tried and tested product we are bringing to it. Of course, it also has to be a product that makes sense to the retail investors here. That is what works for wealth in terms of giving the right kinds of products to customers. We are not really product focused; we are more relationship focused.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2011</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did HSBC become the most widely represented international bank in the Middle East?<br></h4><p>HSBC has a long history in the Middle East because its roots go back to the 19th century. HSBC has been established in countries such as Kuwait, the UAE, and Bahrain since the 1940s. It then expanded into the Levant region, opening its doors in Lebanon in 1946. This long tenor in the country makes the bank quite unique. HSBC knows the country well, and has an established presence across the entire region.</p><h4>What is the perception of HSBC in the Lebanese market?</h4><p>It is a bank that has been here for a long time. Customers know that it is a stable bank and that is safe and secure. Also, it is a bank that can bring international creditability to its clients. I think the international profile of HSBC is something that is really important and makes it quite unique in the market.</p><div class="quote">“The advantage of HSBC is that it can bring best practices to this market."</div><h4>From what areas does HSBC in Lebanon gain its core revenue?</h4><p>We don't have one single core revenue stream; what we want as a bank is to have a diversified revenue stream, as a cyclical situation can be observed in terms of where the majority of our revenues come from. Currently, we offer a wide range of products in Lebanon and that includes corporate banking, retail banking, treasury, and private banking solutions.</p><h4>HSBC Lebanon carried out a sales campaign in the middle of 2011 offering low-interest home and car loans. What has been the reaction to this campaign?</h4><p>It was the first time that a bank in Lebanon carried out such a sales campaign, and I think it is quite important to inform our clients that HSBC is a retailer. We have had quite a lot of success with this campaign, and more and more people have discovered what HSBC has to offer. In that regard, it gives us an opportunity to see our clients benefit from a better rate, and gives access to new clients who otherwise may not have come to us. The sales campaign is not something that is new to HSBC, as it was introduced in the UK a few years ago and then in different countries, including the UAE, before it was introduced in Lebanon. We currently have a promotional home loan, allowing people to refinance their homes using loans at better rates than they had previously taken out.</p><h4>What is the strength of the Lebanese banking sector and what does it mean for an international company to do business here?</h4><p>Local banks are quite strong and there is a good level of liquidity. For us, as an international company, business is focused on connectivity and the difference we can make for our clients. We have some clients that come to meet us in markets abroad and we can help in the formulation of plans using our network. The advantage of HSBC is that it can bring best practices to this market and products that might otherwise not be developed for a market like Lebanon.</p><h4>At what stage is the development of online banking in Lebanon?</h4><p>In the age of digital banking, we have the size to develop a digital banking platform at the group level, meaning we can bring this kind of expertise and technical experience to all our Lebanese clients. We also offer corporate and retail solutions online, and this is positive for our clients. However, it is interesting to note that although internet penetration is high, not many use internet banking services. It is used by corporate and retail clients to a certain extent, but there are still a lot of actions that are performed manually, despite the presence of online alternatives. We believe there is an opportunity here for us as an international bank to bring in certain best practices in that regard, thus improving the efficiency of companies. This will also be advantageous for security and significantly reduce the risk of fraud, which is something our clients are concerned about.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2011</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is Lebanon's strategy for tackling financial crises different from other countries in the region?<br></h4><p>Lebanon's history has been characterized by long periods of political bickering and instabilities to which the Lebanese economy has successfully developed immunity. In fact, sustained remittances from Lebanese expatriates continue to serve as a lifeline to the economy, preventing it from collapsing in the event of unanticipated shocks. Lebanon's strategy for coping with financial crises revolves around the sustainable role of its central banking arm (the Banque du Liban) in strengthening the banking sector's resilience through prudent monetary policy and close supervision. Added to this are the conservative credit policies and strong capitalization levels of the banks, which together have so far succeeded in averting the spillover of any major financial crisis on Lebanon.</p><p>The live-tested resilience of Lebanon during the various phases of political unrest was the driver behind the attraction of remittances from Lebanese expatriates and capital inflows from international investors eyeing Lebanon as a destination for their investments, particularly during periods of turbulent regional markets. This is measured by increasing FDI levels, which have increased by 3.14% y-o-y to $4.96 billion in 2010, up from $4.80 billion in 2009, with capital inflows to Lebanon nearing $21 billion in 2009 and surpassing the $17 billion mark in 2010. Paradoxically, and when the international economy was suffering from the repercussions of the global financial crisis, the Lebanese economy recorded unprecedented real growth rates of 9.3% in 2008, 8.5% in 2009, and 7.5% in 2010 according to the latest IMF statistics.</p><div class="quote">“Lebanon paradoxically succeeded at maintaining unprecedented levels of capital inflows and FDI."</div><h4>What steps are being taken by the banking sector to jumpstart the economy and increase activity?</h4><p>The Banque du Liban and the Association of Banks in Lebanon (ABL) have continuously strived to foster the private sector's involvement in the economy on the back of its vital contribution to spurring economic growth. More particularly, the banking sector has been multiplying efforts to stimulate its activity and exploit the excess liquidity by engineering products and services designated for the various sectors of the economy, namely the agricultural, civic, and social sectors. In addition, the Banque du Liban has been proactive in promulgating laws and circulars aimed at promoting investments within and by the private sector. In this context, and in an attempt to address the high liquidity overhang at Lebanese banks, the central bank lowered the reserve requirements on LBP credit facilities by 60% during the 2009-2011 period, an aspect which helped fuel LBP lending at commercial banks to unprecedented levels.</p><h4>Is lending more focused on the private sector or the public sector? Which areas are in the most need?</h4><p>The Lebanese banking sector has undoubtedly played a major role in smoothing government public finances and alleviating external debt. Lebanese banks remain the major subscriber to Lebanese Eurobonds and other governmental instruments denominated in both domestic and foreign currencies. More recently, Lebanese banks shifted their lending strategy more in favor of the private sector, with the share of loans to the private sector reaching around 57% of the total lending portfolio as of the end of May 2011, and claims on the public sector eased to 43%. Central bank incentives for private sector borrowings include a range of subsidies that could attain 700 basis points on loans extended to the tourism, agricultural, industrial, handicrafts, and IT sectors. It is worth noting that subsidized loans reached $774.73 million in 2010, up from $543.68 million in 2009 and $163.52 million in 2003. In addition, we have seen in recent years new directives by the ABL and the Banque du Liban that foster the growth of SMEs in addition to more favorably weighing micro-financing given their important role in accentuating economic growth. This comes in light of the robust demand for private sector lending, the government's policy to curb the piling of the public debt burden, and international rating agencies' recommendations for the banking sector to reduce its exposure to the sovereign.</p><h4>Do you perceive the increase in capital inflows into the country as a sign of increased confidence?</h4><p>During times of a global recession, waning global investment activity, and squeezed liquidity levels, Lebanon paradoxically succeeded at maintaining unprecedented levels of capital inflows and FDI, which propelled real GDP growth way above regional and international levels. More particularly, capital inflows burgeoned from around $11 billion in 2007, to $16.1 billion in 2008, $20.6 billion in 2009, and $17 billion in 2010. Concurrently, the level of net FDI accelerated from $3.38 billion in 2007 to $4.33 billion in 2008, $4.80 billion in 2009, and $4.96 billion in 2010. Said rosy figures can be mainly attributed to the regained confidence in the economy during the aforementioned period added to the less distressed domestic political scene and the uninterrupted flow of remittances from the Lebanese diaspora living in the Gulf. The recent revolutionary changes in political regimes in the Arab region have obviously hampered Lebanon's prosperous economic realm, to a certain extent, until the recent formation of the new government in June 2011. These factors did not go unnoticed, with capital inflows shedding some $1.65 billion during the first tier of 2011 to $4.15 billion, down from $5.8 billion during the same period last year, and net foreign direct investments dipping by 60% y-o-y to some $1 billion in the first five months of 2011. Nevertheless, remittances from Lebanese expatriates, which constituted a substantial 22% ($8.2 billion) share of Lebanon's 2010 GDP, are expected to sustain healthy levels in the upcoming period, and thus dilute any unfavorable contraction in capital inflows.</p><h4>What does it mean for the Lebanese to be ahead of countries in the region for Basel III changes/compliance?</h4><p>The Lebanese banking sector has always been among the pioneers in implementing international norms, reinforcing as such the sector's image and credibility on the international scale. As for compliance with Basel III requirements, Lebanon and China were the first two countries in the world to start adopting the different phases of Basel III, which reiterates the Lebanese banking sector's robust adequacy and capitalization levels. This would unquestionably provide Lebanese banks with a capital buffer that shields them from the repercussions of unexpected shocks or alleged accusations that may put the sector's reputation at risk.</p><p>The Lebanese banking sector has at present a minimum tier one ratio of 7% (according to Basel III), with expectations to reach 10% in the few coming years, way ahead of the January 2019 deadline set by the Basel committee.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2011</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has your personal experience in Lebanon and the international marketplace helped Alfa contribute to the development of the local telecoms sector?<br></h4><p>Alfa's biggest contribution to the Lebanese telecoms sector in the last 18 months has been upgrading its infrastructure to the latest 3.5G mobile technology, which we expect to launch around at the end of 2011 to our subscribers. My international experience and exposure has given us the know-how that has enabled us as an organization to steadily move forward with 3.5G implementation in Lebanon and to show the Lebanese people that moving to the 3.5G era is the right path for the development of the telecommunications sector in Lebanon and the economy as a whole. Introducing 3.5G in Lebanon is a historical milestone that will give a big boost to our national economy, attract new investments, and spur economic growth.</p><h4>What data packages will be offered with the introduction of this network and are you pushing for an unlimited data package?</h4><p>I cannot say that we are pushing for an unlimited package due to the negative effects such offerings can have on networks capabilities. People tend to overuse unlimited offerings, which leads to an overload on the network, especially on the data side. Keeping in mind network capabilities, I believe we will not be able to offer unlimited packages in Lebanon. Hence, the offerings we will be launching will be limited bundles, but with a slightly high-data rollover per package.</p><div class="quote">“We want to start by driving the telecoms industry in Lebanon at the fastest possible pace."</div><h4>Alfa managed to increase its number of subscribers significantly in 2010. To what do you attribute this growth?</h4><p>The growth in Alfa subscribers was estimated at 22% y-o-y until June 2011, and came as a direct result of the reduced prices that were introduced in 2009—a 30% reduction was applied on both post-paid and pre-paid offers. Also, it was a direct consequence of the decision of the Ministry of Telecommunications to re-invest in the sector. The Alfa network is owned by the government, but is managed by Orascom Telecom Group, a leading private telecoms entity. Therefore, the decision of the Ministry to invest in the network and expand capacity went some way to quell the built-up demand that was out there in the market. Today, Alfa has a total subscriber base of around 1.5 million customers out of a total of 3.1 million mobile users, in a country of only 4.5 million. This means that the cellular penetration rate in Lebanon currently stands at around 75%, which is an acceptable rate but still lagging behind that of neighboring countries, where penetration rates are closer to 100%.</p><h4>How will you be focusing on cheaper plans, especially for pre-paid voice calling rates?</h4><p>The tariffs here in Lebanon are different between post-paid and pre-paid. Pre-paid offers are considered expensive when compared to other rates in the region, since we are talking about a minute rate of $0.40 per minute. Post-paid rates stand at around $0.13 per minute, which is slightly more expensive than in other countries, so on the post-paid side we are doing fine. However, on the pre-paid side, there was a need to review the prices. That's why there was a rate cut in 2009 that was followed in 2011 by the “Alfa Waffer" plan, meaning “Saving with Alfa" in Arabic. The “Waffer" plan was mainly targeting the low-end segment; i.e. people who tend to only receive calls and not make many outgoing calls. We have three packages in this plan depending on the budget of the customer. For $10 a month you can stay connected, receive unlimited calls, and make calls worth 30 minutes per month. For $15 you benefit from 60 minutes talking time and with $25 you receive 120 minutes. This represents around a 60% reduction on the amount you need to spend to stay connected. On the minute rate, depending on the package you choose, you get a discount ranging from 33% to 40%.</p><h4>How will the modernization of Lebanon's telecommunications network open up the sector to multinationals?</h4><p>Dubai is home to numerous multinational companies. One of the reasons for being based there is the ease of connectivity to the rest of the world. If Lebanon sees an improved situation and connectivity comes back to the country, there is no reason why people won't choose Lebanon. Introducing 3.5G will open this door, through facilitating starting new businesses in Lebanon and encouraging international and regional organizations to establish their head or regional offices in Beirut. We want to start by driving the telecoms industry in Lebanon at the fastest possible pace in order to bridge the gap we still have today between other countries in the region and beyond since telecoms is a horizontal growth engine that can positively impact many other sectors, such as health, education, and banking.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2011</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In terms of the 2012 budget, what steps is your Ministry planning to take to manage the deficit?<br></h4><p>We are hoping to present our budget to the government in September 2011. There is a lot of work being done, as the last budget was in 2005. All the over-expenditure of that time period will be settled and approved by the Lebanese parliament. For the budget itself we want to make plain that we will improve the ratio of our indebtedness to GDP. We are looking to improve, and therefore we will be strict on our expenditures, although we will have a heavy demand for investment in the energy, water, and transport sectors. We then need the private sector to follow up on these investments. Additionally, we are hoping to pass a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) law that will open the way for investment in infrastructure.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the PPP law?</h4><p>We want to invest in making sure we have a cheap source of energy, which is gas. Furthermore, it is important for us that Lebanon gains a regular supply. Therefore, the government will follow through on any investment that is needed in that field. As such, the generation of electricity will interest the private sector, as it is much more generation-focused. The Lebanese government will maintain ownership of the transmission of electricity, and so the investment in transmission will mostly be from the Lebanese government side. For roads, I know it is difficult maybe at this point to start a toll system, but it is something that we have to look at. It is important for us to solve many of our traffic problems—there are only three main roads leading out of Beirut and this is putting pressure on us. The cabinet has also confirmed that we need to begin improving the utilization of rail, especially in order to connect the north with the south of the country. It will help alleviate a lot of the transport problems.</p><div class="quote">“We are hoping to pass a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) law that will open the way for investment in infrastructure."</div><h4>What steps should be taken to make sure economic growth is equitable throughout the country?</h4><p>We have to integrate the remote areas more effectively into the capital Beirut by enhancing the communication and transportation infrastructure. In that regard, it is doubly important for us to develop the rail network. For example, being able to travel from Beirut to Tripoli in 45 minutes will be very important for Lebanese citizens. This will also open up Lebanon to investment as it will widen the scope for the placement of factories and so on.</p><h4>In your efforts to improve the debt-to-GDP ratio, how important is improving efficiencies on the revenue collection side?</h4><p>Improving efficiencies on the revenue collection side is very important as all people are concerned with it, although the expenditure side has to be seen at the end. There is a lot of work that has been started recently and will be carried out in that field. Some of the laws were not being enforced properly. However, we have taken a decision to decisively enforce all laws in this respect.</p><h4>How important is Lebanon's very robust financial system to you in terms of managing the deficit?</h4><p>We have to be prudent in everything we do, and it is important that we meet our debt obligations. We have honored all of our debts throughout our history. We have an excellent track record, and we hope to maintain it. We have never failed on any payment. If we need to expand our economy, then yes we need to borrow, but we have to do that prudently. We can service our debt, and we will be fine. Most importantly, we want to make sure that our ratio of debt to GDP is always decreasing.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2011</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe Lebanon's economic and financial role in the region?<br></h4><p>Lebanon plays a prominent role in the Middle East and Arab world, given its geographical position as a crossroads between East and West and at a strategic location on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea. Furthermore, Lebanon's free economic policy in addition to the various features of its banking sector have all contributed to granting Lebanon a leading role at the economic and financial levels in the region, particularly during the pre-war period. Nowadays, and after the reconstruction process and achieving stability and security, Lebanon has regained its regionally distinct role, which has had a positive impact on its economic growth, scoring thus between 8% and 9% over the past four years, in spite of persistent Israeli threats and the war of July 2006. In this context, I would like to underscore the role of Lebanese citizens in reinforcing Lebanon's position in the region, for the Lebanese are distinguished by their culture while remaining up-to-date with the latest technologies.</p><h4>In what key sectors would you like to see Lebanon place more emphasis on to develop the economy and provide jobs?</h4><p>Lebanon has always been a leading name in the world of trade and services in addition to its high standards in the fields of tourism, education, and health care. That is why we are always keen to develop these areas to maintain Lebanon's status. Moreover, other sectors such as industry and agriculture generate income for many citizens and provide numerous job opportunities for the Lebanese youth. We must not forget the importance of the Lebanese banking sector, which proved to be vital for the Lebanese economy after it demonstrated its capacity to withstand and overcome crises thanks to the financial and banking policies adopted by successive Lebanese governments and the Banque du Liban. Lebanon's banking resilience asserted itself during the recent global financial crisis when Lebanese financial and banking policy was considered a policy to be emulated by other countries. In fact, despite the political problems Lebanon faced, its economic sectors, especially the banking sector, maintained steady growth over the past years. Our primary concern has been to reduce the interdependence between the economic and the political sector for the Lebanese economy to gain more stability and develop its potential.</p><div class="quote">“Lebanon plays a prominent role in the Middle East and Arab world, given its geographical position as a crossroads."</div><h4>How does Lebanon maintain his capability to attract the foreign direct investment?</h4><p>During the past years, Lebanon constituted a safe haven for foreign investments. Investments in Lebanon posted an annual growth of 14% to 15% between 2003 and 2009; indeed, the value of investments neared $4.8 billion in 2010, particularly thanks to the economic and financial policies adopted in addition to the facilities granted to investors aimed at encouraging the latter to invest in Lebanon. Beyond a shadow of doubt, maintaining security and stability in Lebanon will strengthen its ability to attract foreign investment, especially given the recent political and security developments in many countries of the region.</p><h4>How does Lebanon's substantial diaspora contribute to the development of the Lebanese economy?</h4><p>The Lebanese diaspora has played a crucial role in Lebanon's economic development; it has been a fundamental pillar during all the periods the country has gone through because of the money transfers and their persistence in investing in Lebanon. As a matter of fact, money transfers issued by Lebanese expatriates exceeded $7 billion in 2009. This is a clear indicator of the Lebanese people's attachment to their motherland and their complete confidence in its future. Moreover, among the Lebanese diaspora are investors with an entrepreneurial spirit that constitute a continuous springboard effect for sustainable economic growth from a capital and knowledge transfer perspective. Therefore, it is a must that strong bonds are maintained and consolidated with the Lebanese diaspora. Hence my keenness to meet with members of the Lebanese diaspora, discuss with them about their problems and recommendations, and put their suggestions at the service of the nation.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the Lebanese economy in the medium term?</h4><p>Lebanon possesses an array of capabilities and competences that must be seized on to develop its economy. Furthermore, Lebanon has relatively abundant natural resources that can be utilized, like water, for example. Furthermore, studies underline the presence of oil and gas in Lebanon, and a law was passed regulating the exploration and investment in this richness. Lebanon's economic future is promising and we have many opportunities we can capitalize on, yet the most vital prerequisite remains maintaining security and stability in the country. Consequently, we have always sought to bring the opinions of various parties closer and uphold constructive dialogue among them, for that would serve our beloved country.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What services does Cedarcom Group provide to the Lebanese IT market?</h4><p>We operate the largest wireless broadband operator in Lebanon. We cater for three sectors of the market. The first is the multi-branch-office market, where we securely interconnect the branches of banks and other businesses. The other sector that we cater to is the residential market, where we offer mobile broadband wireless services via USB dongles, Wi-Fi routers, or similar means, and third we serve the enterprise sector's high-end internet needs. Basically, we cater for the whole data and internet eco-chain in Lebanon.</p><h4>How do you see the potential for progress in the Lebanese telecommunications sector?</h4><p>The potential is huge and leapfrogging from the slowest broadband country (current in 186th position) to a top-10 country can happen in less than a year. What Lebanon needs is to enforce fair competition among operators and give security to investors. With the current anti-competitive practices by state-owned operators and one-year renewable licenses to private operators, Lebanon is unlikely to see any serious investments or innovations led by the private sector. The Lebanese people have the financials, the knowledge, and the will. What is needed is a proper regulatory framework that implements fair competition between state and private operators.</p><div class="quote">“What Lebanon needs is to enforce fair competition among operators and give security to investors."</div><h4>How does your wireless network compare to that of your competitors?</h4><p>We've outgrown all our competitors. When we came to the market in 2004, our competitors controlled the market; prices were high and the service quality was barely acceptable. The largest operator controlled over 50% of the market, but today we're proudly the largest. Our strategy was eight times the speed at 80% of the price. We shook pricing and service quality and forced our competitors to re-invest in their outdated infrastructure. We had a very clear-cut strategy, and we executed it with passion and excellence. We invested in the right technology at the right time.</p><h4>What developments are underway as far as updating your network?</h4><p>We're currently planning to invest $15 million in a new network build out, yet some shareholders are very cautious and are concerned to take this step. Though it is the right step to take, it might not be welcomed by the Ministry because we will compete with the state-owned operators.</p><h4>What are the biggest issues you face in establishing a better level of competition and higher service standards in Lebanon?</h4><p>The government imposes direct and indirect taxes on private operators like us of up to 59%, while state-owned operators are exempt from paying such taxes. State operators are classified as Significant Market Powers (SMPs), and they have the tendency to subsidize the cost of broadband services through the profits generated by voice services. These factors make competition impossible. Even if we offer a faster, superior service vis-í -vis the state operators, the fact is that the state operators have high fiscal advantages and subsidies, and they are able to sell a service at a lower rate than our own. In this respect, how can we compete? The telecoms regulators impose restrictions on SMP operators in order to prohibit any fiscal imbalance, while subsidies led to the creation of “monopolies" in telecoms, and as we all know monopolies are a consumer's worst enemy. Unfortunately, the regulator in Lebanon is not playing its role to the fullest and the unfair competition is strengthening day by day.</p><h4>Why isn't the government imposing a more level playing field for all operators, whether public or private?</h4><p>The previous Minister of Telecommunications, Gibran Bassil, was savvy and aware of the threat of creating additional monopolies. He published the famous General Rules for Regulating Telecommunication Services in May 2009, which were totally oriented with the clear-cut objective of converting Lebanon into an information-based society. He advocated fairness in competition, proper licensing, and listing the state operators' shares on the Beirut Stock Exchange, among other things. Unfortunately, until now, these General Rules have not been implemented.</p><h4>What impact do you see 3G having on the country?</h4><p>The way things are going today, 3G will be a reason for joy amongst consumers in the short term, but will turn out to be a nightmare over the long term since the government will monopolize the telecoms sector leading to the exodus of the private sector. When this happens there will be no incentive for the monopoly to invest in a cash-cow business, as we saw in the past. Lebanon was once the innovator in adopting GSM services, but 15 years later we can barely make a call without the line dropping. Accordingly, services will deteriorate in no time, and the first to suffer will be the consumer with less than satisfactory and expensive services, whereas on a larger scale the economy will miss out on huge investment opportunities. Forcing the private sector out would mean the closure of 23 companies that employ over 1,000 people. This will have a big impact on the economy of a small country like Lebanon. There is no question that introducing 3G is a necessity for Lebanon; however, it should be accompanied by the appropriate licensing in line with Telecoms Law No. 431 and with the right set of regulations that encourage the private sector to invest on the grounds of fair competition. If this is accomplished, then all stakeholders, whether users, operators, or the government, will come out as winners ready to make e-Lebanon a reality.</p><h4>What is your hope for the future of broadband in Lebanon?</h4><p>We are calling for broadband to be a “human right" in Lebanon. We communicated that to the Prime Minister, to the Minister of Telecommunications and to the Telecoms Regulatory Authority. In countries such as Finland, Greece, and Spain, broadband has already been made a human right, and this is what we want for Lebanon. We live in a small country and giving access to a 20 Mbps connection within Lebanon is not farfetched.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2011</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Despite the global crisis, in 2010 your company saw a 6% increase in net sales over 2009. What steps did Kimberly-Clark take to achieve this result?<br></h4><p>We are a consumer products company and strongly depend on innovation. The main reason behind our good performance in 2010 was our robust innovation strategy. We have improved and streamlined the basic components of our disposable diapers, making them thinner and adjustable while not losing any functionality. We applied this practice to many of our different product lines. Also, Mexico performed well economically as a nation, and has bounced back from the difficulties it faced in 2009.</p><h4>Apart from benchmarking, what other procedures does Kimberly-Clark adopt to create competitive products?</h4><p>We principally focus our attention on R&amp;D. We have a big R&amp;D section that works on local initiatives and on coordinating and cooperating with Kimberly-Clark worldwide in order to bring the best ideas from markets all over the globe. In addition to this, benchmarking is fundamental for growth. Here in Mexico, Kimberly-Clark has one of the world's highest levels of productivity in making diapers. This shows that if you put high-tech together with the skilled Mexican labor force, you can achieve extraordinary results.</p><div class="quote">“Mexico as a production base is very good. The labor force is very capable."</div><h4>Kimberly-Clark has eight production plants in Mexico. How would you rate the country as a production base?</h4><p>Mexico as a production base is very good. The labor force is very capable. You can get quality and quantity production, as well as very good connections to the principal internal and external markets. In addition, Mexico is strategically positioned—the US represents the biggest existing consumer goods market, giving the country extra value in export activities.</p><h4>How would you appraise doing business in Mexico?</h4><p>We have to talk in comparative terms. From a comparative perspective, Mexico is improving very rapidly to become a much more attractive place to do business and a much easier environment to carry out procedures. Mexico was ranked 35th place in the last World Bank Doing Business report. Our main competitor, Brazil, is in 127th place. We also have a large number of free trade agreements with something like 43 countries. This means we face a lot of competition, which forces companies operating here to invest more and more money in innovation to create more suitable products for the market.</p><h4>What are the main challenges in running a business in Mexico?</h4><p>I think that the biggest issue here is how the country is branded internationally. There are a lot of very interesting things going on, but on the international stage Mexico is considered to be a dangerous and violent country. The security issue is important, and the whole country is working on institution building to keep this problem under control. We are working to create a different image for the country. I am part of a group called Imagen de Mexico, which is composed of different representatives from the public and private sector, coordinated by HE Gloria Guevara Manzo, the State Secretary of Tourism. Many advocates of the public sector participate in the group, including HE Bruno Ferrari Garcí­a de Alba, Minister of Economy, the President's Office, the Secretary of Foreign Relations and, from the private sector side, the Consejo Coordinador Empresarial, and the Mexican Business Council. We are working toward our goal by organizing conferences and seminars internationally to rebrand Mexico's image to tell the world about the interesting things that are taking in place in the country, and not just the violence. We want to tell people not to sell Mexico short.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2011</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Which business lines and services are contributing the most in terms of activity volumes to COMESA's operations?<br></h4><p>Our main business unit is related to mainly seismic acquisition onshore, although we have also performed jobs in transitional zones and offshore for PEMEX. At present, we represent 85% of the full seismic operation requirements for PEMEX. We have also participated in production and exploitation operations in all fields in Mexico. Actually, we are involved at present in all the main exploration projects and in seven of the 10 more important production projects for PEMEX. Concerning production projects, we are involved in deepwater operations and the Chicontepec, Ku-Maloob-Zaap, and Cantarell fields, providing technical assistance to define the basic concept and tailor engineering to build production facilities in these fields.</p><h4>What main technologies are you currently using in Mexico, and what impact do they have in the development of the exploration segment?</h4><p>We have a full crew equipped with state-of-the-art multi-component tools for seismic operations. We are the only Latin American company that has this kind of high-technology equipment. This technological level allows us to collaborate with PEMEX to acquire fresh multi-component seismic data on the main onshore oil fields in Mexico, working to define sweet spots and to increase the recovery factor of these fields. Also, with this new technology we are helping PEMEX to look again at old play areas to deal with reservoir heterogeneity, low gas saturation, and fracture patterns.</p><div class="quote">“The oil business—both upstream and downstream—is highly influenced by technology."</div><h4>What infrastructure and technology development are needed in Mexico in order to meet the needs of the oil and gas sector?</h4><p>The oil business—both upstream and downstream—is highly influenced by technology, and it is necessary to have enough educated, creative, and active people as well as research centers. In addition, as is common around the world, Mexico's growing population will demand additional energy to support the economy. In that respect, Mexico will also require new pipelines and increased capacity for refining and petrochemical activities. To address this issue, Mexico must improve oil-related networks, from government to manufacturing and services companies, as well as invest in people.</p><h4>How economically viable is having strong public participation in the energy sector?</h4><p>Every industry needs a continuous flow of investments, especially high-technology industries like the oil industry, to support its operations, and to expand its possibilities of development and its capabilities. PEMEX has the capacity in terms of future investments to provide the amount needed to keep production going at a very strong level. Additionally, PEMEX is implementing plans to explore huge amounts of resources mainly located in deepwater parts of the Gulf of Mexico. Exploration investments were less than required from 1980 to 2000. Since 2001 PEMEX has increased exploration investments. Now, positive results are visible, but PEMEX has a deep gap in exploration investment that must be filled in order to increase the pace and generate true value exploration. Reserves and important resources to be discovered will require higher levels in the near future.</p><h4>Is a lack of long-term investment planning considered to be the most relevant weakness in the future development of the energy sector?</h4><p>PEMEX develops plans for 15 years ahead. The history of the petroleum industry in Mexico began in 1904. Around 450 fields have been discovered in the country over the past century. In the last 30 years PEMEX has invested in 60 of them, and this is related to the level of investments that PEMEX, and the oil sector, can afford. To be able to provide sufficient levels of investment, Mexico and the oil sector need to promote fiscal reform to balance the importance of the high percentage of oil activities in government revenues and also promote private investment in the sector. Parallel to this, PEMEX must be able to reinvest a higher part of its revenues to expand its operations.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2011</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>AXA entered the Mexican market in 2008 following the acquisition of local operator ING Seguros. How has this boosted AXA's level of activity in Mexico?<br></h4><p>AXA Seguros acquired ING Seguros three years ago when it was experiencing significant financial difficulties. Despite the financial crisis, we are currently on track with our planned acquisition process. Taking that into account, we are on track in terms of market growth and profits. We also are on track in terms of customer satisfaction—we have an 89% customer satisfaction rate, and we are doing a great job in building our brand. We made $60 million in 2010, but we still have a lot to do. We plan to close 2011 around 15% up on 2010.</p><h4>At AXA Seguros, what is the percentage of Mexican employees over foreign employees?</h4><p>Out of our 4,200 employees in AXA Mexico, only 12 are expatriates, which represents 0.3%. We consider ourselves to be a Mexican company, and this is thanks to the professionalism of the Mexican labor force. It is very easy to find educated people in this country, in all sectors of the economy, thanks to the strong education system. We have to train people in the insurance market specifically because this market is not yet developed enough to produce highly skilled professionals. We are training Mexican people to develop their already high skills, focusing on the insurance sector. In addition, at AXA we believe in integration and we always try to get the best from the market. Just to give you an example, the number of Mexicans that are working for AXA in other countries is increasing due to the strong capabilities of the labor force here.</p><div class="quote">“You also have to remember that the middle class is growing fast and is asking for different products."</div><h4>What are the best potential lines for growth and profitability in Mexico over the medium term?</h4><p>I think Mexico represents a great opportunity for companies like AXA—the population of the country currently stands at more than 100 million and is growing. GDP per capita is one of the highest in South America, and it is the 13th largest economy in the world. Concerning the best potential business, 80% of small businesses are not insured, and so there's a big opportunity right there. You also have to remember that the middle class is growing fast and is asking for different products. The Mexican people are not used to having insurance, and so demand will surely grow at a strong rate in different fields.</p><h4>How would you assess the state of the life and non-life insurance sector in Mexico in comparison with other Latin American countries?</h4><p>Mexico is one of Latin America's least developed countries for insurance in terms of GDP. Just 1.9% is represented by insurance, while the same figure for Brazil is 2.4% and for Chile it is 3.5% of GDP. This figure for Mexico is extremely low, and one of the reasons is that car insurance is not mandatory. In addition, there is no insurance education, and there is a lack of accessibility to credit in Mexico. Insurance and credit availability are strongly related. If people don't have access to them, they can't pay for insurance.</p><h4>What regulatory changes would you suggest in order to improve the insurance environment in Mexico?</h4><p>The first one is to make car insurance mandatory, and as well as insurance for earthquakes and natural disasters. Some countries, like Romania for example, have made it mandatory. Here in Mexico there is a danger of earthquakes and hurricanes, and insurance for these potential natural catastrophes should be made compulsory. The second suggestion I have is to create tax incentives for private retirement funds, because the public ones will have problems in the future due to the rapid growth of the population.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2011</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the presence of Coca-Cola in Mexico?</h4><p>We operate with 12 bottlers, including Jugos del Valle, which is a joint venture set up three years ago when we bought the company. In total, these bottlers have 64 plants across Mexico and around 385 distribution centers, with 29,000 trucks. We serve about 1.4 million points of sale throughout the country. Our penetration rate in the Mexican market is fairly extensive, and because of that fact a lot of our business is in the traditional channels—even in small towns around the country. Concerning our labor force, we have 500 employees in our office, 93,000 at our bottlers, and 800,000 indirect employees.</p><h4>How significant is the Mexican market for Coca-Cola's overall global operations?</h4><p>The Mexican market is the second most important for Coca-Cola after the US, and it represents about 12% of worldwide volumes. In addition, Mexicans drink the most Coca-Cola portfolio products per capita in the world. In fact, we are the leader in the market in soft drinks, juice and juice drinks, and in teas. We are third in energy drinks and also third in water, as well as second in sports drinks. Performance has been very good for decades at Coca-Cola, and in many areas is considered as an example for other countries in terms of business practices.</p><div class="quote">“The Mexican market is the second most important for Coca-Cola after the US."</div><h4>How would you rate Mexico as a base of production?</h4><p>We have been doing business in Mexico for 85 years, and from our perspective it has always been a great market to operate in. There's a strong and educated workforce as well as a good level of quality managers. The infrastructure is very good in the country, and the distribution system is highly developed. It is also a great base for companies producing for export due to the country's location close to the US.</p><h4>What are the country's competitive economic advantages over other Latin American countries?</h4><p>Its proximity to the US and the fact that Mexico has coasts on the Pacific and Atlantic oceans are its main advantages. Secondly, macroeconomic policies over the last five years have been consistent. Inflation is under control and the government is working to maintain a predictable and sustainable growth rate. The environment for doing business and openness to new businesses is very comfortable, and the government is open to the participation of foreign companies and capital in the territory. The labor force is highly skilled, and there is a huge availability of raw materials. Mexico is not experiencing explosive growth like Brazil or China, but if you look at the country's economic performance from a historical perspective, you can see that growth has been strong and predictable over the years. These characteristics are a magnet for companies that would like to produce or operate in the country.</p><h4>Domestic demand is one of the engines of the Mexican economy. How do you see its performance changing in the long term?</h4><p>The internal market in Mexico includes more than 100 million people—with the average age standing at 27 years. Having a young population means that the workforce will benefit, while from a company point of view it represents a very good opportunity because domestic demand can sustain the growth path of every business. In that respect, over 99% of our production is destined for the domestic market.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2011</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>From which sectors does demand for your services come?</h4><p>Xerox has undergone many changes globally over the last year following the acquisition of Affiliated Computer Services (ACS), a company specializing in the outsourcing of business processes, for $6.5 billion. The corporation is growing, and Xerox Mexicana is displaying healthy growth. We traditionally employed just over 550 employees, but after the acquisition of ACS we now have more than 6,000 people in Mexico, which has converted us into an important employer. Xerox doesn't have such a presence in every country. Mexico is special because ACS infrastructure has been originally developed in order to outsource services to US customers. Now we can offer these successful and proven solutions to the Mexican market, using skilled Mexican workers, and we can take on projects of any size. Xerox was traditionally focused on technology and document management services. Now we have a full portfolio of services, and with this acquisition the revenues of Xerox globally have become more balanced, with a 50/50 split between technology and services. We see the services area as a major growth opportunity, and outsourcing solutions a big efficiency enabler for our customers. Our Regional IT outsourcing department based in Mexico, mostly in Monterrey, totals more than 1,000 people. The sectors from which we see the most demand in Mexico include insurance, finance, manufacturing, telecommunications, retail, and government. Why these? Because these sectors are extremely document intensive, and documents represent the lifeblood of these organizations. The government in particular is very document-oriented and leaves a lot to be desired in terms of the digitalization of information. We provide digital solutions for document creation, sharing, storage, indexing, and personalization—the whole lifecycle of the document. We are big in on-demand printing of paper documents, for example user manuals in the manufacturing sector, and also in the streamlining of document searches and access, as in insurance claims and banking and mortgage application processes. In the telecoms and financial sectors a lot of account statements are printed, and now we are talking about multimedia statements. With ACS we are able to provide outsourced call centers, human resource management, accounts receivable and payable, security, and transport solutions. This combination of Xerox technology and ACS´s know-how improve the efficiency of our customers' business and brings them important savings. This is why we are very upbeat about that. Many businesses in different industries are keen to outsource back-office areas of their work that are not at the core of their business, and Xerox now makes that possible.</p><h4>In terms of products, what is leading the way in sales?</h4><p>We will place more than 50,000 units in 2011. Our large production presses are the best in the industry, but of course we can only sell so many of those. Office machines make up the major part of the units we sell. The office multi-functional segment is probably the most interesting one. People still associate us with copying technology, but copiers as such have been disappearing for a number of years; they have been replaced by copier-printers, which are digital and enabled by scanning. Therefore, we sell fewer and fewer machines as just equipment, and more and more solutions such as managed print services and mobile print, which we pushed very hard in 2011. Our technology now allows us or our partners to monitor, diagnose, maintain, and repair machines remotely, and using this service I can guarantee our clients up to 30% savings in printing and maintenance costs. We also have unique technology offerings, such as a family of products using Xerox solid inks, in which no cartridges or supplies are consumed within the machine, leaving no waste. These machines print on a large range of substrates, and also have fewer moving parts so are very reliable technically. We now do not have any gaps in our product line, starting from A4 desktop printers and going up to commercially sized continuous feed printing presses.</p><div class="quote">“On the global level we only buy paper from sustainable sources."</div><h4>Xerox holds some 9,000 active patents, showing a strong dedication to innovation. What is your annual budget for R&amp;D?</h4><p>Normally it is 5% of revenue. It is a commitment we make year after year, crisis or no crisis. In fact, every week we file about 15 patents. We have excellent research centers, such as the famous PARC in Palo Alto, California, a center in Canada, and one in Grenoble, France. A lot of very interesting things are being developed there, because we are no longer only innovating in technology, but thanks to ACS's expertise we are also innovating in the areas of processes and services. We have begun putting anthropologists and ethnographers to work on streamlining processes and customer interactions using technology. A major part of our innovation is focused on sustainability. My educational background is in environmental protection, and I like working for Xerox because I feel confident in the company's commitment to sustainability.</p><h4>Speaking of the environment, you launched an environmentally friendly paper in Mexico in 2009. What is Xerox's commitment to Reforestation in Mexico?</h4><p>We provide a portion of our profit from sales of that paper to Reforestamos México, a reforestation program. On the global level we only buy paper from sustainable sources. Xerox is involved in a number of alliances promoting sustainability, and I consider this to be a serious responsibility. Xerox is able to demonstrate how technology can improve economic productivity by reducing waste, and has a vision of waste-free factories producing waste-free products that work in waste-free offices.</p><h4>What goals do you have in Mexico, and how significant is this market to Xerox's global operations?</h4><p>Mexico is as significant to Xerox globally as the Mexican economy is to the global economy. Our Mexican operation benefits from good business, marketing, and training support from the company globally. Xerox Mexico is often seen as a leader in launching new products and services in developing market operations; we were among the first to launch e-commerce, managed print services, and e-publishing. In the future we will really focus on two key things; one being services, especially developing the penetration of ACS offerings in the market, another being technology and the solutions this technology can enable, like managed print services or transactional-promotional printing. Xerox is increasingly developing these two sides of its business and positioning itself as a services-led and technology-driven company. We need to develop both sides in Mexico, and the market will benefit from this. I think we have raised the profile of the company in the past couple of years. People recognize us as a significant player in the market, and this has been enabled both by improvements in technology and also by revitalizing our organization. In 2012 we are celebrating the 50th anniversary of Xerox Mexicana, and we are doing it with great pride.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2011</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the main function of Infonavit?</h4><p>We are an autonomous institution in which the corporate governance includes equal representation from all stakeholders, including the labor, employer, and federal government sectors. We call ourselves a social mortgage lender, as we lend to acquire a house, to build it, or to remodel it, offering lower interest rates than the main market. We are the biggest mortgage institution in Mexico, and workers who are on the lowest incomes are our main clients. At present, we have 14 million affiliates and 5 million active credits; we approve 500,000 financed credits per year—approximately 10,000 credits per week—through a highly automated process. Today, 22% of Mexicans live in a dwelling financed by Infonavit.</p><h4>How would you assess the state of the housing sector in Mexico?</h4><p>The housing sector in Mexico is one of the most important in terms of the socioeconomic development of Mexican society. In the 1990s, there was a great deficit in the demand for new houses. For this reason, access to housing was below national and international standards. In the last 20 years, the sector has changed structurally. Institutions were created in order to establish mechanisms to regulate and to finance the correct development of the sector. In the beginning, the main challenge was to reduce the housing deficit, and the most important achievement was the number of credits extended. Nowadays, the deficit has been reduced and the focus has been rationalized toward contributing to improving the quality of life. The sector has evolved and is now focused on sustainable initiatives, the incorporation of green technologies, and the promotion of environmental awareness. It is also more affordable for families.</p><div class="quote">“I believe that the housing industry in Mexico has been very successful."</div><h4>What main challenges is the housing sector facing in regards to the increasing population?</h4><p>I believe that the housing industry in Mexico has been very successful. We have changed the landscape of the sector and revolutionized how Mexicans live. Toward the end of the 1990s, Mexico had a deficit of large dwellings, land issues, and a lack of services. Over the last 10 years Infonavit has offered 4.2 million credits and transformed the sector. Nowadays, the housing industry faces two main challenges. The first challenge is to improve the quality of life. Following 2007, Infonavit began to focus on welfare in order to promote initiatives to improve standards of living. Secondly, we face the challenge of attending to sectors of the population that are not already affiliated with Infonavit, or Fovissste, which looks after the needs of government workers. We have made important strides to incorporate private employees, but we cannot reach workers that are not working within the formal sector.</p><h4>House prices have increased by 5.5% in 2011 over the previous year. What is your expectation for prices in 2012?</h4><p>Over the last 10 years, house prices have grown above inflation, which is very reasonable in terms of speculative activity. In 2012, I believe that house prices will continue evolving; however, people will still have access to affordable housing. As part of the development of this industry, companies have begun to build houses that can be acquired by workers of lower incomes, with an average price of around Ps220,000 ($17,000). This has allowed the sector to avoid a bubble, and has controlled the purchasing power of the people.</p><h4>What is your outlook for housing finance over the next five years? Do you see the Mexican mortgage model being adapted abroad?</h4><p>The Mexican mortgage model has evolved successfully. In 1995, we experienced a crisis similar to the one being experienced around the world right now. This allowed us to prepare the sector and develop a suitable mortgage model. We have developed a plan of “social collections", whereby we help clients that face payment problems, offering them alternative solutions. Today, we have a Mexican model that has shown it is sustainable and we see our future in the international market. In 2010, Infonavit financed 475,000 credits, with a value of Ps150 billion ($11.5 billion). In 2011 we expect to surpass 500,000 credits, with a value of around Ps160 billion ($12.3 billion). It will be a good year. We see a prosperous future in the housing sector now immersed in the green idea, offering the best quality of life to all families.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2011</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How extensive is GM's production capacity in Mexico?</h4><p>Our production capacity in Mexico is 605,000 vehicles per year, 1.2 million engines, and around 1 million transmissions. We have four manufacturing complexes in the country, with different combinations of engine, foundry, assembly, stamping, and transmission plants. This organization is very flexible and allows us to maintain high levels of production on all of our lines. We continuously monitor market conditions to improve or grow production levels.</p><h4>What potential does Mexico hold as a production base?</h4><p>To rank the production base of a country several factors must be taken into consideration. These are principally (1) access to distribution centers, (2) government and community relations, and (3) market coverage. According to these factors, Mexico is in a good position. Nevertheless, there are some changes that I would like to see happening, but unfortunately they do not depend on GM but on the general environment where vehicles are being produced. We would like to see better distribution centers, and better infrastructure that can assist us in our operations. Mexico has the potential to become one of the most competitive countries in terms of manufacturing competitiveness, but it still needs some improvement.</p><div class="quote">“Mexico has the potential to become one of the most competitive countries in terms of manufacturing."</div><h4>How important is the automotive segment for the Mexican economy?</h4><p>Putting aside the oil and gas industry, the automotive industry is the primary driver of Mexico's economy. Its magnitude is critical in terms of employment generation, exports, creation of human wellbeing in society, and generation of taxes. The automotive industry is bringing technological innovation and the taxes positively benefit government revenues, which are then spent on improving living standards. The automotive sector is a big player in Mexico's economy and it will play this role for a long time, contributing even more to the welfare of the population and the economy.</p><h4>What main trends did you identify over the last few years in the automotive segment in Mexico?</h4><p>First of all, I have to say that the Mexican consumer is demanding and looking for the best alternatives, but is always concerned about the price and affordability of a product. The automotive industry in the country is moving to meet the needs of this price-conscious customer base, and it is producing vehicles in concert with the capability of consumers. In Mexico, basic transportation is one of the most important factors, and for this reason automotive producers are basically focused on this segment. Another trend is the growing concern over the use of fossil fuels and its impact to the environment. The industry is moving to adopt new technologies that can mitigate this concern. There is also an augmenting concern over security and safety, especially from a regulatory point of view.</p><h4>What will constitute the most effective actions that could improve the country's industrial performance?</h4><p>I believe that all participants in the automotive industry should align their agendas. The manufacturers, dealers, the government, and all components of the supply chain need to come together with common themes. This will ensure that we are speaking the same language. If we can improve the output and quality of the automotive industry, and make integrated efforts with the different levels of government in terms of regulations and incentives, as well as with suppliers and dealers, we will all participate in the generation of employment, conversion of the vehicle park, and in general, the improvement of the economy.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2011</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[canny-performance]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you rank the strength of Mexico's commercial banking system relative to the other Latin American countries in which Scotiabank is operating?</h4><p>I think the Mexican financial system is one of the most solid in the world, and it proved itself during the last financial crisis. The average capitalization rate for Mexican banks is above 16%. I think one of the things that allowed Mexico to be more solid today was the 1994 “Tequila Effect" crisis. The regulators and the banks learned their lessons and we didn't make the same mistakes again. Therefore, when this new crisis came around the banks all had very solid policies and very solid capitalization, and were thus very resilient to the crisis. Mexico's GDP dropped in 2009 by around 6.5%, which was one of the worst declines in GDP it had ever seen. Regardless, no bank was hurt in a significant way.</p><h4>Where does Mexico fit into Scotiabank's expansion plans?</h4><p>Mexico is one of the most important markets we have. We have not carried out an acquisition, as we haven't found the right strategic partner we need at the right price. We have, however, continued to invest organically and we have grown in Mexico in a very important way. Five years ago we had less than 200 branches, and now we have more than 700. We used to have less than 1 million customers, and now we are about to reach 3 million. We had less than 6,000 employees and now are near 12,000. Therefore, we have not had the luxury or the opportunity of carrying out any inorganic play in Mexico yet, but we have continued to invest and grow organically in a very important manner. Of course, if the right opportunity appears at the right price we'll go for it. Until then, we will continue with organic growth.</p><div class="quote">“If the right opportunity appears at the right price we'll go for it. Until then, we will continue with organic growth."</div><h4>How has your risk management analysis contributed to your strong performance?</h4><p>We are a bank that is known for being very conservative and very strong in risk management. It's in the DNA of this organization worldwide to be a very prudent risk taker, and that has helped us. Adding up delinquencies and write offs over the past years, we probably have one of the best performance rankings in the market depending on the product. We carry out basic banking, and attach great importance to understanding the customer and making sure the sale of today is not the problem of tomorrow.</p><h4>Mexico's current credit rating is considered stable by major rating agencies. How do you see this trend evolving in the future?</h4><p>I think it will remain at its current level or improve. I believe it is a very stable financial system, and Mexico has been on a very good route macro-economically. I don't anticipate any changes. We are entering an election year, but I believe no matter who wins that the macro-economic basics will remain. That's very important because if you look at Mexico 30 years ago we were always nervous about the new government. Now all the parties respect and understand the importance of having a reasonable deficit and having healthy public finances.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the corporate market in Mexico and which sector is currently attracting the most favorable financing?</h4><p>From a broad perspective I think that the capital markets are still very young and very green. There is still a lot of opportunity to grow. We should have more companies publicly traded. The framework is there, but it is a question of culture. Mexico still has a lot of family-owned companies that don't see the advantage to being publicly traded. Companies are motivated to be publicly traded when they see a clear advantage in obtaining funds from the public rather than the banks. However, the rates are so low right now there is not a lot of incentive to do that. If you decide to be publicly traded the framework is there, but you need to comply with a lot of things from a corporate government perspective. Why would you do that if you still have funds available at a cheaper price?</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2011</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[always-prepared]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As voice technology gives way to data, how is América Móvil adjusting to worldwide trends toward mobile computing?</h4><p>Voice is moving to data. We are investing a lot of money in data networks and content. Our approach is three pronged: voice, data, and broadband video. We are thus creating networks capable of providing all three at once. It is a huge investment for América Móvil to be making in Latin America. In that respect, América Móvil is the leading investor in the region. Our investment is focused not only on the big cities, but also on small towns in order to provide not only voice but data services as well. Moreover, I believe that data changes are going to change the world. Your cell phone will be your computer, without the limitations of current smart phones. This will open up the sector to all kinds of changes, such as our Banca Móvil service, which allows the user to perform e-banking on the move.</p><h4>How has your acquisition of Telmex changed your operations?</h4><p>We acquired 61% of Telmex around one year ago, and are making an offer to buy the remaining shares. Technology is becoming more convergent, and so it made sense for us to acquire Telmex. This has been a strategy we have employed across Latin America, and it has been very successful.</p><div class="quote">“Our approach is three pronged: voice, data, and broadband video."</div><h4>What factors allowed América Móvil to remain resilient over the course of the global economic crisis?</h4><p>There have been difficult years and I think there are more to come, but we are ready. We make sound investments and operate with the best technology, and this allows us to remain competitive in the market. The data segment is growing, and there is still a lot of room to grow there. This will drive growth no matter what. Only 10% of our wireless subscribers have a smart phone. We want 50% to 60% or more to have a smart phone, and then use data. There is still a lot of work to do to move more and more people onto using data. To achieve this goal a large network is necessary and the right investments must be made. Except for Mexico and Argentina we provide all services, including wireless and fixed broadband and satellite and cable TV across our operations in Latin America.</p><h4>What has been the net impact of your international pact with Vodafone in 2005?</h4><p>This was a positive deal as Vodafone is a world-class company. In the markets where it is not present, we are present, and vice versa. This pact more or less provides roaming possibilities. We also share some corporate customers.</p><h4>How significant is Mexico to América Móvil's overall operations?</h4><p>We are growing more in the rest of Latin America than in Mexico at the moment. We operate in a total of 18 countries, and most markets are growing at a faster rate than Mexico. Brazil is currently showing strong growth.</p><h4>How do you see the company growing in Latin America?</h4><p>The current mobile penetration rate is around 80% in Mexico, so there is room to grow on that front. We are present in almost every country, and so we expect a lot of organic growth. There is one more acquisition pending in El Salvador, but other than that no large acquisitions will be made. The rest of the growth is going to be mostly organic. We also provide internet in Brazil. It's a cable company. We hold 92% of the company, and will possibly buy the rest. On top of that, we will continue investing in the networks of the countries we are already present in.</p><h4>How do you see TV and broadband penetration changing?</h4><p>Telmex does not have a license to provide television services; however, if it did we believe penetration would increase as a result of competition. A lot of firms are investing in broadband, and as computers come down in price the penetration rate will increase. iPads will also increase the penetration rate of wireless broadband. Through Telmex we sell computers and provide comfortable payment options, and this is helping to increase the penetration rate, as it is currently low.</p><h4>What is your forecast for the Mexican economy, and what does it signal for the future of América Móvil?</h4><p>These are tough times, as the US and Europe have both been affected by the global economic crisis. Latin America is in a much better position, but I predict we will also be affected by a slowdown in growth in Europe and the US. We need to be prepared for this. América Móvil doesn't hire too many people or increase costs when times are good as costs then need to be decreased when tough times are faced. Today, we are in good shape. We need to be prepared for the slowdown in Latin America, but I think we are still going to emerge in better shape than much of the world.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2011</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Volkswagen Group is shaping up to be the world's largest automotive producer. What factors have made this possible?</h4><p>Yes, you might say we are on our way to the top, but it's not so important to be number one in terms of volume. We want to be number one in quality and customer satisfaction. That is our goal. The best way to maintain a stable client base and to attract new customers is to offer the best quality product and the best service. Another reason why the VW Group is so successful is our range of car brands, including Audi, Bentley, Bugatti, Lamborghini, Volkswagen, Skoda, and SEAT. Even belonging to the same group, each brand has its own philosophy and its own place in the market.</p><h4>What steps has VW taken to make its Puebla plant the biggest in North America?</h4><p>We have been in Mexico for almost 50 years. We started with the classic Beetle, or the “Vocho," as they call it here. It was the right car at the right time for the country and the Mexican customer, and allowed us to build a strong presence in Mexico as a market participant and a manufacturer. Over time we added other models for the Mexican and export markets. Today, the manufacturing base in Mexico is a cornerstone for the North American strategy of the Group. The goal is to significantly increase our market presence in the US, with cars produced both in Mexico and in the US.</p><div class="quote">“Mexico is competitive cost-wise, and has a consolidated supply chain."</div><h4>What models are you producing in Mexico and what international markets are you currently serving?</h4><p>Our main market is the US, but our cars also go to South America, Europe, and Asia. The New Jetta represents more than half of our production in Puebla. Our second generation Beetle is the lifestyle car; it has special role promoting Volkswagen's image. For the Golf Variant, the main market is Europe. We also build the Clásico, a fourth-generation Jetta. The main market for this car is Mexico, and it is currently number one in the market here.</p><h4>What strategy is behind the construction of your new plant in Guanajuato?</h4><p>The Guanajuato plant is part of our North American regional strategy. It will supply state-of-the art engines to both our North American assembly plants, to support the increasing demand of the New Jetta, which we launched in 2010, and the New Passat, which is being built in Chattanooga.</p><h4>What strategic advantages does Mexico offer to VW, and what makes Mexico important to VW's global operations?</h4><p>Mexico has a major advantage over other countries. We can export duty free to South America, North America, Europe, and Japan. The Mexican free trade network makes this possible; it represents a competitive edge for Mexico, and has driven the growth of the auto industry. If you produce cars in Europe and want to sell them in the US or South America, it's not easy to be profitable. Mexico is also competitive cost-wise, and has a consolidated supply chain that has been growing during its 50 years of automotive production. Almost all major manufacturers are producing cars here and increasing their Mexican sourcing. If you want to comply with the rules of origin requirements that are part of the free trade agreements, the best way to do so is to maximize Mexican value-added. Your end product is a Mexican car that complies with rules of origin in the US, Europe, and South America, and the industrial infrastructure in Mexico supports this.</p><h4>What trends do you see in the automotive industry in Mexico and what expectations do you have for the coming years?</h4><p>I believe that growth will continue in Mexico, not only in our industry but in general. The local market here still has potential, provided enough jobs are created to increase purchasing power. One trend in the Mexican automotive industry over the past few years has been that the country is becoming the production center for compact and sub-compact cars for the US market; cars that were not even being offered in the US market before are now assembled in Mexico. Most of the major investments in the last couple of years have been related to these types of cars. And Volkswagen has always been strong in the compact segment.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2011</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Mexico accounts for the highest number of GE plants outside of the US. How does Mexico figure into GE's overall Latin American and global operations?</h4><p>We are the biggest manufacturing platform outside the US, with 21 manufacturing plants, including three new acquisitions. We also have eight service centers, 51 sites in total with offices around the country, almost 11,000 employees, and 35,000 with joint ventures, of which we have four very important ones in Mexico. In revenues, unfortunately, we've been losing our position. We used to be number one in Latin America, but Brazil has caught up with us and will surpass us in 2011. In 2010 we closed with total sales of $1.9 billion. However, 2011 is a tough call, but we should be growing in double digits. Revenues in Mexico come from GE Capital, which accounts for around 40%. This is a difference since in the past they represented more than 50% of revenue. We are focusing all our efforts to grow our industrial operations, while GE Capital will continue to be an important business.</p><h4>How will the introduction of “DuraStation" in partnership with GDF SUEZ lead to the utilization of electric cars in the Mexican market, and how will this new technology improve the electrical infrastructure in Mexico?</h4><p>We were the first company to set up electric vehicle charging stations in Latin America. That sends out a very positive signal, namely that of the utilization and development of clean energy. These DuraStationsTM will be partly loaded by solar power. We have the technology. We're already in the second generation of DuraStationTM; the new product is called WattstationTM. The new stations charge in four to eight hours, whereas in the previous stations a car had to be charged for 12-18 hours. With this technology you can remotely interact with the charging station via cell phone. You are also informed if your car is ever disconnected. Also, the price of electricity is very competitive, and cheaper than gasoline. The electric cars produced right now are not the lowest priced, because it's a new technology. However, once the market expands and the infrastructure is in place, prices will naturally come down. We have built 400 stations of this type in the US and have an order for 400 stations more, which puts us in the number one position. General Electric is a company founded by Thomas Edison, and we carry on that innovative tradition, applying the necessary research, development, design, and initiative to produce new technologies that will benefit all segments of the population and improve people's quality of life.</p><div class="quote">“We were the first company to set up electric vehicle charging stations in Latin America."</div><h4>Do you use mainly wind and solar, or does hydropower still play the dominant role?</h4><p>Gas is growing most rapidly now. That's a reality. The fact is fossil fuel use will not go away as rapidly as we might hope. However, renewables will be growing, and the government has set a target for renewable energy use.</p><h4>How does the acquisition of Lineage Power and Dresser fit within your plant-expansion strategy in Mexico?</h4><p>Lineage is about industrial solutions, and it complements some of our solutions for electrical installations. From Wood Group we only acquired the “Well Support" business. Dresser and Wood Group complement our portfolio in oil and gas. The acquisitions were made with a worldwide strategy in mind, not just limited to Mexico. These acquisitions now enable us to take care of the whole process from beginning to end for our customers. We can now do everything from extracting oil to distributing it, thanks to these companies. Lineage does that in the electrical sector. These companies have enabled us to achieve a fully integrated solution for our customers. That's the name of the game today. It's all about solutions. You have to provide a whole solution, not just a part of it.</p><h4>In your opinion, what are the main reasons why the Critikon plant won the award for best plant of GE Healthcare globally?</h4><p>Mexico has a very rich reservoir of talent—human talent. It's not about cheap labor or low costs anymore. It's about having a talented workforce. In the 1980s and 1990s it was about cheap labor, which is what brought about the existence of maquiladoras. However, Mexico is now at a different stage. We are now positioned as the top country in the global GE network in terms of environmental health and safety (EHS) practices, with our 21 manufacturing plants. We have very high standards, even higher than that which is required by law—and that has to do with talented people who can run a plant efficiently and lower the cost of manufacturing. It's all about performance and sustainability building rigor and operating systems along with innovation and contributing on a global basis, that mentality of continuous improvement on product performance superb customer service it's entrenched in Mexico's manufacturing culture, with our operating system we assure continuous seed planting for a bright and sustained future. The best plants have the best people and we make sure that people growth is always a top priority. Mexico produces about 90,000 engineering graduates a year, more than the US. We started tapping into that talent in the universities. We are doing the same thing in management. We find talented students in universities and even in high school. We have all types of learning programs, training centers, and so on. The company invests $1 billion per year in training worldwide. We see training as an investment, not a cost.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How significant is the Mexican market for Unilever's global operations?</h4><p>Unilever Mexico is among the 15 biggest Unilever operations in the world. If you take into consideration the fact that Unilever draws more than 50% of its global turnover from developing and emerging economies, then Mexico is extremely relevant for our business. Mexico has a lot of potential to grow. If you look at the Mexican consumer and where Mexico is located, we have all the preconditions to really grow very fast. That is the current thinking we have within Unilever.</p><h4>What performance are the different Unilever product lines experiencing in in 2011, and what can we expect in 2012?</h4><p>We have a very strong presence in the deodorants market, as well as in the food products market—soups, bouillon cubes, and ice cream. We run a very important operation in the shampoo segment, and occupy a good position in soya beverages as well. We are present in several categories and we never stop investing. We represent around 20 brands in total.</p><div class="quote">“Innovation is at the heart of our products. We need innovation to stay fresh, and to retain consumers."</div><h4>What are your main strategies to increase your market share in Mexico?</h4><p>Excellence at the point of sale is very important. We are a consumer and customer-centric organization. There are several formats of modern retail, from smaller markets to hypermarkets. Proper promotion policies must be in place and everything must run well on the logistics side to make sure the product is available to all consumers. Additionally, constant contact must be maintained with consumers in order to anticipate their needs and bring the highest levels of convenience to the market. Mexican consumers are very sophisticated. The regions of Mexico all vary differently from one another, and all consumers must be catered for across the entire value spectrum.</p><h4>How important is innovation and technology to Unilever's business model?</h4><p>Innovation is at the heart of our products. We need innovation to stay fresh, and to retain consumers. If you have a brand the target group of which is teenagers or young males, this is a volatile market. These people change their minds all the time, like their tastes in music and their tastes in food. You need to keep it fresh all the time. If you are looking at a more traditional brand, you need to do the same. Consumers are always looking for new things. Our innovation centers try to anticipate the needs of the people.</p><h4>What trends in demand are you noticing within Mexico?</h4><p>Mexico is not very different from the rest of the world. However, communication channels are changing. Whereas in the past a 30-second television commercial would have been sufficient, today it is not enough to reach the younger generation. Advertising, therefore, has become more fragmented across various mediums, including the internet. Additionally, consumers have become more demanding of higher quality goods and innovation. This is our commitment, and the reason why we are planning to invest around ‚¬300 million over the next five years. Furthermore, sustainability has really begun to gain consumers attention. We have a strong commitment to sustainability. We are developing new ways of doing business that will increase the positive social benefits arising from Unilever's activities, while at the same time reducing our environmental impact. The Unilever Sustainable Living Plan shows how we will do this, by making our own activities more sustainable and also by helping and encouraging our consumers, customers and suppliers to do the same.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has your department contributed to the financial performance of the Mexican economy over the last five years?</h4><p>The main contribution of the Secretariat to the Mexican economy has been its solid and prudent management of macroeconomic policy. As a result of the responsible management of fiscal policy in recent years, we were able to implement counter-cyclical policies in response to the global financial crisis, which attenuated the effect of the shock on the welfare of the population, without threatening the sustainability of public finances and the stability of the economy. This was the first time in the recent history of the country that a counter-cyclical fiscal policy was put in place in response to a crisis. In previous decades, the effects of a crisis on welfare were aggravated by the additional tightening of fiscal and monetary policy, in contrast to what was seen recently. The solid stance of our macroeconomic policy has also contributed to the vigorous recovery of the Mexican economy after the global crisis and to the fact that at present the fundamentals of the Mexican economy are very strong, without any sign of the economic imbalances that are currently prevalent in several countries around the world.</p><h4>How could new fiscal reform reducing the federal budget's reliance on oil and gas activities improve the diversification of the Mexican economy?</h4><p>One of the main objectives of the current administration has been precisely to strengthen public finances by reducing their dependence on oil revenues, and in that context two fiscal reforms directed precisely at this objective have been approved in the last four years. The first was approved in 2007 and the second in 2009. The first reform, approved in 2007, was oriented toward broadening the tax base and included measures like the introduction of a minimum income tax and a tax on cash deposits that affected only agents operating in the informal sector of the economy. The second reform, passed by congress in 2009, sought to increase tax revenues by increasing the rates of all major taxes, including income and consumption taxes, in a way that minimized their distorting effects. As a result of these two reforms, non-oil tax revenues have increased by close to two percentage points of GDP once we adjust for the position of the economic cycle. While we should continue with measures along these lines, we think that the medium term trend of non-oil revenues is very encouraging and that substantial progress has recently been achieved.</p><div class="quote">“One of the main objectives of the current administration has been precisely to strengthen public finances."</div><h4>How could the new labor reform currently under discussion improve the performance of Mexico's economy?</h4><p>The labor reform proposal under discussion is essentially geared at reducing rigidities and increasing dynamism in the labor market, thereby accelerating the creation of new jobs and promoting productivity. It also seeks to increase employment opportunities for sectors of the population that have traditionally experienced difficulty of access, like women and youth. The reform includes measures such as the addition of new hiring modalities, including temporary and probation period contracts, an update of the current legislation to make it compatible with demographic, social, and cultural changes experienced by the country during the last decades, and a series of measures and changes to expedite the administration of justice over labor disputes. If approved, the reform would lead to stronger job creation and would also accelerate labor productivity growth, which is an essential determinant of an economy´s long-term growth potential.</p><h4>What are the main pillars of the financial policy of the Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit (SHCP) since 2010, and what were its specific policy responses to the 2009 global downturn?</h4><p>Over the last years one of the critical components of our economic policy has been financial policy. Its main objective has been to provide the financial system with a prudent, solid, and modern regulatory framework. Judging by the results, we can say that we have been fairly successful in this area, as Mexico's financial system showed its strength during the global crisis and its aftermath, without any type of systemic problems. It is relevant to remember that for the last decade in Mexico we did not need to direct public resources to rescue or support financial institutions. Moreover, at present our sound financial sector contributes to the overall solid stance of the economy and to the absence of economic imbalances. We have also been working to apply the main lessons from the global crisis and from other recent events in terms of financial regulation. In line with this, we will adopt several components of Basel III in advance of the established timeline, and will comply with all of its components by the agreed dates. Finally, we made use of our development banks to make sure that credit-worthy companies were not affected given the decline in liquidity due to the international financial crisis.</p><h4>One of your main priorities is managing the public deficit. The reduced figure currently stands at 2.7% of GDP, and you are targeting 2.3% for end-2011. What role is deficit reduction playing in Mexico's economic performance?</h4><p>The framework for fiscal policy in Mexico is established in the fiscal responsibility law, according to which in normal conditions public finances have to be balanced excluding investment by PEMEX. The law contains an escape clause for extraordinary economic or social circumstances. Given the magnitude of the global financial crisis, at the end of 2009 the federal government prepared a multi-annual fiscal policy strategy that contemplated temporary and moderate fiscal deficits to support economic activity while output was below its potential level. In this context, a deficit of 0.8% excluding investment by PEMEX (or 2.8% including it) was observed in 2010, a reduction in the deficit for 2011 to 0.5% (or 2.5% including investment by PEMEX) was approved for 2011, and a further reduction to a deficit of 0.4% (or 2.4% including investment by PEMEX) was recently approved for 2012. For 2013 we are projecting a return to a balanced budget. As I mentioned before, this multi-annual fiscal policy strategy has been oriented at providing a stimulus to the economy during the recessionary phase of the economic cycle while preserving the sustainability of public finances.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

After that, we developed an application for disease control and also for weed control during the pre-emergence and post-emergence stages. We have a huge range of products that we have already introduced to Mexico in accordance with international standards. We also have a range of different technologies depending on the specific technological needs of crop fields. In the south of Mexico there is limited range of technology being utilized by small growers, while in the center of Mexico there is a huge range of technologies in operation on larger crop lands. We have pre-emergence products and then products like “Quilt" that help to protect and enhance the performance of a crop. In the north of the country, we have already tested new germplasm products—new white corn seeds and yellow corn seeds—and we are also testing biotechnology in the early stages just to be on top of the technology. In Mexico, we cover all technologies and we are trying to educate farmers to take advantage of technology to increase their yields. We can increase crop production performance by up to 15 tons per hectare in the northern states. The idea is to roll out this technology across Mexico to encourage self-sufficient production. Currently, Mexico needs to import 10 million tons of corn from the US per year, and I think we have the technology within Syngenta to increase corn yields by 20% and even by up to 40%.</p><h4>How is the new experimental station in Sinaloa increasing your participation in the agricultural sector?</h4><p>The Sinaloa research station is focused on vegetables such as tomatoes, peppers, and cucumbers. We are then developing new varieties according to the needs of the export market, mainly for the US. It's about taste, color, flavor, everything. We produce all our varieties to improve yields, and also to develop small cherry and grape tomatoes in order to obtain different results according to the demand of the US consumer market, and also the products we are testing in that region. We have also established a crop field that grows small watermelons that are sweet and are designed for just one person. Instead of having a big watermelon, it's an individual-sized one from the Dulcinea brand. We developed the technology and established Dulcinea Farms, and it produces these watermelons and exports them to US consumers.</p><div class="quote">“We cover all technologies and we are trying to educate farmers to take advantage of technology."</div><h4>Moving to the Mexican market, what have been the biggest changes in the agribusiness sector you would like to highlight since you entered the market?</h4><p>I arrived here in Mexico a decade ago. There has been a huge increase in the availability of products aimed at protecting crops from insects and diseases, and also we have contributed to improving education. We have what we call a stewardship program as well. It's been around for more than 20 years with Syngenta, where we have been explaining the best use of our products as well as agricultural best practice to more than 500,000 growers across the southern states of Mexico.</p><h4>What do you believe gives Mexico's agricultural sector a competitive advantage over other Latin American countries?</h4><p>I think that is its unique position close to the US. It gives us a very good advantage just to be able to get exports there on time. Mexico is also in a different season to the US, and that is a good opportunity. Our tropical conditions afford us multiple crops throughout the year. Mexico has a wide range of tropical fruits, including avocados, citrus, and berries. We have many crops that are already available for the US market and we are focused on maintaining quality and increasing production mainly for export to the US. Mexico has an advantage over all other Latin American countries in these kinds of situations.</p><h4>In your opinion, how significant are transgenic crops in Mexico?</h4><p>That technology is already approved and used in cotton. Mexico has commercial approval, and there has been a significant improvement in biotechnology. The big challenge is how it will be introduced in corn. Yellow corn seeds are the first test using the technology we are talking about, which is available in the US. It's safe to say that yellow corn is used to produce biofuels and feed, but it's not meant to be consumed as food. Currently, we are testing it in the northern states of Mexico to improve production as well as enhance insect resistance and water use optimization. Growers can get a crop production increase of 20% up to 40% more than they would obtain using conventional technology. We are already testing, working very hard, and following the correct process to obtain commercial approval in Mexico. I am sure it is going to be a very good advantage for all the growers who are already on top of the technology and who need a push to maximize crop potential.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the sectors you primarily target for fire security measures in Mexico? What factors affect the market here?</h4><p>We look at the industry from two primary segments: the private sector and energy. Under the private sector category, we have defined various sub-segments such as commercial, industrial, and residential, while the energy segment mainly concerns the oil and gas industry. Each segment has a different set of fire detection and suppression products and systems that we need to integrate to offer the best fire safety solutions to our customers. In the energy segment, we have a contract with PEMEX to maintain and support offshore rigs and many of their onshore facilities, which accounts for a significant portion of our business. Other growth areas for our business include tourist infrastructure, government buildings, and historic buildings. The market in Mexico is not as well regulated as other areas of the world with regard to fire safety, although the regulations have improved over the past few years. Regulation is important because it sets safety standards and promotes the use of fire safety technologies to protect people, property, and the environment.</p><div class="quote">“Kidde is recognised as one of the leaders and promoters of fire safety norms and standards in the country."</div><h4>What challenges remain to improving fire safety regulations?</h4><p>As leaders in the fire safety industry in Mexico, we actively participate in committees to promote changes in regulations that will lead to higher safety standards. We support new amendments addressing fire protection in the federal civil protection law, which is a very complex process and can take years to implement. One of the key aspects of our business in Mexico is to differentiate ourselves through the training and specialization of our technical staff, thus raising the overall standards and fire safety awareness in the industry.</p><h4>What is your strategy to increase the take up of your products in the Mexican market?</h4><p>Kidde de México began as a local safety service provider. In 2005, it was acquired by United Technologies and began its transformation into a leading supplier of fire detection and suppression systems. We changed management, changed processes, and started changing the company's culture. We implemented a market segmentation strategy that has worked well to help us sustain growth and expand our sales numbers. We believe we have an operational process that is reliable in terms of delivering what we want. In addition, as a company, we have been actively working with our partners, customers, and other stakeholders to help develop enhanced safety standards that will benefit the entire industry. As a result, Kidde is recognised as one of the leaders and promoters of fire safety norms and standards in the country.</p><h4>What are the benefits of operating in Mexico?</h4><p>We believe we have significant opportunities in Mexico as the fire safety market is still developing. Another benefit of operating in Mexico is the free trade agreements that exist between Mexico and other South American countries, such as Brazil and Argentina. For example, if products are produced in Mexico there is a discount of 50% on the import duties to export them to Argentina. This works to our advantage when exporting products from Mexico. However, exports are a small part of our business, as our main focus is the Mexico market.</p><h4>What do you expect from the local market in the long term?</h4><p>In the long term, I expect stronger fire safety regulations. Kidde is already participating in committees and is taking a lead position to promote fire safety standards locally. In addition, the technical staff we are training and developing will help drive our growth, and raise awareness of overall safety standards in industry. As United Technologies has grown in the last few years, we have gained access to new products and technologies. For example, Marioff Corporation is an important brand based in Finland, and is a leading provider of the HI-FOG® water mist fire protection system. We are in the process of customizing that system for the local market, and obtaining regulatory approvals. HI-FOG® could be especially useful for hotels, data or communications centers, and cultural-heritage sites, as it uses significantly less water than traditional sprinklers, resulting in less water damage and faster business recovery.</p><h4>What is your assessment of Mexico's workforce?</h4><p>Since 2005, Kidde has invested heavily in training and in developing our workforce. Last year we introduced a certification program for our technicians. This program provides intensive training on all our products, systems, and procedures. We also bring in experts from all over the world to train our staff. This training has been very effective in developing our local Kidde workforce. In addition, through United Technologies' Employee Scholar Program, we can offer tuition, books, and academic fees for employees to pursue college degrees. This program is helping create an educated workforce, and I believe it is the right way to retain and develop talent.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>According to your global strategic development plan, HSBC is focusing its attention on increasing investment volumes in rapid growth markets like Mexico and Turkey. What makes Mexico so attractive for HSBC?</h4><p>We've been in Mexico since 2001, and we entered the market through the acquisition of Bital, a Mexican bank that was up for sale. Our analysis of which countries to operate in relies on what we've defined as the “Five Filters." Two of the filters have to do with the macroeconomic factors of a given country, while the other three have to do with how business is performing in that particular region. The two most important filters for a country like Mexico are the two macro filters: relevance and connectivity. Mexico passes with flying colors. In terms of relevance, Mexico is the 13th largest economy in the world by purchasing power parity (PPP). Mexico will continue to be very relevant in the future as well, as it is expected to become the 10th largest economy in the world. Connectivity is also very important. In fact connectivity is at the root of HSBC's origins, having been founded by Scottish businessmen in Hong Kong and Shanghai who believed that trade was going to be the basis of global economic prosperity. Mexico is surprisingly the most connected country in the OECD. Connectivity measures how open a country is to trade, which is measured by imports plus exports divided by GDP. That shows the size of the economy that can be measured by trade flow. In Mexico the figure is 60%. That's about a $600 billion total trade flow in a trillion dollar economy. That figure is 25% for the US, 28% for China, and 22% for Brazil. Those two factors make Mexico a no-brainer for us. HSBC also already has a big presence in Mexico. In fact, one-third of all HSBC ATMs worldwide are located in Mexico, as well as 12% of all branches. If you consider that HSBC is the second largest bank in the world in terms of retail branches, you'll appreciate that these are huge numbers.</p><h4>In your 1H2011 financials, HSBC Mexico reported 23% growth in its credit portfolio, 18.1% growth in capital assets, as well as 13.98% growth in its liquidity index. What are you targeting for FY2011, and what do you expect from 2012?</h4><p>First of all, those figures also depend on accounting standards, and when we peer through the optics of the IFRS accounting standards, the figures look much better than when you look through Mexican accounting standards—twice as good in fact. The IFRS standard is what we report back to our parent company in the UK. However, for the last two years we've also seen huge organic growth in deposits, gaining an increasing market share in customer deposits. We've had healthy growth in our credit portfolio, particularly with SMEs and consumer loans. We also did a major clean up of our credit portfolio on the consumer side. We make sure to try and recognize our losses early on to take immediate action, rather than coming up with creative ways of brushing things under the carpet. Although we weren't doing that well in 2008-2009, we were still ahead of the cycle, and we really took off in 2010 after having dealt with delinquent loans.</p><div class="quote">“We make sure to try and recognize our losses early on to take immediate action."</div><h4>How is the new credit line for SMEs that you opened in March 2011 responding to your expectations?</h4><p>That's going very well. We launched this project in conjunction with the development bank Nafin, and it followed its progress very closely. This product, which was launched in March 2011, has Ps1 billion ($74 million) in credit card receivables. SMEs told us that their main problem was that it was hard to access a credit line, and so we asked them what they would like, and that turned out to be a credit card. It's exactly like a personal credit card, but more flexible. A company gives its main card to the CEO, who gives subsidiary cards to other people in the company, and they all use the card on one company account. Another card we launched is for travelers, basically a traveler's check without the checks, like a pre-loaded debit card.</p><h4>What impact is your $700 million investment in renovating the HSBC branch network having on your operations?</h4><p>Our branch network has decreased by 300 branches, from 1,400 to 1,100. We now have more sales, more deposits, more credit lines, and better efficiency. We closed some closet branches and opened larger branches instead. We're also trying to renovate the look and feel of each branch, spending around $650,000 per branch. It's a major refurbishment, not just a paint job. Also, we don't have lines anymore in our branches. We have greeters who direct people to ATMs at the branches, where you can do 480 different things. More and more people are getting used to using ATMs or are doing their business online, so that means no more lines in our branches. Our internet banking system is excellent. It's more convenient for our customers, and it's also more cost-efficient for us. We're not just changing the look and feel, we're changing the way people are doing their banking. Another policy we focus on is diversity, and we include physically handicapped people as our employees, making them greeters at our branches, for example.</p><h4>What impact will the launching of the low cost mortgage loan “Hipoteca a tu alcance," with a fixed rate of 10.4% have on the Mexican market?</h4><p>We're very optimistic about mortgages, which we consider a commodity. We aim to be the fastest on the market in terms of executing mortgages. There are other, more competitive rate offers from our competitors, but we've found that people are willing to pay a little extra for good service.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[On Top of Priorities]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[on-top-of-priorities]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Turkey's economic history is full of periods of rapid growth and long stagnations. What is different about the latest period of growth?</h4><p>During the last nine years Turkey has gone through a period of strong political stability, and we benefited from this. The AK Party (Justice and Development Party) government has successfully implemented political and economic reforms in a timely manner. Turkey has been continuously upgrading itself when it comes to democratic standards. This is really an important source of strength for us, as we base our policies on the aspirations and will of the people. Putting individuals' and citizens' welfare at the core of our policies has paved the way to strong growth and employment generation. When the AK Party came to power, Turkey's budget deficit was 12% of GDP, and its debt-to-GDP ratio was 74% at the end of 2002. Looking at the latest fiscal figures, we expect our budget deficit to decelerate to 1.7% of GDP in 2011. In parallel with this decline, our debt-to-GDP ratio will be below 40%. The fiscal adjustment process was very important for Turkey. On the monetary policy side, our Central Bank has been very successful in fighting the chronic problem of inflation. For 34 years in Turkey, the inflation rate has been in double-digit territory. However, during our term, it has dropped to single-digit levels. We are targeting even lower single-digit figures for the following years. Coming to structural reforms, we were able to make comprehensive social security reforms, including pension reforms. We were able to perform healthcare reform with a wide coverage. Furthermore, our banking system went through a significant reform process, enabling our banks to be quite strong compared to most other countries. Turkey has undergone timely reforms in all of the areas that developed economies are now struggling with. The structural change that Turkey has gone through is now a very important source of strength for us, and one that we will have on our agenda for the years to come. In this regard, attaining sustainable growth, enhancing the investment environment, labor market reforms, tax reform, and dealing with the informal economy, and reforms in the finance sector are aimed at making Istanbul one of the top 10 financial centers globally; these are some of the key agenda items for us.</p><h4>Turkey's current account deficit is a noted concern. What sort of measures may be necessary to keep the deficit under control?</h4><p>Strong economic performance, on the one hand, and high dependency on oil and natural gas imports, on the other, have brought about a relatively high current account deficit. Bearing this problem in mind, we are designing and implementing fiscal and monetary policies so as to gradually bring down the current account deficit. Furthermore, we are aware of the importance of targeted structural reforms to fight this problem. This may require more R&amp;D spending, more innovation, more high-tech production, and higher value-added production in Turkey, and even better education policies, which will ultimately help generate higher value-added production. On the fiscal policy side, we are determined to maintain our tight policy stance. Generating a primary surplus is not an easy thing to do during turbulent times, but we were able to do this in 2011 and will continue to do so until 2014. A tight fiscal policy stance is going to be one of our most important policy tools. Another important tool is going to be proactive measures by the Central Bank to maintain financial stability. Regarding the balance of payments, and with necessary measures not being taken, some negative consequences for financial stability might occur. Our Central Bank is also looking from that perspective. Furthermore, increasing R&amp;D spending in Turkey, and moving to higher value-added production is going to be important. In 2010 our R&amp;D spending was 0.8% of GDP. For the year 2023, our target is to reach an R&amp;D spending level of 3% of GDP, where 1% comes from public sector and 2% comes from the private sector.</p><h4>After expected GDP growth of 7% in 2011, what are some of the key measures that the government's medium-term economic program is looking to bring regarding growth?</h4><p>The Medium Term Program covers the period between 2012 and 2014. The next three years, as signaled by the global economic outlook or the European economic outlook, are not going to be easy. Our Medium Term Program is in line with a mediocre medium-term outlook for the global economy. We are targeting growth rates like 4% for 2012, and 5% for 2013 and 2014. Compared with many countries it is probably still a relatively high rate of growth, though below our potential. Turkey's growth potential is much higher. Although a better outcome than projected is much appreciated, we do also need to be prepared for the worst global scenario. This was our motivation when preparing our Medium Term Program. In the area of fiscal policies, the target deficit for 2014 is 1%, and now we are at 1.7%. Thus, we will gradually go down from 1.7% to 1%. On the monetary policy side, we have a similar picture. The Central Bank is independent and its first priority is price stability. As long as it does not conflict with that priority, the Central Bank will also take into account the government's growth targets. However, let me underscore one more time that the number one priority for the Central Bank is price stability. The Central Bank is also going to contribute to financial stability. It will cooperate with other government units for particular measures on financial stability. Regarding the banking system, we are several steps ahead of Europe. However, we want to be ready. Macroeconomic issues such as production or other financial aspects regarding our banking system are essential parts of our macroeconomic approach. Further reform areas for the medium term include the labor market, an improved investment environment, financial sector, and taxation policies.</p><div class="quote">“Putting individuals' and citizens' welfare at the core of our policies has paved the way to strong growth."</div><h4>What measures are being taken to reduce Turkey's reliance on imports and improve its export performance?</h4><p>We are looking at schemes to produce imported products in which we have a sustainable competitive advantage in Turkey. It is very important to exclude those products or sectors in which we don't have a sustainable competitive advantage. Therefore, we are going to be very picky in that respect.  Furthermore, we are moving into alternative energy resources. Currently, Turkey is highly dependent on fossil fuels. However, we are putting more emphasis on renewable energy sources. In this regard, literally speaking, hundreds of licenses have been issued for wind power and hydro energy, which have significant amounts of investment. Additionally, solar energy is just starting up. Despite the ongoing debates started after the Fukushima incident, we still think that nuclear energy is crucial for Turkey, as we are not sure whether renewables will be sufficient for our future energy needs. We need at least three nuclear plants in Turkey by the year 2023, so that nuclear energy would constitute a major part of our energy resources. In addition to our energy policy, Turkey also needs to be more competitive in the labor market and have better labor-market strategies. In addition, judicial reform to make our courts more efficient, more predictable, and more reliable is going to be very important to make Turkey an easy environment for investors, so that we will have more and more international investments, especially in terms of FDI to Turkey. Compared with previous times, FDI is quite high, but we think that we can do better.</p><h4>How would you describe the changing relationship between Turkey and the IMF?</h4><p>Turkey has been a shareholder of the IMF since its very early days. We have had different phases in our relationship. During the first six years of our government, we were in two different standby arrangements; the 18th and 19th standby arrangements. These were actually the only two standby arrangements completed successfully. The previous 17 standby arrangements were agreed before our government came into power, and they failed. The important issue for us at that time was ownership. The IMF provided funding and technical expertise, but the program details and reforms were ours. We shaped and finalized the program. That is why these programs were successful. Since 2008, we have not been in standby arrangements with the Fund. We went through a post-program monitoring phase, and that phase is also now over, because our debts to the IMF are now quite low—$3.6 billion. It was once up to $30 billion. On the other hand, we are still working closely with the technical team. We have just been through an Article IV Review, like every country does. Regarding the results of this review, the policy management implemented during the crisis was praised by the Fund. I can say that we have learned from each other. While we gained a lot from international experience, I think that the IMF technical team has learned a lot from the successful Turkish experience as well. Thus, IMF representatives for Turkey are now in high-ranking positions, very close to the top management in the Fund. In any relationship there are ups and downs, but this is the nature of it, and we are still benefiting from their technical work.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2011</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Central Bank of Turkey (CBT) is pursuing an experimental policy in lowering interest rates while increasing reserve requirements. In your opinion, what will be the net impact of this policy?<br></h4><p>It is an interesting—albeit unconventional—policy. There are mixed outlooks for the policy, but it seems like it is working. One of the hesitations that the government had was that Turkey's economic success so far has drawn a lot of investments into Turkey, and especially hot money, i.e. short-term-oriented capital coming in and out of the country. This policy change is aimed at averting this challenge. On the one hand, lowering interest rates is still going to stimulate the economy, and raising the reserve requirements will affect the entrance and exit of hot money, and will help promote longer-term investments in Turkey. Coming up with an entry or exit tax on capital movements is not popular and wouldn't work in Turkey. With these policies the parameters can be changed very quickly, and depending on progress and international developments the CBT can lower or increase the reserve requirements. Changing interest rates so often is not desirable, but reserve requirements are easier to handle and help deposits to be longer term, and promote longer-term investments. Regarding the stock exchange, foreign investors own two-thirds of the free float, and their average holding period is over a year. Combined with the fact that two-thirds of the free float belongs to institutional investors, accounting for 15% of the daily volume, we can easily see that the hot money issue is not affecting the equity markets. The problem is mainly in short-term instruments such as the fixed income and money markets. Net outflows from our equity market have only been $750 million, and our daily volume is over $2.2 billion. Last year net inflows were over $5 billion. In the month of January 2011 alone, net outflows were a little over $700 million.</p><h4>How will the policy stand up following a likely improvement in Turkey's investment grade?</h4><p>The rating improvement to the investment grade will herald an increased amount of capital coming into the country, and the policies undertaken are in preparation for that. Everybody else in the world is considering similar measures, and some countries, such as Brazil, have applied an exit tax, which hasn't been so effective. Brazil is attracting a lot of foreign capital, and Turkey is now beginning to attract foreign capital in a similar way. Turkey has managed the effects of the crisis very well. The effect was sharp in 2008, but the recovery was quick. We saw the index drop quickly in 2008 as people lost confidence in the banks in the rest of the world and treated Turkish banks in the same manner. At the end of the 2008, investors saw the banking sector in Turkey declaring record high profits, and this continued in 2009 and 2010.</p><div class="quote">“We have over a million investor accounts in the central depository, and these are all individual investors."</div><h4>How do you expect the banks to react to a lower interest rate climate?</h4><p>The expectation now is that, seeing as interest rates are low, the banking sector may not make as much money as in 2009 and 2010. Banking stocks are slightly lower, yet new capital is coming in, and this creates an opportunity. The banking sector has traditionally been making good money, coming from government securities, which are now not as profitable. The government's need for borrowing has gone down, with total public sector debt previously being around 85% of GDP, though now it is down to about 42%. So, there is room for growth. Banks have started issuing bonds to raise cheaper capital. Credit to the real sector has also been increasing, and it will increase even more in 2011, yet under the gaze of the banking regulator, which does not want to see a huge increase in credit extended to the real sector. There is huge growth in mortgage and real sector credits, and the banks haven't utilized these areas well enough in the past. The growth story of the Turkish banking sector is not over. Mortgage credits outstanding are less than 10% of all credits in the banking sector, but in other developed countries and developing countries that is 30-40%, and even 50%. There is a huge growth potential for the banks. The banks will continue keeping the economy growing, and the interest in banking stocks will continue. In terms of the real sector, we have seen good growth in 2010 and in 2011 with lower interest rates and costs of borrowing, and new investments will continue. We just saw the production index was way above expectations—capacity utilization rates have increased. This is also fueling growth. We will see the economy grow in 2011, and measures have been taken to smoothen that rate.</p><h4>2010 was a bumper year for the IMKB in terms of IPOs. What expectations do you have in 2011?</h4><p>In the first 35 days of 2011 we had five public offerings. We have 10 more applications that we are reviewing as of February 2011. After a meeting that heralded the start of a national campaign on public offerings, 18 new companies joined between May 2010 and January 2011 compared to only four between January and May 2010. Obviously, increasing awareness is helping. We have also taken steps to simplify the process of coming to market, and we are approaching companies all around the country and making it known that an offering does not mean a loss of control or incessant auditing.</p><h4>Many new instruments and platforms were seen in 2010. How is this shaping the evolution of the stock exchange?</h4><p>We introduced a warrants market, new fixed-income markets, a second repo market, and we have also launched a new market for SMEs. The warrants market is developing slowly as the investor base here is still very amateur. The SME segment is also unique in that it offers different IPO methods, trades differently, is more lenient on disclosure periods of financial statements and independent audit requirements, and has also a tailored listing fee scheme. We have over a million investor accounts in the central depository, and these are all individual investors. Individual investors are the major force behind the liquidity in the market. When you look at the large amount of investors, the active ones are even fewer. Short-term investors generate the liquidity, but this liquidity has to be sustainable, and this means we have to increase the institutional investor base. The institutional investor base is really the type of investor that looks for more sophisticated investments. Warrants are a more sophisticated instrument, and individual investors do not know enough about them. It is a learning process, and it will take a while to develop the market, and we are pushing, through campaigns, to increase the supply of instruments coming to market, and the awareness necessary for them to be successful.</p><h4>What industries do you believe have the most growth potential in Turkey?</h4><p>I believe construction, electronics and automobile manufacturing, tourism, banking, and, in the next 5 to 10 years, software and services will develop quickly. The country will also remain strong in textiles, yet value-added products have to be introduced to the market as Turkey cannot compete against China in this area.</p><h4>What is Istanbul's potential to become a major global financial center?</h4><p>Istanbul has a very large potential. The government is now taking certain steps and the city will now begin to be identified more internationally as a city with great potential to become a financial center. Istanbul has a strong, innovative banking system, and technologically it is strong and innovative. The equity market is one of the largest in the area from Eastern Europe to Singapore. With the developed equity and fixed income markets that we have, derivatives will also take off quickly. We have a well-educated workforce in the financial sector, and the geographic position of the nation can also not be overlooked. It is a hugely diversified nation. A lot of Turkish companies are becoming international, and strong infrastructure together with good standards of living will contribute to making Istanbul a strong financial center.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2011</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your assessment of the Central Bank of Turkey's policy of cutting interest rates and raising capital reserve requirements?<br></h4><p>It is a new policy. Normally, the policy of the Central Bank of Turkey (CBT) was price stability. Price stability was perceived as something local, and previously only inflation and growth expectations were taken into account. This is the first time the bank has considered external factors such as capital inflows explicitly. This new policy is not based solely on interest rates, but also on non-interest rate variables such as reserve requirements. It is considered that capital inflows strengthen the Turkish lira, and thus are a key factor behind the current account deficit. The CBT believes that by decreasing interest rates, the current account deficit issue will be alleviated and the quality of financing will improve. When interest rates are decreased, this will also stimulate local demand, and this will be compensated for by increased reserve requirements. It is too early to predict the overall effect. However, we know that it will have an effect on the Turkish lira. The era of the overvalued lira may end in 2011.</p><h4>Is Bank is one of the first private banks to sell Turkish lira-denominated bond issues. Can you tell us a little about these activities?</h4><p>Until the mid-1990s Turkey had a very active Turkish lira bond market. After the 1994 Turkish financial crisis, due to tax regulations and high interest rates, this market became inactive. A few years ago the tax regime changed, and interest rates decreased again. This led to a reopening of the market. We first advised on a Turkish lira bond offering three years ago, and this year was an active year that saw us close six deals. These bonds are traded on the Istanbul Stock Exchange and are real moneymakers. We see this trend continuing. This year most large banks have announced that they will issue Turkish lira bonds, as well as some of the smaller sized banks. This market will continue to be dominated by the banking industry.</p><div class="quote">“This year we expect the market to remain lively in various sectors."</div><h4>The Turkish market saw a high level of IPOs over 2010. What is your outlook for the IPO market in the medium term?</h4><p>In the first half of 2010 there was a demand for IPOs in the capital markets. However, due to market conditions, and the problems the euro and eurozone countries faced, this demand was fragile. Funds in Europe were reluctant to subscribe to IPOs and due to various economic reasons and uncertainty they preferred to wait. In the second half of the year the picture changed. We saw higher subscription levels for Turkish IPOs, and companies believed in the strength of the Turkish economy despite the global economic woes. IPOs thus became very successful, and we believe this trend will continue over the next six months. A few months ago we closed a deal for Do &amp; Co, a catering company. This company is based in Austria and had been trading on the Vienna Stock Exchange. The main shareholder, however, is Turkish and at the IPO we sold ‚¬65 million worth of stock, and it was 15 times oversubscribed. This example shows the level of appetite.</p><h4>What is behind this high investor interest and confidence in the Turkish story?</h4><p>Generally, the economies of countries in this region are based on natural resources. Turkey has the only economy that is based on production. Turkey produces everything. There are many companies in each industry, and each industry exports. The economy is highly diversified, and there is no single driving force. This is the main advantage of this country.</p><h4>What structural weaknesses can you identify in the Turkish economy?</h4><p>The main challenge is the high current account deficit. Our exports are growing, yet our imports are growing at a faster rate. This poses a challenge for Turkey and for the region as a whole. Our economy is reliant on external savings. We have few natural energy resources and therefore rely on imports. A steel company, for example, needs scrap and energy. It imports scrap, produces steel, and then exports it. This is the main characteristic of this country.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2011</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How much was spent on upgrading Telsim's network, and is there a need for more investment to bring the network up to international standards?<br></h4><p>Vodafone's entrance into Turkey represents the second largest FDI in the country's history and the initial acquisition spending was only the beginning of broader long-term investment in the country. The cumulative investment made until this day, including the acquisition price, has already exceeded TL10 billion. Our intensive investment plan has been centered around one single objective: to deliver the best customer experience to our subscribers. Right after the acquisition, we prioritized our investments to upgrade our technology infrastructure. In the last three years, we have expanded our network coverage extensively by tripling the total number of our base stations, including the expansion made after the 3G launch as of mid-2009. Meanwhile, together with our trade business partners, we have also invested in the expansion of our sales and distribution capabilities, enlarging our distribution network to over 1,000 exclusive shops across Turkey and to 90% numeric distribution in the telecoms retail channel. Notably, we also made significant investments to build our brand as a trustmark in the hearts and minds of our customers.</p><h4>Since your appointment as CEO in 2009, Vodafone's market share has increased from 18.6% to 26.4%, with 16.7 million subscribers. What is behind this success?</h4><p>Back in the beginning of 2009, with strong confidence in the potential of the Turkish market, we decided to develop a new long-term strategic plan for Vodafone Turkey. This business plan was developed with a “bottom-up" approach involving the ideas and inputs of a larger group of managers in the company. The approach was instrumental in empowering our team to contribute to the strategies of the company and installing confidence to execute successful plans. We selected “customer centricity" as the primary focus of our business plan. Customer satisfaction and moreover the customer recommendation rate became the key performance indicators embraced by the whole organization.</p><p>We are pleased with our progress so far and think that our business performance is a solid indicator of the robustness of our strategic plan. Our revenue has been growing at around the 30%-plus levels over the last few quarters, making Vodafone Turkey the fastest growing operating company in the Vodafone Europe region. Our business plan has been focused on three key strategic segments where we demonstrated remarkable growth rates over October-December 2010. Firstly, the post-paid customer base has grown by 78% plus on a year-on-year basis. Secondly, in the enterprise segment, our revenue has grown by 49% year-on-year. Thirdly, in data, we have also registered a record growth rate of 155%. As a result, over the last eight quarters, we have increased our revenue market share by nearly 8 percentage points to a level of 26.4%. Surpassing the 25% revenue market share has been an important milestone for us.</p><h4>What is next after the 25% revenue market share milestone?</h4><p>Our 3-5 year strategic plan is based on achieving a long-term sustainable growth. This will be realized by maintaining our revenue growth with increased profitability.</p><div class="quote">“Vodafone's entrance into Turkey represents the second largest FDI in the country's history."</div><h4>Was Vodafone able to take advantage of the post-mobile number portability (MNP) environment?</h4><p>The introduction of MNP in November 2008 marked one of the most important milestones in increasing fairness and competitiveness in the mobile telecommunications industry. Initially, Vodafone Turkey was not off to a very good start. Our revenue trend line was actually declining. After the launch of our new customer-centric business plan, we went into a recovery period of reversing the losses. With our turnaround plan, we were able to regain our subscribers and consequently revenues. Two years down the line I can say that we have successfully achieved our goal. Today, Vodafone Turkey is the undisputed leader in MNP with a net 2 million number additions since the November 2008 launch to date.</p><h4>Vodafone Turkey was among the best performing members of the entire Vodafone group during the financial crisis. What can this be attributed to?</h4><p>The Turkish economy during the global crisis did relatively better than most of the developed countries. This is partially due to the soundness of the Turkish banking sector, which has gone through a substantial reform process following the 2001 crisis and partly also due to the adaptability and agility of the Turkish business environment. As a result of the resilience of the Turkish economy and an ambitious turnaround plan, Vodafone Turkey has succeeded in achieving remarkable growth despite the global downturn.</p><h4>Can we say that Turkey has reached saturation point in terms of the number of mobile telephone users, or is growth still possible?</h4><p>In the recent period, the reduction in the number of total subscribers in the market is mainly a consequence of SIM card consolidation. Multi-SIM ownership has dropped from historic 30% levels down to 10% levels lately. In the future, we expect subscriber numbers will increase due to several factors. Firstly, the number of subscribers will rise as the population grows. Additionally, the point of entry is declining to a lower age, increasing the addressable market. Moreover, we expect the data business will create various opportunities. Mobile broadband will increase penetration, influencing additional SIMs per subscriber coming into play due to SIM-embedded devices such as mobile modems and tablets. Machine-to-machine usage should also grow rapidly. Western markets indicate penetration rates well above 100%, which should also be attainable in Turkey in the future.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2011</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize the business environment for foreign investors in Turkey?</h4><p>In 2009, Turkey's economy managed to grow by 9% and became the fastest growing economy in its region. In the first half of 2011, we grew by 10.2% and became the fastest growing economy in the world, surpassing China, India and, Argentina. Our FDI laws grant national treatment to foreign investors. There are no limitations, no restrictions, and no permissions required except in a few specific sectors. Investors are subject to the same rules, laws, and regulations as local companies. Entering and exiting the Turkish market is quite easy. We have a very liberal business environment. Furthermore, company establishment procedures were simplified remarkably. Foreign investors can register their companies in five or six days at the most and start doing business thereafter. Investors are also granted quite generous investment incentives. Thus, we highly recommend to our foreign friends that they consider Turkey as a serious option in their search for new markets.</p><h4>The Istanbul Chamber of Commerce (ITO) is one of the largest of its kind in the world. How significant is its role within the Turkish economy?</h4><p>ITO represents a considerably large portion of the Turkish business community. Before anything else, this stems from Istanbul's great share and weight in the Turkish economy. With more than 25% of total GDP, around 50% of total external trade volume, nearly 28% of total industrial value added, a sixth of Turkey's population, 43% of the state's total tax revenues, 50% of all foreign investments, and one-quarter of all commercial companies, we call Istanbul “the heart and the brain" of the Turkish economy. As a result, ITO is one of the largest chambers in the world with more than 300,000 active members. This puts great responsibility on our shoulders, and we try to actively participate in reshaping the Turkish economy and business environment in parallel with the needs and demands of our members. We develop big projects not only for Istanbul, but also for the whole country. Several years ago, we developed the “Eastern Anatolia Tourism Focused Development Project" in cooperation with other public institutions. One of our biggest and most recent projects is the “Istanbul Technology Development Zone," which is expected to become operational in 2013, attract 1,000 companies, and create $10 billion worth of value-added in high-tech industries. We also focus heavily on improving Turkey's foreign economic and commercial relations. Introducing our businessmen to international markets, increasing their competitiveness, as well as building relations with foreign counterpart institutions and associations is among our major responsibilities.</p><div class="quote">“ITO is one of the largest chambers in the world with more than 300,000 active members."</div><h4>What sort of regulatory changes do you think still need to be made to improve the business environment in Turkey?</h4><p>Although the Turkish business environment has improved remarkably over the last decade, I believe there are still some urgent issues ahead of us. Reducing the tax burdens on employment further, increasing the flexibility of the labor market, combating the informal economy, substantially reforming our judicial system, making the intellectual property rights system more effective, and eliminating some bureaucratic procedures will improve Turkey's business environment much further and make the country more attractive and competitive for doing business.</p><h4>What are the most important recent changes to the Turkish Commercial Code that foreign investors should be aware of?</h4><p>The new code introduces some significant changes to both internal commercial life and foreign investments. From July 2012, it will be possible to establish a joint stock company with only one shareholder, as opposed to the five shareholders required in the current law. This shift represents an attitude in favor of SMEs, which will have the opportunity to be discharged from unlimited responsibility by forming a joint stock company. It has some important implications for foreign investors as well, since they no longer have to find partners in order to fulfill the minimum partner requirement. There is also a possibility for existing companies to restructure as single shareholder companies without the risk of dissolution. According to the new code, the auditing of companies is to be conducted by independent auditing firms, sworn financial advisers, or independent accounting financial advisers for SMEs only, instead of an internal auditing system. This would help to secure a more institutionalized and transparent system, together with the requirement for all companies to create a website where they will publish information, including their annual reports, financial statements, and audit reports. Lastly, the new code enables companies to operate in areas outside the fields of activity determined in their articles of incorporation. Therefore, an existing company will be able to introduce a sub-industry in addition to its main field of activity if it wishes to do so.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2011</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Domestic stability is a key demand for foreign investors. How do you respond to this sensitivity?</h4><p>If you look at political stability in Turkey over the past nine years, it has been remarkable—especially given the fact that we had major economic crises in 1999 and 2001. Political stability and strong leadership have supported and strengthened economic development in Turkey. The government has been able to overcome not just the global financial crisis but also the ups and downs of the Turkish economy by taking a number of measures in such areas as investing in research and development, increasing production, securing the banking system, diversifying trade, finding new areas of investment, and attracting FDI.</p><h4>How significant is the establishment of a new constitution in promoting Turkey's democratic values internationally?</h4><p>It's one of the most important and ambitious national projects we've had in a long time in Turkey. We have had three constitutions in the Republican period: 1924, 1960, and 1982. The 1982 constitution was written after the military coup of 1980 and no longer caters to the needs of the new Turkey in the 21st century. In addition, that constitution has been amended so many times that it has lost its internal coherence. It is crucial for Turkey's future to write a new, modern, and civilian constitution. It is key for the new Turkey that is emerging with its democratic institutions, economy, new infrastructure, young population, and its new foreign policy. The needs and aspirations of the new Turkey will be reflected in the new constitution and it will boost Turkey's development and remove many of the bureaucratic obstacles that concern business communities and investors. It will expand the areas of freedoms and civil liberties and establish the principles of equality, justice, and constitutional citizenship for all Turkish citizens. This is one area in which other nations, especially in the Arab world, have taken a keen interest. They, too, want to live in a system of democracy, under the rule of law and with transparency, and they look to Turkey as a source of inspiration and as an experience to be shared in terms of how Turkey has overcome years of military tutelage and resolved issues that have been on our agenda for many years: democratization, pluralism, religious minorities, human rights, civil liberties, and economic development. Therefore, our democracy is key to our political stability and economic development.</p><div class="quote">“It is crucial for Turkey's future to write a new, modern, and civilian constitution."</div><h4>How do you envision Turkey's role in the transition to democracy for countries involved in the Arab spring?</h4><p>From the outset, we have supported the people's demand for democracy, rule of law, justice, and transparency in Egypt, Tunisia, Libya, and in Syria, Yemen, and other places. Leaders should listen to their people's legitimate demands. We believe this is in their national interest as well as in the interest of the region. When Prime Minister Erdoí°an visited Egypt, Tunisia, and Libya in September 2011, he was received as embodying these core messages. There is major interest in improving bilateral relations with Turkey. Of course, we already have wide-ranging relations with all the countries in the Arab world. But there is always room for wider and deeper relations in all sectors of life. We will continue to cooperate with these countries and increase our diplomatic, cultural, and economic relations. We know that we cannot live in a stable environment where our neighbors are unstable, weak, or economically lagging behind. A democratic and prosperous Arab world is possible and the Arab people have shown that it is possible through their revolutions.</p><h4>To what extent have “soft power" measures such as international conferences and student exchange/scholarship programs been successful to promote Turkey?</h4><p>There is nothing like face-to-face human interaction. The major summits, forums, and conferences held in Turkey in recent years have been hugely successful. By hosting such major meetings as the NATO summit, the World Water Summit, the World Congress of Architects, the UN Somalia meeting, and IMF and World Bank meetings, just to mention a few, and hundreds of cultural and artistic festivals and academic seminars, Turkey has shown its capacity to host international events but also become a center of debate and discussion for global issues. This is not only because we have good venues; it is because Turkey stands at the crossroads of all major global and regional issues.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Turkey's regional and global position, both economically and diplomatically in the medium term?</h4><p>If you make a list of 10 major global issues today from energy security to the Middle East peace process, easily six, seven of them will concern the Balkans, the Middle East, the Caucasus, and Africa—at the center of which we are located. We cannot run away from that geography. We are part of it and we try to turn it into a strategic asset. Therefore any positive contribution we make to any small issue from youth entrepreneurship to the Middle East peace process and poverty eradication and education, we believe we are making a contribution to world peace.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2011</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[time-to-stand-out]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>To what extent has the eurozone crisis presented opportunity for Turkish business?</h4><p>The eurozone crisis represents an opportunity for Turkey in the sense that Turkey and a few BRIC countries will be the sites of growth for corporations. However, because of the eurozone crisis, the banks will have to withdraw themselves from Europe as well as the BRIC countries because the European banks have constraints on adequate capital and funding for 2012 and perhaps 2013 as well. It will be negative for Turkey and the BRICs in the sense that they will not be able to borrow as much from the banks, and corporations will not be able to borrow as much from European banks. At the same time, cash-rich corporations can invest in Turkey, because it's a growing country with certain industries that are very attractive for investors. The most prominent is energy. The Turkish economy has been called a catch-up economy by economists in the sense that a lot of things that have already developed in Western countries are just developing in Turkey. One example is shopping centers and the retail business. These did not exist in Turkey 15 or 20 years ago. Now, these businesses—as well as real estate—are driving Turkey's growth.</p><h4>With inflation now approaching 10%, the current account deficit is, in real terms, the second largest in the world. Is the Turkish economy in danger of overheating?</h4><p>The Turkish economy may have overheated, but I have full confidence in the economic team of our government. They have taken quite a few measures to cool the economy. They are trying to balance what I call the “Bermuda Triangle": the foreign exchange price, the current account deficit, and interest rates. The current account deficit is coming down and the economy is cooling. I think in the last quarter of 2011 and the first quarter of 2012 this will be more evident. Turkey cannot manage an $8 billion or $9 billion dollar account deficit, but it can manage a $4 billion to $5 billion deficit. In other words, $50 to $60 billion is a maximum, though $40 to $50 billion dollars is better. Our energy bill is that much—about $50 billion per year. Our current account deficit should not be more than our energy bill. It should be less than our energy bill. This is how the math works.</p><div class="quote">“The eurozone crisis represents an opportunity for Turkey."</div><h4>Fiba Group is investing in energy—especially renewables. Why is this such an attractive market?</h4><p>Energy is one of the most exciting growing businesses here. We're becoming involved with renewable energy, especially wind. Turkey actually has the second highest wind capacity in Europe after Scotland. Germany only has a 25% to 30% wind load factor potential, depending on the location. In Turkey our potential is 35% to 45%. This makes a big difference in the renewable energy business. Turkey also has the second highest solar capacity after Spain. But solar energy technology is still expensive, though it still has room to come down. The government doesn't want to subsidize solar energy until technology prices are lower.</p><h4>What about Fibabank in Turkey? What role can it play in the very competitive Turkish banking market?</h4><p>The banking market is competitive, but it's also growing and there are a lot of opportunities. Since we just re-entered this market about a year ago, we don't try to do everything. We are only involved in the SME business, commercial business, and client-related treasury activities. We plan to go into retail banking slowly in 2012 when our IT infrastructure is complete. We expect it to be complete in the last week of January. As a commercial bank you must have very flexible and scalable technology.</p><h4>As the founder of Özyeí°in University, what impact will it have as an entrepreneurial incubator?</h4><p>We don't just try to give our students an academic education, we want them to be extroverted and curious. Between high school and business life, university is a passageway. We want to make that very rewarding. We are the first university that has an undergraduate program in entrepreneurship. I think that the whole world thinks that the savior of the world economy will be entrepreneurs. If you look at the US, the major companies shed 3 million employees in 2010 because they discovered that during the crisis they can produce the same goods and services with fewer employees. Three million became unemployed from major industrial corporations, and entrepreneurs and small businesses then hired these 3 million. That's why US unemployment is still around the 9% level and it didn't go up. Entrepreneurship in Turkey, in the past two or three years, has grown exponentially. There have been more write-ups, conferences, and articles than in the previous few decades. I think people caught on to this and the government, universities, and private sector have caught on to this as well. I think that universities are the catalyst between the government, the private sector, and entrepreneurs. At Özyeí°in University we try to couple with industry, and namely TÜBíTAK, which funds R&amp;D. We also try to encourage students to become entrepreneurs. That's why we have what we call an entrepreneurship factory in the university. Young men and women apply with their projects, and if these projects are found to be worthwhile then successful entrepreneurs and professors mentor them to move their projects forward. If they can reach a level where they can be commercialized, then we find angel investors to support them further. We try to bring their ideas to a more advanced stage.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Dubai successfully melts a cosmopolitan society in an inherently Arabian pot. How do you define the Dubai spirit and what differentiates Dubai from other centers in the region?</h4><p>Dubai has been a pioneer in the region, and like any pioneer it has always been ahead of the pack. As a pioneer, Dubai has discovered a lot of things that others now take for granted. Beginning in the 1970s with the development of Jebel Ali Port, the plan was hailed as a white elephant. In a skeptical environment it thrived, and it is still one of the main drivers of economic growth in the Emirate. Similarly, when Dubai started Emirates Airlines, a lot of people thought that there was a lack of experience. There were many examples of failure around us. However, within 10 years Emirates Airlines has become the third largest airline in the world and sets the standards for the airline business. Tourism has also become a mainstay of the economy. People thought that due to the temperature Dubai wouldn't be able to attract enough tourists—now an environment has been created whereby visitors can enjoy all seasons. The number of tourists has been growing consistently over the years. The recent financial crisis hit the whole global economy, which we are a part of. Therefore, our dreams and aspirations shrunk because the environment has changed completely. At the same time it made Dubai go back to its core businesses—logistics, trade, and hospitality—that have always worked well over the past 20 or even 30 years. It is a period of consolidation and focusing on segments that worked really well. Three years into the recession we see that those core businesses and sectors of the economy are becoming the real growth engines again.</p><h4>What is your presence in logistics, trade, and hospitality in this period of consolidation?</h4><p>We as a group operate in four segments: construction and real estate, technology, trading, and investments. Construction was hit by the crisis, but we are going back to developing smaller projects. That is where the market is nowadays. The technology front is doing well, because there are always new projects and new products. As we focus on enterprise solutions, companies are interested in our work as it decreases their costs and increases their efficiency. Trade numbers are also a back up. In the investment field, we are focusing on hospitality as we see growth in that area.</p><div class="quote">“Dubai has been a pioneer in the region, and like any pioneer it has always been ahead of the pack."</div><h4>The hospitality sector is already very developed and competitive in Dubai. What niches do you see?</h4><p>There is a gap in the three- and four-star market, as well as the lower categories. That is why we are developing our projects in these areas. This is the area that needs attention, whereas the five-star market is saturated. This is an open market economy where people need to do their homework, collect data, and develop their projects. We do not see any vagueness in the industry, although there are speculations on the future supply of beds in the hospitality sector. These numbers need to be quantified and qualified. Not all the big numbers that you see around are real; they are not updated and can reflect the pre-crisis environment. We are planning to manage our own resorts, and yet we are open to see if we can partner with operating chains out there. Our target is, nevertheless, to bring something new into the market.</p><h4>What is the weight of each segment in your group's operations?</h4><p>Our technology branch doesn't require a lot of investment, while real estate is very capital intensive. However, now the hospitality segment is taking a large share of our business.</p><h4>Dubai is a popular destination for foreign investment inflows. As the numbers come back to normal are you seeing a change in the origin of investments?</h4><p>Dubai is not dependent on foreign capital. There is an abundance of capital in Dubai, and in the UAE overall. Having said that, Dubai has a very investment-friendly environment. It is all about the friendliness and the opportunities that present themselves. Dubai is a very international city, and you can see investors from all over the globe. In the crisis period there was an influx of European investors due to the strong euro and Dubai's connectivity. With the crisis there has been a reduction in the influx from the West and more coming from the East. That is all because of the global economy. Dubai reflects the global economic conjuncture.</p><h4>What reflections will the so-called Arab spring have on Dubai's economy?</h4><p>I always look at things with a glass-half-full attitude. The Arab spring will benefit Dubai's economy. The countries that have undergone change will slowly have to start providing their citizens with more infrastructure and more economic freedom, which will translate into more business with Dubai. Dubai is the economic hub of the region, and any serious player has to consider having a presence in Dubai. This cosmopolitan environment provides both hard and soft infrastructure, including a strong legal framework and positive human resources. The Arab spring, in that respect, will contribute to our growth.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the rest of 2011? Going into 2012, how do you see the trends changing?</h4><p>With the political events going on in Europe and the US, there is no cohesion like we were seeing in 2008, when the crisis first hit. Then, there was cohesion between institutions and governments. Today, the problem is bigger than the one we faced in 2008 due to a lack of collective will and collaboration. Short-term, selfish approaches cannot get us out of this situation.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2011</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You began your airport retailing career at Shannon Airport, which was the first duty free retailer in the world. As Executive Vice-Chairman of what is now one of the largest airport retailers in the world, what can you say about the development of the duty free industry?</h4><p>The duty free industry was born in Shannon in 1947, because that was the first refueling stop for flights crossing the Atlantic and going on to Europe. In the first year the industry brought in something like $20,000, and today the industry is worth $40 billion. Half of that money comes from airport operations, the other half comes from border shops, cruise liners, and the like. The governments in Dubai and Ireland entered into a six-month contract in 1983, and a team of people was sent here to set up Dubai Duty Free. I was part of that 10-man team. The plan was to write a procedural manual, set up the operation, and then leave. During that time myself and a couple of other people were asked if we would stay on here, and we agreed to stay for two years, and we're still here 28 years on. We started with 100 staff, and we still have 52 of those 100 staff working for us. In total now we have 4,000 staff working for us. In the first full year of business in 1984, we had sales of $20 million. In 2011 we had sales of $1.46 billion, and we are the single biggest airport retailer. That has been helped along the way by the fact we have been growing, our penetration has increased, and of course the traffic through the airport has been increasing. We currently have 51 million people through here yearly, and the projections for 2020 are for this to hit 95 million.</p><h4>The majority of airports lease retailing space. What was your motivation in taking a different approach when establishing Dubai Duty Free?</h4><p>In Dubai we operate all the retail activities at the airport and we have 18,000 sqm of space. We think our model suited Dubai better than the concessionaire approach because 28 years ago Dubai was very small. It needed marketing, it needed promotion, and also it needed input into the community. Dubai Duty Free was one of the first companies in Dubai to take on that marketing role and position Dubai as a growing and important stop-over and destination for international travellers. Our famous advertising strapline of “Fly Buy Dubai" and our tentative steps into sports marketing way back in the 1980s helped raise the profile of Dubai, the airport, and, of course, the duty free operations. Our model has also worked extremely well for the development of the airport, and we work closely with Dubai Airports and other stakeholders on rolling out development plans. Concessionaires would not have the same overall objectives that we have, such as the long-term promotion of Dubai or the setting up of a charity foundation that we established in 2004. We think that our model has been successful and it has worked out better than the alternative would have done. Around 75% of everything we sell we buy from local suppliers and distributors, many of whom were the original shop owners at the airport. So from the point of view of the Dubai economy, our contribution is significant. Although we buy everything locally and can get speedy deliveries, we still need to have a logistics and distribution center here which covers 27,000 sqm. The handling of our stock is 70% automated, otherwise we couldn't cope with the quantity of stock that we deal with. We sold 17 million pieces of merchandise in 2011. In November we did 62,000 transactions every day at our points of sale. That's fairly average for us. We deliver between 500 and 1,000 pallets to the duty free area every day from here, all of which are shrink-wrapped, x-rayed, secured, put into sealed trucks, and delivered.</p><div class="quote">“The duty free industry in the Middle East is worth about $3 billion a year, and we account for half of that."</div><h4>Dubai Duty Free invests a huge amount in developing infrastructure. What challenges does the business face in this respect and what further developments are underway?</h4><p>We invest a lot in Dubai. We built a head office, where we have 6,000 sqm of space. In addition to this, we have a 27,000-sqm distribution center. We are in the process of finalizing a five-star hotel here in Dubai that will be managed by Jumeirah Hotels. We're owned by the government, but we are given a great deal of freedom to make our own commercial decisions. I am very privileged to report directly to HH Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, who is the President of the Dubai Civil Aviation Authority and Chairman of Dubai Duty Free. His Highness is also the head of Emirates Group, and heads up several important entities here. He is a fantastic boss to have and has always been incredibly supportive of our operations.</p><h4>According to a recent report, Dubai is now competing head-to-head with London as the most popular retail city in the world. Are the new malls here proving to be stiff competition for Dubai Duty Free?</h4><p>It's healthy competition. I think the development of the retail sector, including the development of the duty free industry around the Middle East, is good. When we came here a lot of suppliers didn't know where Dubai was, and then we began to grow and other airports in the region began to open and develop very good operations. That regional competition has helped us with the suppliers in the duty free industry to take more notice of the region. The duty free industry in the Middle East is worth about $3 billion a year, and we account for half of that. A lot of suppliers have set up regional offices here, and they do exclusive promotions with us. So from the duty free industry point of view, competition is good. I think from the downtown retail perspective, Dubai's malls serve as a fantastic attraction to visitors, and we welcome that fact as it increases traffic at the airport and our own operation. Of course, we have to constantly review our products and prices in relation to downtown retailers, but overall we offer great value.</p><h4>What are some of the challenges facing the industry today?</h4><p>It's a very vibrant and adaptable industry generally. We run into certain problems, for example airport security, which created a problem in time delays at certain airports. And the restrictions on carry-on luggage introduced by certain carriers caused issues for us. For many years there have been ongoing discussions by the World Health Organization (WHO) about stopping the sale of cigarettes in the duty free industry. That hasn't happened, and it may never happen, but there is a lobby there to make it happen. The duty free industry now requires that cigarettes carry health warnings, and this was not the case before. While perhaps a positive move, it may have consequences for the duty free industry worldwide.</p><h4>How did the global liquidity crisis affect your operations, and how far has the industry recovered?</h4><p>During the recession, traffic continued to increase at the airport and the duty free business continued to grow. If we take the last three years; in 2009 our business was up 3% on the previous year; the next year it was up 14%; and in 2011 our sales were up 15.7% on the previous year. How we do this is to focus on increasing our penetration levels, which are currently around 50%, and try to drive up the average amount spent per departing passenger, which is currently around $49. If you take the average penetration for most duty free stores, they sell to about 20% of departing passengers. We are well positioned and centrally located in all of the terminals, and that is obviously a great advantage and comes from our close working relationship with Dubai Airports and other stakeholders. Also, we make sure that our staff are well trained and motivated. And, we continue to offer good value. The recession, therefore, didn't hit us too badly.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>DUBAL celebrated its 30th anniversary in 2009 and is one of the flagship industrial powerhouses in the UAE. What developments has DUBAL witnessed in the Dubai industrial sector over the last three decades, and what factors have been instrumental to its success?</h4><p>The industrial sector in Dubai in particular has become very attractive, and extremely solid. The aluminum industry is the biggest non-oil industry in the UAE today. Aluminum is a commodity, and banks are using metal as a reserve, even as an investment. We currently sell to almost 300 customers worldwide in about 45 countries on six continents. We produce products in three main forms: extrusion billets, foundry alloys, and high-purity aluminum. We are focusing on four different sectors: construction, packaging, transportation, and also now aerospace. Ten years ago, we accounted for 7% to 9% of the industrial sector. This has changed slightly with a lot of new companies now contributing to Dubai's GDP. Today we are producing 1,026,000 tons—10% of our production is used locally, while 90% is exported. When 90% of your production is exported, you need good facilities, good transportation, and a good port to handle 900,000 tons of metal exports. We are very fortunate to have DP World, which has contributed to DUBAL's success because of the technology and services that it provides. We, in turn, contribute to its income—about 25% of DP World's income comes from DUBAL, through transportation and handling, plus storage, because we store our products at its facilities. From there we also supply five to six downstream destinations in the UAE. We work closely with downstream businesses in the UAE, and have been doing so successfully for the last 33 years.</p><h4>Which are the key markets for you, and where are you witnessing increased growth and demand on a global level?</h4><p>In the 1980s, we used to sell 80% of our product to Asia. However, after the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s, we shifted our focus to other parts of the world. Asia and Southeast Asia nevertheless remain important markets for us. The Moroccan, Tunisian, and Egyptian markets are important also, as well as the Syrian, Jordanian, and Lebanese markets. About 17% of our total production is sold to Europe and that is an important market—not so much from a revenue perspective, but from a strategic one. In Europe, a 6% tariff is applied to all of our products and this duty has been imposed for almost 15 years. When this tariff is reduced, the market will become far more lucrative for us. The newest market for us today would be South America. We started selling there last year, with 10,000 tons being shipped to that market. We aim to sell 25,000 tons there in 2012. By 2015, we expect to sell more than 50,000 tons to South America, mainly in Brazil, Chile, and Venezuela.</p><div class="quote">“The newest market for us today would be South America."</div><h4>How was the price of aluminum affected during the global crisis period? Did it impact on you heavily?</h4><p>Before the crisis, aluminum prices were close to record highs. During the crisis, prices dropped to close on $1,300 US per ton. Despite this, 2009 was a good year for DUBAL as we adopted a different strategy to the other players. While many companies cut production, made staffing cutbacks, froze salaries, stopped projects, and stopped supplying certain customers, we did the opposite. We actually increased our production and we continued with our capex projects. The most important thing to DUBAL is our people, and we ensured that no one would be laid off. Throughout the crisis period we invested in our people and we invested in our companies. We have people from over 45 nationalities working for us, and we pride ourselves on our international and highly skilled workforce.</p><h4>In 2007 you entered into a joint venture with Mubadalla to create Emirates Aluminium Company, and together you launched the EMAL Project. What were the strategic motivations behind that move, and can you tell us a little bit more about the project and other projects you have ongoing at the moment?</h4><p>In 2005 we saw the potential to utilize our business model. After 25 years of growth DUBAL had a great deal of potential in terms of people, labor experience, and technology. In 2006, Abu Dhabi officials expressed an interest in aluminum production, because they had the energy, the site, and the desire to diversify the economy from oil into industry. Also, they wanted to build a downstream industry plus sub-downstream businesses. Being a large manufacturer of aircraft maintenance items, aluminum production made sense. We teamed our interests and by 2020 are planning to produce close to 2.5 million tons from both companies. Synergies are now being studied between DUBAL and EMAL in terms of sales purchasing, training, and equipment; and we are trying to optimize as much as we can. EMAL Phase I was completed at the end of 2010 and produced 724,000 tons in 2011, which DUBAL has successfully sold. EMAL now has 200 customers in 30 countries. EMAL Phase II has just started. This will take the total production capacity of EMAL to 1.3 million tons, using technology that was developed by DUBAL here in the UAE.</p><h4>Turkey is one of your target destinations. What makes Turkey so attractive to you?</h4><p>Turkey is a very big market, close to us, and we believe that the aluminum industry in Turkey is booming. It is a very encouraging market as we don't face restrictive trade tariffs. We have started selling more products to Turkey, and once we are fully comfortable with the Turkish market we may invest in additional technologies. Currently, we sell only one product to Turkey: foundry alloys. Our Turkish customers used to buy 25,000 tons per year, but are now taking up to 75,000 tons. We sell our products to larger car manufacturers and are able to provide the quality of backup support that such companies require. We are also looking into extrusions in Turkey. As the extrusion plants are scattered around Turkey, the logistics are difficult, and so we are working with an agent to find the best way to reach these extruders. We would like to sell through Turkey to other countries close by, using Turkey as a hub.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the background of GE's operations in the region, and what role does Dubai play in the region?</h4><p>GE has been in the region for over 80 years. We started operations by supporting the oil and gas sector in power generation. People know us as what we used to be, an appliance company. There is a lot that the Middle East region has had to offer, particularly Dubai. Over the years we have found new ways to strengthen our relationships and partnerships. Just look at the region's growth—over the last 30 years, Dubai has transformed dramatically. Though it has limited natural resources, the city wanted to monetize these resources for infrastructure development. First, Dubai built a very strong infrastructure network to help improve people's lives with electricity, clean water, and transportation systems. Second, Dubai used this monetization to build a good healthcare and education system. Third, Dubai knew that its energy resources were limited and it wanted to diversify its economy industrially. Finally, Dubai wanted to stimulate tourism by offering many support systems. GE also has strong business functions as an oil and gas company, and we were in a position to help monetize the region's natural resources. We're a power generation company, a water company, and a transportation company with aviation and even rail. We're also a healthcare company. Basically, GE is an industrial company. Until recently we were also in the media sector with NBC Universal, and we are now in partnership with Comcast. Dubai's vision and what GE has to offer matches perfectly. That's why we increased our presence to suit the region's needs. Today's leaders see us as a partner that can help them achieve goals in every sector. They see us as a part of their vision, just as they have seen a GE refrigerator as a reliable and integral part of the home. We recently set up our headquarters in Dubai so that we could better cover the Middle East, North Africa, Turkey, and Pakistan.</p><h4>Although GE has been in the region for 80 years, the market is still considered to have huge growth potential. What changes have you witnessed in your seven years in this position?</h4><p>The first time I came to Dubai was in 1976. I came to visit my father who was working here. I remember the four-hour journey from Abu Dhabi to Dubai. Today, if you take the same road, it boasts multiple lanes each way and the journey takes just an hour and 15 minutes. It has been very fascinating to see the infrastructure grow. The education and healthcare systems have also seen great improvements. Dubai has become a hub for people to fly from Latin America to Japan due to the strength of the national airlines. I was among 30 international business representatives who were invited to His Highness' palace. He sat down with us and asked us what help we needed to grow, and what issues we were facing. This, over the years, has helped to break down bureaucracy and get things moving more quickly. The fundamentals continue to be important in Dubai, and that will keep it going strong.</p><div class="quote">“Power generation and the industrialization of Dubai offer exciting opportunities."</div><h4>You've been very involved in infrastructure development from the ground up. What is in progress now that's exciting for you?</h4><p>Power generation and the industrialization of Dubai offer exciting opportunities. We have three facilities for water, oil and gas, and energy. We also have a wastewater treatment facility.  All these facilities use advanced GE equipment. Not only are we participating in power generation, but we're also providing clean and environmentally efficient water. We re-use the water, both for industry and waste. We are improving the health of the people and the quality and cost of health care. In the aviation sector, Emirates is among GE's largest customers. We lease aircraft, sell engines, and we have built a training facility. We have been working very closely with the Dubai Executive Council in the energy sector to make operations more efficient.</p><h4>How would you assess the potential for the green technology sector in general?</h4><p>There is a lot more that can be done to enhance energy efficiency. Technology can help drive efficiency and promote renewable energy, as well as promote water re-use. These are areas that require investment. Additionally, attention should be given to solar energy, wind technology, and possibly offshore wind farms that could be helpful for power generation. Integrated Gasification Combined-Cycle (IGCC) technology can be applied to industries, while nuclear power is another growth area. Furthermore, smart grids, smart meters, and technology can be applied via satellite. Currently, a breakdown of domestic power use reveals that 60% is utilized for air conditioning, 20% for lighting, and 20% for appliances. There is a lot that can be done in each of these sectors to improve energy use efficiency.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2012 and the ongoing recovery from the financial crisis?</h4><p>The volatility in the region is manageable if you are part of the fabric, but the question is timing. In 2012 there is a huge opportunity for growth in the region because of the fundamentals: better living standards, 24-hour electricity, clean water, good health care, good education, job creation, and a diversified economy. These are the same fundamentals that attracted us to the region and now they are even stronger. That's why this region is important and I see a lot more opportunity in 2012.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Byblos Bank has a growing presence around the region. How is the bank looking to expand its presence overseas, and what are the key signals you follow in establishing international operations?</h4><p>The Byblos Bank Group has a direct presence in Iraq, Syria, Sudan, the UAE, Nigeria, Armenia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, as well as in Belgium, France, the UK, and Cyprus through fully owned subsidiaries, branches, or representative offices. Byblos is targeting domestic and regional inorganic expansion should there be any attractively priced targets. Byblos would like to increase its market share in Lebanon to 15% from 10% currently, as well as continue expanding into markets with low lending penetration and high potential.</p><p>In 2010, we increased our branch network in Lebanon, Iraq, Sudan, and Syria, and entered our 11th overseas market by acquiring a bank in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We also attracted two illustrious new names to our list of shareholders: the International Financial Corporation, which is the private sector arm of the World Bank Group; and PROPARCO, the private sector arm of the French government's Agence Française de Développement. In parallel, Byblos Bank continued to build a liquidity profile that independent analysts rank among the very best in the global financial industry.</p><h4>Are you looking to expand your branch network locally? Which areas of the market are your new branches looking to target?</h4><p>Byblos Bank has 78 branches in Lebanon, which constitutes the largest branch network of any bank in the country. Byblos has recently opened branches in rural areas that are underserved by banks in order to meet the growing financing needs of these areas as well as to support the economic development of these regions and contain migration to the cities. As in all of our branches, we look to serve SMEs as well as the retail and trade segments.</p><div class="quote">“In 2010, we increased our branch network in Lebanon, Iraq, Sudan, and Syria, and entered our 11th overseas market."</div><h4>During the global financial crisis the Lebanese banking sector was seen by many as a “safe harbor" for deposits. What do you think are some of the reasons why Lebanon's banks are considered reliable partners in the global financial industry?</h4><p>The banking sector remains the backbone of the Lebanese economy, and is profitable, highly liquid, and well capitalized, unlike many banking sectors in advanced and emerging economies. Bank assets are equivalent to about 334% of GDP and deposits equivalent to 274% of GDP at the end of 2010, among the highest such ratios in the world. The banks continue to compete aggressively for corporate and retail clients domestically, while the sector continues its asset diversification strategy by expanding regionally and into emerging markets. The sector has shown its resilience to global financial shocks and proved it can finance the private sector while supporting the public sector needs, at a time when governments around the world have been forced to bail out their banking systems. A main characteristic of Lebanese banks is their sound, experienced, and conservative management, which has helped banks adjust to domestic and external turmoil. So it was not surprising for the Lebanese banking sector to avoid the structured financial products that brought down some of the biggest global financial institutions. As a result, trust in Lebanese banks increased even more during the global financial crisis, which led to massive deposit inflows into the sector. In addition, Lebanese banks will overcome the turmoil in the MENA region, and will not be significantly affected by ongoing developments across the Arab world.</p><h4>Do non-performing loans (NPLs) represent a major problem in the local banking sector, and what is your bank doing to keep an eye on NPL growth?</h4><p>Byblos Bank continues to build the quality of its already sound loan portfolio in a number of ways, including a very high coverage ratio of NPLs (by specific, general, and collective provisions and reserved interest) of 154.94% as at end-March 2011. In addition, Byblos Bank continues to show a decreasing trend in the ratio of NPLs to total loans, recording a figure of 2.32% at end-March 2011, down from 2.42% at end-December 2010.</p><h4>What is your economic outlook for Lebanon over the medium term?</h4><p>The Lebanese economy grew by an average of 8.4% during the past three years due to domestic political stability, massive capital inflows, and a favorable global and regional environment. However, the Lebanese authorities missed a major opportunity to implement reforms during this period, which would have put growth on a sustainable path. Right now, 2011 looks to be challenging, given the convergence of domestic political uncertainties and regional instability, and growth estimates range between 2% and 3%. However, reforms remain essential to improve Lebanon's economic outlook over the medium term. The new Lebanese government has its work cut out for it on the economic and financial levels. First, it has to put economic and financial issues at the top of its agenda, and take political decisions to serve these priorities. Second, it has to restore consumer and investor confidence after uncertainty and political tensions over several months negatively affected confidence. Third, it has to pass the 2010 and 2011 budgets, given that we haven't had a budget ratified since 2005 and that the recent budgets have been blocked by political infighting. Fourth, it has to commit to implement structural, financial, administrative, and legal reforms that have been on hold for many years. Fifth, these reforms have to lead to reducing the government's borrowing needs in order to put the fiscal and debt levels on a sustainable path. Sixth, it has to improve the investment climate and the business environment in order to improve the competitiveness of the Lebanese economy, which would help create jobs.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does freedom of the press and expression in Lebanon compare with countries in the region? How has the Lebanese press performed in responding to and covering the Arab spring?</h4><p>Beirut has a vibrant media community with relatively high principles and is free from state control. The country is an exception compared to its Arab neighbors in terms of pluralism of the press and broad range of readers. However, the Lebanese press along with the Arab and Western media has been selective in its coverage of the Arab spring. Each one has its own agenda when it comes to the Arab revolutions. Only the new electronic social media such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube are credited with sparking and fanning the flames of the Arab revolutions and making a difference.</p><h4>What trends have you noticed in the Lebanese market in recent years?</h4><p>After a slowdown in 2005 and 2006, advertising spending in Lebanon has been growing—with 2010 a record year, exceeding all expectations despite fears of the global financial crisis affecting local spending. Although there is a general trend of summer dips and high clutter toward the end of the year, spending habits are slightly changing to peak around special events like Ramadan and Christmas. The advertising trends in Lebanon are theme-centered; brands go where the consumers' consumption patterns are headed for the season.</p><h4>What have been the main sources of income?</h4><p>Our success centers on three fundamental key factors to best serve our advertisers and readers: developing local content, circulation based on subscription, and advertising sales. In Al-Balad Beirut, most of our revenues are generated from advertising and copy sale—40% copy sales mainly home subscriptions rather than point of sale, and 60% from advertising; this is our competitive edge over other dailies. The high market penetration and circulation rates indicate that the company's strategic approach has thus far been a success. For instance, with 20 million weekly readers, Al Waseet is currently the only regional publication offering such wide coverage, with a cumulative market penetration of 77%. Although we still face competition in many markets, we remain nonetheless leaders in our category.</p><div class="quote">“Our success centers on three fundamental key factors to best serve our advertisers and readers: developing local content, circulation based on subscription, and advertising sales."</div><h4>How much of your expansion will be based on franchising, and how much from official branches?</h4><p>Franchising as a sustainable business strategy depends primarily on Al Waseet International's (AWI's) performance in the  media-advertising sector. The company is now able to detail business processes from marketing protocols to distribution methodologies. We have always explored franchising, even though most of our expansion is based on true ownership. Nevertheless, we are considering corporate investments to further expand our business models and brands.</p><h4>What is the significance of your deal with TIME Inc. to launch Fortune Arabia?</h4><p>Time Inc., over the past 80 years, has worked really hard to build a brand all over the world, and therefore chooses its local partners via a careful selection process. The process is implemented for all their licensees, which involves a pitch between several publishing firms. AWI was chosen because of the unique business model that it represents and the in-depth search for content excellence and credible news. Our deal consists of a long partnership over seven years to launch Time Inc. brands in the region, and we have started with Fortune in the UAE and Kuwait and they will be followed by Saudi Arabia, the Levant region, Qatar, Bahrain, and Egypt. Fortune Arabia is a mix between the premium international content of Fortune US and local content developed for and from the region. The objective is to publish an international title with local input and understanding written by local editors from the region who value the traditions and culture of the area. In past decades we have witnessed a change in the Middle East, with a clear tendency toward a corporate environment from family-owned or managed groups. This atmosphere represents a perfect surrounding for Fortune as it is directly linked with transparency and a more competitive atmosphere.</p><h4>What innovations in the print media business model do you believe are needed in the age of the internet?</h4><p>The online scene has created a new reality for the advertising world. In September 2010, we entered into a co-marketing agreement with Google whereby Waseet and Waseet.net offer their customers, in the MENA region, Google AdWords vouchers. We have always monitored market dynamics when introducing new products and solutions. Today there is reason to believe that the online advertising industry holds a lot of potential with a current global market size. This is why we are also planning to invest in some digital online properties related to strengthening and expanding the presence of our media across a market with a lot of potential.</p><h4>What projects or acquisitions are in the pipeline for AWI?</h4><p>There are many projects in the pipeline in different sectors and in different countries. With AWI's experience and successful international expansion, no company is more fit to establish a lucrative business model that can be emulated and operated profitably anywhere in the world. Franchising, therefore, makes a lot of sense for AWI and has become a crucial step in the company's  ongoing development. It will undoubtedly take the AWI business model to the next level.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the state of the local real estate market? Is the boom in prices fading?<br></h4><p>By no means or stretch of the imagination has Lebanon ever boomed in anything. All the industries that built this economy are quite sporadic and cyclical. Yes, we put in a great performance in 2010, but what we need to do is look five years ahead—not five months. The last 10 years indicate a 7% y-o-y increase, and this is healthy growth. However, in 2005, 2006, and 2008 there were severe drops in the market. Having said that, people eventually need places to live and that does feed through the system in the end.</p><h4>What areas represent the lion's share of the real estate market?</h4><div class="quote">“During 2010 we had our best year with permits for almost 22,000 units."</div><p>The province of Mount Lebanon, which consists of seven districts, makes up 55% of the market and population. It is the most cosmopolitan area of Lebanon and contains the largest labor pool and the most extensive industry. It starts at the seashore and ends in the Bekaa. Investment, however, is very focused on Beirut, and this is only representative of 9% of the market. Having said that, we are currently developing a mega project called Cascada Village in the Bekaa Valley. It is a 200,000 sqm development and will be a one-stop leisure destination, combining retail shopping, entertainment, dining, event hosting, business servicing, and outdoor touristic attractions amid beautiful landscapes. It is close to both Beirut and Damascus, and addresses the needs of both Lebanese residents and foreign visitors.</p><h4>What is the demand for housing units and who is buying?</h4><p>The required residential units per year for the Lebanese population is approximately 30,000. During 2010 we had our best year with permits for almost 22,000 units. Also, in 2010 the total number of real estate transactions was 94,000—85% representing the residential market. Approximately 77% of those apartments sold were of values below $200,000. That takes away from the concept that it's a luxury market. Once you size the market you try to decide who is buying and where their income is coming from. The majority of buyers are Lebanese returning from abroad, especially from the GCC, who then get married and require housing.</p><h4>What is your evaluation of the commercial market?</h4><p>The drive for residential development has left gaps in other areas. In that respect, we have decided to promote the commercial side of our business. The commercial segment does not even exceed 5% of the total size of the market yet, and so we have been working hard to produce reports and open the eyes of developers and investors. Lebanon is developing as a real investment destination, with plenty of foreign companies, NGOs, and embassies looking to locate here. In that regard, there is a real need for commercial space. Universities are also creating a need for student housing, and are working to build dormitories and furnished apartments. The private sector is happy to step in and rent that property.</p><h4>How else are you developing outside of Beirut?</h4><p>If stability can be maintained, then this country will see an influx of people, especially tourists. Currently, tourism is focused on Beirut, yet Lebanon has so much more on offer, including eco-tourism, faith tourism, and much more. These areas are not getting the attention they deserve. To develop the regions further in terms of tourism potential sufficient shopping centers, hotels, lakeside attractions, dining facilities, entertainment venues, and mega retail stores must be present, and this is an area we are involved in heavily. We have been advising and consulting our investors to ensure long-term profits on this.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the Lebanese banking sector been able to transfer its success in the domestic market to the international sphere?</h4><p>The Lebanese banking system is no stranger to international competition, having had foreign and Arab banks in its midst since before the country's inception. This proved to be a valuable learning experience for Lebanon's domestic banks, an experience that was augmented by the lessons learned operating under tough political, economic, and security conditions during the Lebanese civil war of 1975-1991, and which taught Lebanese banks the virtues of being cautious and conservative. After the end of the war, Lebanese banks did not stand still. They first developed their services to surpass those of strictly commercial banking to areas encompassing private investment and Islamic banking, in addition to asset management, brokerage, and insurance services. Secondly, they embarked a few years ago on a process of foreign expansion, especially in regional markets. Given the operating background and the increasing sophistication of Lebanese banks, this process proved to be highly successful, made easier by the fact that Lebanese banks could replicate the success they have had in their domestic market to nearby markets with a similar culture and language. This certainly has been true of BLOM Bank, which is the leader in retail banking in Lebanon, and now is the number one bank in car loans in Jordan and is among the top retail banks in Syria and Egypt. BLOM Bank also has had tremendous success in asset management, having launched mutual funds in Lebanon, and then in Egypt and Jordan, and soon in Saudi Arabia. To note, BLOM Bank currently operates in 12 countries—Lebanon, Syria, Egypt, Jordan, the UAE, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, France, Switzerland, England, Cyprus, and Romania—providing universal banking services through more than 155 banking and financial units in these countries. Other Lebanese banks have had similar experiences. In that regard, the major banks in Lebanon have developed enough to not only be successful in the local market, but also to move their success to nearby markets.</p><h4>Do you think that Beirut is slowly re-evolving into a financial capital for the Middle East and Mediterranean region?</h4><p>It is difficult to go as far as to say that it is becoming a major financial capital right now, as certain security and stability issues remain. The banks have, yes, been successful in going abroad, and the system here has definitely proven to be strong and resilient, but challenges remain. When the political and security situations stabilize, I believe Beirut can regain its role as a major center in the region.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the policy settings of the Banque du Liban (BDL), which have been labeled as highly conservative?</h4><p>I think the line the BDL is taking is right, and it has to be conservative. It has kept the Lebanese banking system immune from the international financial crisis by prohibiting investments in complex, “highly rated," yet highly risky investments. It has also kept it well capitalized, liquid, and with little leverage. Although Lebanese banks operating abroad follow the regulations of their host countries' central banks, they have largely adopted the conservative strategies nurtured by BDL regulations, which proved very effective in sparing Lebanese banks the economic upheavals seen in places like the UAE and the current political upheavals in Syria and Egypt. BDL regulations have also enabled Lebanon to avoid a real estate bubble. This is because banks cannot provide credit above 60% of the value of a project, with 40% demanded from shareholders. At BLOM Bank we rarely provide more than 50%. This is to protect the bank from downturns and against becoming over-leveraged. To sum up, the prudence of BDL regulations put in place have really proven to be beneficial in protecting the banking system, and we are lucky to be operating within this environment. This banking management culture has really helped. In addition, there is a strong level of coordination between the BDL and the Association of Banks in Lebanon. Before regulations are issued, they are sent to the Association of Banks for review, and we can suggest changes. In addition to strong regulations from the BDL, we also undergo monitoring from the Banking Control Commission (BCC). Monitoring occurs onsite and offsite, and reports are also submitted. There are also regular high-level meetings between chairmen, general managers, and BCC officers regarding our strategies and plans.</p><div class="quote">“I believe Beirut can regain its role as a major center in the region."</div><h4>What levels of growth have been observed in the mortgage sector?</h4><p>Housing loans have grown considerably, increasing by 40% in 2010, and currently are close to $4 billion out of a total loan portfolio of $36.8 billion at Lebanese banks. The mortgage sector has been helped by BDL directives that exempt banks from keeping required reserves equal in amount to new loans extended in Lebanese pounds (100% of required reserves in the case of subsidized loans, 60% otherwise). In fact, the exemption relates to all new loans extended to productive sectors in the economy (industry, agriculture, tourism, education, and the environment), not just housing—a policy that has helped credit provided to the private sector to increase by an average of more than 20% in the last two years.</p><h4>There has been an incredible amount of capital inflows over the last few years. What do you do with this excess liquidity?</h4><p>It is a way to encourage and grow the economy. For the past few years, there have been hardly any increases in government spending in Lebanon, since that would cause deficits to increase further and debts to spiral. In a way, the economy grew strongly over 2008-2010 at about 8% annually mostly because of increases in consumer and private investment spending powered by the available liquidity, unlike in other countries, where most of the growth came from fiscal stimulus.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of Al-Akhbar?<br></h4><p>Akhbar Beirut is the publishing house of Al-Akhbar, a Lebanese newspaper, the first issue of which went to market on July 14, 2006. In five years Al-Akhbar has become a reference newspaper on the Lebanese market, tag tailing long established institutions such as As-Safir and An-Nahar. Launched by the late Joseph Samaha, an outstanding Arab journalist, and myself, the newspaper gathered a team of young journalists from all walks of life. Its internet readership has made it a firm market leader in terms of readership.</p><h4>How has the newspaper been involved in Lebanon's development and growth over the past two decades?</h4><p>Al-Akhbar was launched in 2006. People who work at the paper used to work at other publications such as Al-Hayat, As-Safir, and An-Nahar. They played a role in following developments in Lebanon after the end of the civil war in 1990. Most were perhaps inclined to oppose the late Rafic Hariri's chaotic economic policy that led to a series of mistakes due to a policy of impunity toward militias and the leaders of Lebanon's various sects. But, more importantly, despite Al-Akhbar's preoccupation in the past few years with the political and security situation in the country, the paper was able to resume discussions over Lebanon's economic role from a critical point of view.</p><h4>What is the current circulation of Al-Akhbar and what are its main channels of distribution?</h4><p>A total of 15,500 copies are distributed daily across the different communities. Al-Akhbar is on offer at 1,325 points of sales all over the country, with an average of 5,500 copies sold per day. We currently have 8,350 paid subscriptions delivered directly to our subscribers, from which 1,500 are split between airlines and free subscriptions, and the circulation continues to grow by the day.</p><div class="quote">“The English edition of the website was launched during the month of August 2011."</div><h4>How has Al-Akhbar sought to build up its regional and international profile as a newspaper of record?</h4><p>There are a lot of professional journalists here who have spent more than 30 years working at big firms. They then transferred their experience, credibility, and reputation to this establishment. The newspaper itself broke the tradition of working with the authorities. This tradition is famous in the Arab world, where journalism is closely connected to the political, economic, security, and religious authorities. Al-Akhbar overcame it all, through its wide margin, which enabled it to address topics and issues that were previously forbidden. Also, it enabled it to express itself clearly, and without courtesy, and this made it quickly popular. In  addition to this, Al-Akhbar represented a clear opinion regarding the sharp general division in Lebanon and the Arab world. It was able to occupy a leading position for a large audience in addition to decision-making circles, and all those who think that what Al-Akhbar is doing is beyond traditional journalism.</p><h4>Al-Akhbar has made an effort to enlighten people on topics not covered by other media outlets. What are some of the core issues that the newspaper has covered that have made a real difference in Lebanon?</h4><p>Perhaps one of these cases is the exclusivity agreement with Wikileaks to publish thousands of cables issued by US embassies in several Arabic and international capitals. This has allowed a lot of interactivity. For example, it is well known that Tunisia faced political turmoil before the protests. When Al-Akhbar published the cables related to Tunisia, a lot of discussions took place. The same thing went for Egypt, Libya, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia, in addition to the secrets of the last Israeli war on Lebanon in 2006. Al-Akhbar also provided a new model regarding cultural journalism, away from this field's dullness and routine. It provided a platform for young potential journalists inside and outside Lebanon.</p><h4>How is Lebanon considered an example for countries in the region in terms of freedom of expression in the media and in the public at large? What are some of the key strengths underpinning Lebanon's freedom of speech?</h4><p>There's both a constitutional and cultural strength that underpins freedom of speech in Lebanon. The Lebanese constitution protects freedom of speech, and Lebanon is one of very few Arab countries that does not practice any form of internet filtering. Unlike what is common in other Arab countries, citizens are very rarely arrested or called in for questioning because of an expressed opinion—slander and libel notwithstanding. Also, what is important is that there's an active citizenry, in the sense that civil rights activists and journalists mobilize whenever there's an attempt to stifle this freedom, as was the case with the new internet law proposal put forth in 2010.</p><h4>Lebanon is still considered one of the centers of news and journalism in the Arab world. Despite the competition of rivals such as Dubai, what are the key strengths behind Lebanon's success in the media?</h4><p>Freedom. You can never reach the maximum in your creativity if your freedom is stifled. There is also an old heritage in the press and journalism, dating back to even before Lebanon's independence.</p><h4>How has Al-Akhbar been able to adjust its operations with the advancement of new technologies such as the internet?</h4><p>We try very hard to adapt to new technologies, and sometimes we succeed and sometimes we fail. It is not easy. It is not easy to change a workflow and a general mentality that thinks of paper as the predominant form and internet as a secondary channel, to fully accepting the importance of the internet and convergent forms of media production and collaboration. That said, we have from the very beginning tried to be leaders in the Lebanese media space specifically and the Arab world in general in trying to move the website from being an online “re-print" of the print edition, to offering web-specific content and news throughout the day. We also gradually migrated out of the more traditional form of the “issue," in which print content is dumped on the web at a specific time, and rather publish the articles as soon as they become available. We also offer photo albums, embed rich media content such as video and audio, and regularly publish interactive info-maps.</p><h4>In what areas of the media is the company looking to expand into?</h4><p>We have been focusing on launching different supplements and frequent polls on various subjects. Our website is developing many features. Lately, we've been working on a unique website advertising policy based on video, full page, or article inserts. Furthermore a 40-page newspaper will be launched very soon. The English edition of the website was launched during the month of August 2011. The site aims to make debates and analyses circulating in the Arabic media sphere accessible to English speakers worldwide. It will also feature original content of opinion, analysis, and field stories as well as photo blogs chronicling the latest developments across the Middle East. Monthly economic and social magazines will be published in Lebanon and the Gulf area starting from October 2011, and lately we have started working on a market study in order to study the opportunities for launching a French version of Al-Akhbar newspaper.</p><h4>What are some of the key topics that you see affecting Lebanon over the coming years?</h4><p>Theoretically, Lebanon is an independent country, but is located in a big attraction field in the region, and many Lebanese people live or work outside of it. It is in contact with Israel, which means it is special in every aspect, and has always been affected by what happens around it and worldwide. Today, Lebanon is waiting for the scene in the Arab world to become clearer after the revolutions, especially in Syria. Yet, an additional threat is going to be an expected Israeli war on Lebanon soon. This threatens Lebanon's capabilities and economy, and affects its configuration and political situation. The other side is related to the international economic crises, especially that the Lebanese economy isn't independent, but directly and strongly related to what is happening around it.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has H.E.C transformed from being a small family company to becoming a multinational in the course of a generation?<br></h4><p>The company was established in 1959 by my father and uncle. They were previously involved in a small leather business. When their father died, they moved to Beirut, opened a small grocery shop and it developed from there. They saved some money and ventured with a couple of landowners and started construction projects. In brief, more than 80 buildings, two hotels, and several companies in the Gulf area were developed. In 2003 I moved back to Lebanon and took over the business. As the second generation, we started reorganizing the different fields we worked in and turned the company into a holding company—H.E.C Holding. During the 2006 war, we ventured into the surrounding Middle East. Our name is a source of pride. For the last 53 years we've inherited an excellent name known for fulfilling its promises, which has helped us to grow dramatically in the last few years.</p><h4>Can you tell us about your holding structure and your subsidiaries?</h4><div class="quote">“Our name is a source of pride. For the last 53 years we've inherited an excellent name known for fulfilling its promises."</div><p>H.E.C is the main business through which we buy, invest, and develop land. H.E.C Wood is our manufacturing business. We produce all kinds of high-quality wood products: doors, kitchens, furniture, and so on. We also established H.E.C Trading, one of H.E.C's subsidiaries; it's not an independent company yet. Through H.E.C Trading we import all kinds of products related to development materials. In 2012 we're establishing H.E.C Fitness, which we've been working on for the past six years. It's a fully automated fitness center and the first of its kind. We are working with Oracle as a software company, and Cisco is providing us with a network system and wiring. We are also working on RFID technology with a local firm in collaboration with a French company to provide us with individual identification technology. What we're doing is making a fully automated gym that can analyze your workout by the second. We also provide screens that will be set up at home, and these will be connected to our software.</p><h4>What role does technology play in your business?</h4><p>H.E.C is a technology-oriented developer. We use Cisco for our communication systems and call management, ensuring smooth and secure communications. Furthermore, we run on Oracle, the world's largest business software company, systemizing the whole scope of business; Oracle is the best global business practice solution and is used by the world's top 100 companies. H.E.C further offers potential buyers the “3D Home Builder," a new and exclusive virtual-reality technology for apartment customization. Finally, within H.E.C Wood—our manufacturing company—we use 20-20 Technologies, one of the largest companies in the world offering a single integrated software platform for industry-wide use—from showroom to factory floor—that is tailored specifically to the interior design business and employed across all environments, both desktop and the web.</p><h4>Can you tell us about your latest projects, Green Leaf and Val Verde?</h4><p>The Green Leaf project is built in a prime location in Ain Najem, where its residents can escape the pollution and traffic, as well as enjoy the magnificent view and the greenery that encircles the buildings. It includes double walls, double glazing, and complete electrical, mechanical, and European finishes. Everything needed to make these beautiful homes is perfectly designed to fit their residents' every need. As for the Val Verde project, it is a new residential complex in the heart of Adma, comprising nine fully equipped four-story structures. With a pool, waterfall, green areas, and breathtaking landscapes all around, the residents' homes will become their favorite getaway and the place to be when they want to relax, unwind, and enjoy the beautiful moments of life with their family and friends. Most of our apartments are custom made. What we're trying to do is create a different kind of environment for our clients, not just from a design point of view, but also in terms of lifestyle. We study each client's financial structure. We help them to establish a better financial history during the two years between the pre-sale and the construction to provide them with the best housing loan possible. In order to do that, we worked with BLOM Bank to offer H.E.C Housing Loans.</p><h4>What are the origins of H.E.C Green and H.E.C Heart?</h4><p>H.E.C Green and H.E.C Heart, two non-profit organizations, were established in 2006 following the war. It started as a personal matter. I wasn't really planning to develop it into an organization, but the war affected us deeply. A campaign stated that Lebanon has less than 13% of its green spaces left, and that was the limit for me. I was shocked to think that this is where our kids are going to grow up and eventually live. This is when we started trying to switch to green building, but the more you go green, the more expensive it is. We're trying to work out the balance. With H.E.C Heart, we're helping people—be it victims of war or elderly people. We endeavor to reach out to whoever needs our help. We're trying to make people hopeful again, and happy. We find elderly people who are unsupported and are living a hard life and we help them by giving them better furniture, painting their houses, and providing provisions for the winter, such as food. Our other goal at H.E.C Heart is to help kids. In 2010 we helped cancer patients at the American University of Beirut Hospital. Instead of providing them with money, we brought gifts and some clowns and actors and we provided them all with one carefree and truly joyful day. When you witness this, it's obvious why giving back is important to any company.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Porsche Centre Lebanon developed since your transition to majority shareholder status in 2005?<br></h4><p>The Porsche Centre Lebanon started as a partnership between an automotive company and myself, and I was appointed Managing Partner. In 2005, the company decided to spin off its automotive business, and I ended up acquiring the majority with the addition of two fresh partners. Since the beginning our efforts have been rewarding in Lebanon. In our first year we submitted our business plan to Porsche with the goal of selling 75 cars that year. We ended up selling 135 cars, and we have continued to grow over the years. Our best year ever was 2010, when we sold 360 new cars and 160 pre-owned vehicles through a dedicated pre-owned showroom.</p><h4>Can you tell us about your move into Syria and your expectations for that market?</h4><p>In 2007 Porsche gave us the opportunity to be among the candidates to apply for the Syrian market. In 2008 we were allocated the importation rights as Porsche Centre Syria, which we operate with a Syrian partner and completely independently of Porsche Centre Lebanon. Our best year in Syria was also 2010 with 137 cars sold. Syria is a bigger market than Lebanon, so geographically we must cover a bigger area. We have started with Damascus, the capital and the city with the most purchasing power. We will probably move into other big cities, such as Lattakia or Aleppo. We have drawn up the strategy and we believe that the Syrian market is very promising. We are waiting for the time being for the opportunity to present itself.</p><h4>Coming back to Lebanon, you went from a goal of selling 75 cars in 2002 to selling 360 in 2010. What are the driving forces behind this growing demand?</h4><p>We see two dominant variables. Firstly there is the story of the Lebanese consumer, and secondly there is Porsche's own growth. Regarding the latter, Porsche has grown worldwide from 30,000 to 35,000 cars produced per year in early 2000 to more than 100,000 cars produced in 2011. A lot of this growth has come through the addition of new models and variants. Porsche introduced its first SUV, the Cayenne, in 2002. It has introduced new variants to the 911 and the Boxster as well as two completely new cars: the Cayman in 2006 and the Panamera in 2009. The future continues to look bright. If you read interviews with the top management of Porsche, you can feel that they know where they are going. Their medium-term objective is to produce 150,000 cars annually; by 2018 they are targeting 200,000 cars per year. This has a direct effect on all the markets, and we will certainly grow by the same percentage. Coming back to Lebanon, there is an exceptional consumer profile. We have gone through 30 years of war. During these years many Lebanese sought refuge outside of the country. When these people came back, they brought back different cultures. This added to an existing multi-culturalism stemming from the golden days of Beirut in the 1960s and 1970s. Because of this exposure, the Lebanese have acquired a good perception of luxury products; they have experience in looking for quality, trends, design, power, and performance. This is what typically a connoisseur looks for in a vehicle. Besides just the experience and exposure, there is also a specificity in Lebanese expatriates for their connection to Lebanon. There is definitely a large Lebanese diaspora that is living outside Lebanon that has businesses in Europe, the Arab world, and North America. These people are often very successful, but they maintain strong connections to their families and their native country. They go away and they make money, but very often they repatriate their money or even come back to start businesses, start charities, and buy cars. Many of our clients are people who have been highly successful outside of Lebanon. In this way Lebanon provides solid ground for luxury brands, and Porsche stands tall in our complex market.</p><div class="quote">“Our best year ever was 2010, when we sold 360 new cars and 160 pre-owned vehicles."</div><h4>In that context, which models does the Lebanese consumer prefer?</h4><p>I'm happy to say that Lebanese consumers are a little bit different from their counterparts in the region. In the rest of the Arab world, the Cayenne has significantly contributed to Porsche's sales volumes. Here we have an excellent mix between the bigger cars—the Cayenne and the Panamera—and the sports models. The ratio is about 40% sports cars and 60% the rest. This is due to the high perception of Porsche as a sports car even though the road network in Lebanon was bad until lately. Porsche cars are known to be heavy duty and maintenance free, and are easily an everyday car.</p><h4>In 2010 Porsche began putting hybrids on the market, most notably the Cayenne hybrid. Do you see an increasing demand for this type of vehicle?</h4><p>For the last four or five years Porsche has made it a primary objective to reduce CO2 emissions, build greener engines, and enter the hybrid production market. The Porsche concept of “Intelligent Design" has always reflected the importance it puts on efficiency. Even before the hybrid, I can say confidently that Porsche has the lowest CO2 emissions per kilometer when compared to counterpart models from other manufacturers. We have a tradition of leading the charge against CO2 emissions. In early 2010 we introduced the Cayenne hybrid, which is cutting edge in many ways. In addition we have a hybrid Panamera. And running on tracks around the world we have the sports car GT3R hybrid. This is not intended to be produced or sold, but is rather a “racing lab" through which Porsche can test and pioneer new cutting-edge hybrid technology.</p><h4>So the supply for hybrids is there. Is the demand?</h4><p>The demand for hybrid cars, generally, depends on the tax incentives that are made available to customers. It is currently more expensive to produce a hybrid car than a normal one, which makes it more expensive than internal combustion engines on the market for all manufacturers. Therefore the state, in whatever country, needs to promote the use of hybrids by giving tax incentives, reducing road taxes, giving rewards for scrapping old cars in favor of hybrids, and putting forward legislation creating ceilings for CO2 emissions. In Lebanon, unfortunately, there are no such laws, and therefore a hybrid is positioned at about 10% more expensive than a similar petrol car. As a result, the consumer is faced with a higher price without incentives, plus the concern that this is new technology that may change in the near future. The fuel advantage is marginal, providing a 10% or 15% reduction. The strongest reason to buy one of these cars is to reduce your environmental impact. In order for this to be reason enough for consumers, you need a culture that is pushing you in that direction. We are hopeful that this can become the case in Lebanon.</p><h4>In 2005 you saw the potential of the Lebanese market, and you invested personally. What is your outlook and where do you see potential?</h4><p>The future is bright. From the Porsche side, the company is increasing its production and occupying new market space by introducing new models. Porsche is taking advantage of its knowledge, R&amp;D, and heritage to fill in the gaps that it doesn't supply yet. In Lebanon, we see big opportunities. First there is the potential to reduce taxes. Second, there is pending legislation that would affect the driving culture, such as the renewal of the existing car fleet and the continuous upgrading of the road network. We now see the road network getting better and better, and people enjoy driving more. I feel that the day will come when the government revamps automotive legislation in Lebanon. As a member of the Lebanese Association of Automobile Importers, we have sent many proposals to the authorities based on laws that have been successfully implemented in other parts of the world. These include a reduction of customs duties, which would promote the car industry as well as make the roads safer, and emissions-reduction measures such as taxes on higher polluting older cars. I am optimistic about this type of reform in Lebanon, and I see continued potential in the country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>With the newly elected cabinet, how are you looking to improve coordination with the Municipality?<br></h4><p>The Municipality of Beirut is like an open government—our work is not politics, it is development. We were elected to serve everyone, so whoever becomes Prime Minister, or Interior Minister, we have to deal with them. I met with Prime Minister Mikati and we agreed on how to work on our agenda, and I met with the Interior Minister because I report to him, as he is also the Minister for all municipalities as well. All municipalities have to report to him directly. For example, whenever I have a big project I have to obtain approval from the Minister, and some of the projects have to go all the way to the Council of Ministers. We have agreed on how to push forward Beirut's various projects, and I will be provided with all the necessary support to get these projects moving and fulfill their potential.</p><h4>What are your strategies for improving efficiency and completing projects?</h4><p>The problem with people in the public sector is that they will not meet to solve problems. When I came into office, I told players in the various sectors that whenever they had a problem, before they send me an answer we should meet. Getting all parties concerned with a project together around a table helped to solve many issues. Furthermore, the US is sponsoring our project to boost efficiency through the New York University of Albany, which helps municipalities in Lebanon, including that of Beirut, which aim to review our by-laws and make them more efficient, and to review the overall system that works between the departments in a municipality.</p><h4>What main projects you are working on, and what projects would you like to work on?</h4><p>The most important issue is solving the traffic and parking problem in Beirut. In order to do this we are working in a few different directions. The first order of the day is to solve intersection problems, and make the traffic flow smoother by creating underpasses. The second is to install proper traffic lights and to establish a control center. At the moment we have the equipment, but we do not have the know-how, hence people need to be trained to operate such equipment. The third method is to open roads in Beirut that have been closed until now. As there is no mandate to not construct roads, those roads that had been planned in the past are now being opened up. We hope this project will make traffic smoother throughout the city.</p><div class="quote">“The most important issue is solving the traffic and parking problem in Beirut. In order to do this we are working in a few different directions."</div><h4>What is your vision for the future of the city?</h4><p>My vision for the future of Beirut is that I want the people to love their city. I love this city. The only time I left was for graduate school. I believe in working for Beirut, and serving the community to make a difference. I believe we can make many positive changes to this city, as it already has something special about it. We're going to continue working on cleanliness, beauty, and the environment. The city is hugely diverse, and is a beacon of peaceful coexistence for the region.</p><h4>How open is the economy in Beirut?</h4><p>It is open to everyone. That is what is beautiful about Beirut. We want to maintain that and build on it for the future. Let's have more projects inside Beirut and let's solve these problems, because if Beirut succeeds, Lebanon succeeds. That is why whoever controls the government is welcome to work with us, coordinate with us, and they will find us more than willing to work with them for the future and for the progress of Beirut.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Excluding GCC countries, Lebanon is the MENA region's highest per capita importer of US goods and services. What current trends can you identify in US-Lebanese trade activities?<br></h4><p>US exports to Lebanon constitute around 10% of Lebanon's total imports, and that number is on the rise. Given that Lebanon is such a tiny country, it is a huge market for US products and services. Despite the political situation and sensitive relationship Lebanon has had for a long time with the US, the demand for American goods seems to be constantly increasing. For the last three years the US was Lebanon's number one trading partner, with some of the main exports to Lebanon being mineral fuel and oil, machinery and equipment, vehicles, pharmaceutical products, cereals and tobacco, textiles, as well as others.</p><h4>What is your outlook for US-Lebanese trade levels for 2011 and for the medium term?</h4><p>Lebanon's reform efforts are a priority for the country, especially in the field of telecommunications, education, and electricity, as well as other infrastructure developments. Any positive outcome will make room for further collaboration with the US and increase investment opportunities and eventually our commercial ties. Given the recent legislation Congress has passed reauthorizing the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP)—the program designed to promote economic growth in the developing world by providing preferential duty-free entry for up to 4,800 products—we suspect that exports to the US should increase.</p><h4>What steps do you feel should be taken to further boost commercial relations between Lebanon and the US?</h4><p>Lebanon is currently still negotiating its accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO), which will facilitate trade and investment between Lebanon and other countries, and mainly the US. We still have a lot of improvements and reforms to make before we are eligible to join, but once we do, so many doors will be opened and trade will flourish. These improvements and reforms are familiar to us and not unattainable. We have been lobbying for them for a long time, and hopefully things seem to be picking up.</p><div class="quote">“Lebanon's reform efforts are a priority for the country, especially in the field of telecommunications, education, and electricity, as well as other infrastructure developments."</div><p>What are Lebanon's advantages as a destination for current or potential American investment?</p><p>There are several factors that make Lebanon a good business partner. It has highly educated human resources, a good quality of life, and a strategic location in the Middle East that qualifies it to be a regional hub and an ideal location for regional headquarters. Lebanon offers one of the most liberal investment climates in the Middle East and offers incentives to attract foreign and domestic investment, including low income tax rates for individuals and corporations. Lebanon has a free-market economy based on a laissez-faire philosophy, and it is mostly dollarized. The absence of controls on the movement of capital and limited restrictions on investors also make it a great candidate. Furthermore, Lebanon was not really affected by the global financial crisis because of its banking regulations and restrictions, and it still boasts high levels of liquidity and remittances.</p><h4>What is the chamber doing to promote dialogue with public institutions?</h4><p>The many projects and activities the chamber organizes in collaboration with other associations in Lebanon help foster relationships within Lebanon's public institutions. AmCham Lebanon supports several initiatives by other associations and helps promote their activities if they fall under the general AmCham mission. We have had countless partnerships with public institutions and created dialogue and a synergy between the many entities in Lebanon.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the story behind Fransabank and its growth in Lebanon and overseas?</h4><p>Established since 1921 and listed first amongst banks in Lebanon, Fransabank today enjoys the ranking of a top-four leading Lebanese bank. The Group's banking and finance legacy dates back over more than nine decades of excellence supported by its very responsible role in the multi-dimensional development of the economies and communities it serves. The Group has succeeded in establishing, developing, and consolidating a competitive edge that earned it a leading position amongst the Lebanese banking community and the countries into which it expanded. Today, Fransabank Group has a consolidated presence in nine countries: Lebanon, France, Algeria, Syria, Sudan, Belarus, Libya, Cuba, and most recently in Cyprus and very soon in Iraq. The Group also ranks first in terms of local branch network with 107 branches strategically spread all over the country, providing the Lebanese community with all types of banking products and services to satisfy their personal and professional banking wants and needs. Fransabank Group succeeded in positioning itself as a forward-looking, trustworthy, dynamic, innovative, creative, and socially responsible leading financial group that has been providing top-notch financial services to its clients in particular, and to the banking industry at large, while always putting the client at the heart of all its activities. Fransabank Group offers its large clientele universal banking services and activities mainly through its main commercial bank, Fransabank SAL, and its local and foreign subsidiaries and associates.</p><h4>How were the bank's financials for 2010?</h4><p>The year 2010 carries a very special significance for Fransabank Group. It was the eve of its 90th anniversary and marks at the same time another record performance year for the Group. In this context, it evidenced a strong profit growth track, with an increase of 39.84% in net profits, translated into $145.74 million in 2010, out of which $92.58 million are attributed to the mother company Fransabank SAL. This growth is mainly due to the Group's effective strategy at home and in selective regional and international markets, complemented by the Group's efficient management of its expenses exposure. Total assets reached $12.24 billion, growing by 13.24% relative to the end of 2009; customer deposits reached $10.08 billion, growing by 11.86% as compared to the same period of 2009, and the loans portfolio reached $3.14 billion, growing by 36% as compared to the same period of 2009. The cost-to-income ratio stood at 48.30% in 2010 as compared to 54.70% in 2009. Return on average equity (ROAE) and return on average assets (ROAA) stood at 13.27% and 1.26%, respectively. The capital adequacy ratio (CAR) stood at 12% as of end-2010, which is above the minimum CAR required by the Banque du Liban.</p><h4>In what areas is Fransabank focusing on for its core revenue streams?</h4><p>Fransabank offers its clients a large basket of carefully developed and marketed products that ensure its clients a universal banking experience, whereby they can find at our one-stop shops all the banking and financial products and services needed. Our range of products and services includes retail, corporate, SME, investment, and private banking in addition to a broad range of other financial services. During 2010 and the first quarter of 2011, a set of products and services were offered to our client base. Special attention has been given to SMEs as we created several SME products like the pioneering “agriculture loan" and the first of its kind “energy business loan" and the “commercial vehicle loan." Several new housing loan programs were also introduced to the market. Fransabank was the first to launch tailor-made housing loans for the displaced, for members of the Internal Security Forces, and for judges. This leads us to the bank's continuous desire to maintain a sustainable and balanced partnership between the private and public sectors, which is clearly evidenced through such products and other customized offerings presented in 2010 and in 1Q2011.</p><div class="quote">“The Group's banking and finance legacy dates back over more than nine decades of excellence."</div><h4>How do you see the business environment currently in Lebanon, and how is that knowledge changing your overall market strategy?</h4><p>The Lebanese economy grew by approximately 7.1% in 2010, and this is in addition to the previous three years where Lebanon has grown an average of 24% over that period. The Lebanese banking sector has achieved a growth rate of about 12% in 2010. This reflects the rather sustainable level of customers and investor business activity during 2010. The current political internal instability coupled with the unprecedented events that our region is experiencing has created a slowdown in the Lebanese economy. Despite this, economic activity in April and May 2011 has witnessed some relative improvements, and we are all hoping for further improvement.</p><h4>What has been the level of growth in foreign-based assets?</h4><p>At Fransabank, outside of Lebanon, we have a consolidated presence in eight international markets: namely France (since 1984), Algeria (since 2006), Syria (since 2007), Sudan (since 2005), Belarus (since 2008), Libya (since 2008), Cuba, and most recently in Cyprus (since 2010). We are in the process of consolidating our presence in those countries and the results that have been achieved in 2010 are very promising and indicate a greater contribution by our international presence to our bottom line.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-higher-grade]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the state of the real estate sector in Lebanon?</h4><p>It's maturing and developing. We're reaching a high sophistication level in terms of clients. They like and appreciate our products, because we bring them only the best projects. We prefer quality projects rather than bigger, riskier ones. The Lebanese are very informed buyers.</p><h4>There's been a 25% increase in prices from 2006 to 2008. Do you see growth slowing down in the sector?</h4><p>That 25% figure is deceptive, because that's only limited to very unique properties. After 2008, the growth slowed by 15%, and that should decrease further. I think there will be a stabilization of prices. Real estate is a science; there is a growth cycle. I think the cycle is reaching its peak. In Lebanon the challenging part is that it's not a controlled or regular cycle. Here it's like a wave with different fluctuations. There are so many variables to factor in, like the political situation, the effect of the diaspora, regional dynamics, the global economy, and so on. The diaspora is a big factor. There are millions of Lebanese with serious funds throughout the world, and a lot of them invest in Lebanon. In fact, they were investing even during the rise in prices in the real estate market. How much they influence things is not known, however, and we have no reliable figures on that.</p><h4>What projects do you specialize in?</h4><p>We specialize in high-end projects. We focus on unique, grade-A locations, distinguished, and luxury architecture, at relatively affordable prices. We don't try to follow market trends—we stay focused on luxury.</p><div class="quote">“There are millions of Lebanese with serious funds throughout the world, and a lot of them invest in Lebanon."</div><h4>How does the company define grade-A projects?</h4><p>They are defined by location, accessibility, visibility, and the surroundings. It should be a developed neighborhood. That's where we try to locate our projects after vigorous market analysis. I do a lot of research and analysis to determine a grade-A location. It's not always just about having a sea view and the common elements. These types of places range between $4,500 and $10,000 in price per sqm. For offices, there isn't much grade-A but mostly grade-B capacity, which has good parking and amenities, ranging from anywhere between $3,000 and $5,000 per sqm. Grade-A office spaces go from $5,000 to $8,000 per sqm, but these developments are very rare. That being said, people's perception and expectation of luxury real estate has also been changing. Whereas before people would've looked for a 600 sqm place, that expectation fell down to 500 sqm, then 400, and now to 300 sqm. In that regard, people's expectations are decreasing rapidly. Soon it will be down to a two-bedroom place with an open kitchen, and so on. This shows maturity. We are a small city and it's very cramped, resources are scarce, and it's expensive. We were among the first to offer 180- to 260-sqm flats. Clients want three bedrooms, a closed kitchen, and a helper's room.</p><h4>How has the availability of housing loans had an effect on the real estate market?</h4><p>It's been very encouraging and a great new option for everyone, and it is expanding the clientele base. This system has only been this widespread since 2009. It's very controlled and regulated. Not everyone can get a loan. It involves a significant down payment, and you have to prove stability of income. The Banque du Liban is doing a great job to make sure everybody can afford a home loan. That has been very encouraging. Approximately 50% of loans have gone to locals, 40% to diaspora members, and 10% to Gulf clients.</p><h4>How much do you rely on pre-sales?</h4><p>It's a very common trend, and I don't think there are any companies that don't depend to some extent on pre-sales. However, we try to limit it to 50% of our business.</p><h4>Can you tell us about some of your projects?</h4><p>We are developing a grade-A office project right in the heart of downtown Beirut called Stratum. It's accessible and close to all the big corporate clients, hotels, restaurants, and big office spaces, and has good amenities and parking. It's almost complete. We have another grade-A residential project, the One Oak Residence, located right on the waterfront downtown, with a full sea and mountain view. It's a very exclusive complex, not your standard tower structure. Everyone feels they have unique apartments; everyone has separate entrances, and so forth. We have another project in the Ashrafieh neighborhood. It's one building with three different entrances, ample parking spaces, and a sense of exclusivity. All our projects are also smart buildings. You can control your flat from your iPad or laptop, be it utilities or electrical appliances. We are introducing these new amenities with our sister company, an IT firm.</p><h4>What about future projects?</h4><p>We have two new projects, one in Beirut and another outside of Beirut, both of them are again very exclusive. Outside of real estate, we are also in the process of setting up a private equity firm that invests in other fields, like restaurants, and will focus on venture capital, like joint ventures, and so on. We will develop a private equity real estate fund. It has already acquired property in California and New York, and is also looking at opportunities in Europe.</p><h4>What is the size of your company?</h4><p>We have around 50 employees. We focus on different departments. We have our own in-house development management, investment management, and interior architecture units.</p><h4>How do you see Lebanon's potential for foreign investment?</h4><p>Lebanon has a lot of high-risk/high-reward opportunities. Therefore, it depends on the appetite of the investor. However, there are safe investments to be found mainly in the banking and real estate sectors. Those still yield higher profits than in Europe. Everyone wants to be in Lebanon, and it's a great place for investors. There's also very strong human capital present, which is very adaptable and entrepreneurial. You need to get involved, you need to do your research, and you can find out who you should work with. Lebanon is very transparent. In two months you can get all the information you need just from talking with people, it's not that big a place.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize the Lebanese education system?<br></h4><p>In the Middle East Lebanon is considered to be the minaret and the lighthouse of education, even though there are universities everywhere. This is probably due to the long history of university education in Lebanon and to the atmosphere of freedom and tolerance that permeates in the country. Many believe that if one wants to receive a world-class education, one should study in Lebanon as it is a bridge between the West and the East and its academic programs are of the highest caliber.</p><h4>How is the cost of education impacting the sector?</h4><p>In Lebanon there are around 40 universities. Some of them identify themselves as the original establishments. They used to dominate the private sector, and only those who could pay big could attend. Students who were not able to pay such fees had to go to vocational schools, which were generally quite cheap. Most people in Lebanon could not afford to send their children to expensive private universities, and students did not want to go to vocational schools. To fill the gap in demand, new universities emerged wanting to help by providing low-tuition education. The purpose was to deliver a good university education at a reasonable cost. Some of these universities are low cost from every point of view: low fees, low quality of education, and the quality of their graduates is inferior to market demands and to acceptable standards. The strategy of the American University for Science and Technology (AUST) is to provide excellent American-style education at a reasonable cost. Our university has an educational mission, not a business money-making mission.</p><h4>How has the concept of AUST given it an advantage as well as students an opportunity to further their education?</h4><p>Our mission is to prepare students to become good citizens. We want to provide them with opportunities for work while studying at the same time, to make education possible to those who otherwise cannot cover their expenses. Internally, we are bent on improving ourselves to the position from which we can compete with the older universities that used to have a monopoly on the market. AUST started with 300 students and now it has around 5,000. In a small and democratic country such as Lebanon, students know what they want and set out to get it. In only a few years, AUST has climbed in reputation and the profile of the average student changed to include those who seek good education without concern for low or high fees. In order to meet the influx of students we decided to have morning and afternoon classes. In a way, we operate two colleges in the same facilities and all this is done in order to provide all seekers with the opportunity to benefit from the type of education that we offer. It is important to note that AUST has a special office to help students locate jobs while they study. We believe that this gives them seniority in the future and the proper attitude in future jobs.</p><div class="quote">“In Lebanon there are around 40 universities. Some of them identify themselves as the original establishments."</div><h4>Are you working with the private sector to identify where there are available positions?</h4><p>We organize a job fair every year. In 2011 we had around 130 companies that came to offer jobs to our students. When a student is able to join a firm while still studying, that person gains seniority in the job, and by the time of graduation it doesn't cross his or her mind to work in the Gulf or elsewhere abroad. Rewarding jobs can be found here. At the beginning, when people went to the Gulf to find work, it was like the quest for gold in America. Now the Gulf's labor market is saturated, and the salaries are not that different from local ones.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>In October of 2011 I visited Beirut to meet with President Michel Sleiman, Speaker Nabih Berri, and Prime Minister Najib Mikati, to hear their views and assessment of the current situation in Lebanon and the region. Our meetings were very constructive, and I was encouraged to hear about the reforms that the government has launched so far. I was pleased to note that the Ministerial statement issued on the occasion included an explicit reference to deepening Lebanon's relations with the EU. For its part, the EU has welcomed the formation of the government in July 2011 and expressed expectation that Lebanon will fulfill its international obligations and continue on its path to reform.<br></p><p>These international obligations include the full implementation of UN Security Council resolutions and international agreements, including on human rights, the process of international justice, and effective cooperation with the Special Tribunal for Lebanon. Lebanon must provide a safe environment for UNIFIL to carry out its mandate and ensure the protection of its citizens as well as foreigners and refugees on its soil.</p><p>We are witnessing historical changes in the region. People stood up for their rights and legitimate aspirations. Today, democracy is being built where there was tyranny yesterday. And where there were fundaments of democracy, people are willing to deepen it in order to regain dignity and their basic legitimate rights like freedom to express themselves. This is a truly impressive process that goes for the benefit of all, and Lebanon with its population should be part of it.</p><div class="quote">“The EU's revised approach to the European Neighborhood Policy has underlined our commitment to work closer with countries that are ready to strengthen democracy and advance reforms."</div><p>The EU is supporting this process and these aspirations so that every single person in Lebanon (but also anywhere else) can benefit from it. We are very well aware of the many challenges Lebanon is facing: unity and stability of the country, national dialogue, and complex relations with its neighbors.</p><p>That's why we have revised the European Neighborhood policy, so that we could help in more effective ways to deal with all those challenges. We are offering this help to the government, to the political parties, and to civil society too, because in our new approach, civil society is as important a partner for us as the political interlocutors. The events in the region have reminded us of the need to work jointly on reinforcing deep democracy in Lebanon. I discussed the EU's willingness to support electoral reform and other measures to consolidate the accountability and independence of all national democratic institutions.</p><p>The EU's revised approach to the European Neighborhood Policy has underlined our commitment to work closer with countries that are ready to strengthen democracy and advance reforms.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Lebanese banks are known for their resiliency to both domestic as well as regional and international shocks. What factors contribute to this resiliency?</h4><p>The banking sector in Lebanon is made up of very well-established institutions that have been around for some time. The banks went through the economic boom of the 1950s and the 1960s, continued through the civil war between the 1970s and 1990s, and then the surge again in the 2000s. These are very traditional, family-owned banks. By family-owned, I mean banks, some of them publicly listed, that have a major entity or individual(s) that possess a large stake and who are still very much involved in the banks' operations and management. The positive side of having this concept of family-owned banks is that there is strong personal interest in the continuity and profitability of the banks coupled with the latest corporate governance standards including transparency reporting. In many cases worldwide, we've basically seen the fall of major financial institutions because, frankly, there was no major player among the shareholders monitoring or being actively involved in day-to-day operations that really ensured the continuity of the institution. We saw instances where the boards of directors' responsibilities were not carried out fully and the set triggers were not enough to avoid the banking meltdown. That's not the case here. Many of the major banks, and all of the smaller ones, have significant family money as part of their ownership structure. Having said that, you still need to have transparency for depositors, and this is what the regulators and the external auditors provide. We have very thorough banking laws. These regulations allow us to do business in Lebanon and to be competitive externally as well, while imposing on us high standards of risk guidelines and transparency. This is extremely important. This solid base was not just recently established; it's something that has been building up over the years.</p><h4>Does the fact that Lebanese banks are deposit driven also contribute to risk management and stability?</h4><p>This is what is maybe helping the banks in general. The liquidity is there because first there was an economic boom in the Middle East, followed by a period of stability. That environment produced significant remittances and FDI into Lebanon. However, that's not the only reason. Liquidity is very important, but it has to be within the framework of strict regulations. We have very stringent rules for minimum liquidity, not only in terms of level of liquidity and reserve requirements, but also in terms of what is considered to be liquid. At face value that appears to be a basic concept, but barring regulation, a bank could claim it is investing in a certain type of liquid securities, which may not always be the case. Again, liquidity has to be defined within a strict regulatory structure. And yes, the banks are liquid. In general, the banks have left tremendous liquidity on their balance sheets because they understand what the region in general, and Lebanon specifically, goes through in terms of political tension and turmoil. This liquidity goes hand-in-hand with our daily operations. At the same time, we are very traditional in terms of lending; we are typical conservative lenders. We look at the major risks and take all the necessary measures to mitigate them not just by ensuring a first way out, but also with additional tangible securities as collateral.</p><h4>Considering this historic resilience despite political tensions, do you think that the deposit growth seen in the sector in 2011 is a flight-to-quality coming from so-called Arab spring countries?</h4><p>We hope that's the case and we think that it most probably is the case. Yes, there has been an increase in the deposit base, which initially began in 2009-2010, and is still going on in 2011. But there have always been inflows from neighboring countries. This is not a new phenomenon. However, sometimes these deposits increase tremendously and in other periods they drop. These days we are seeing a bit more of an increase in deposits from abroad.</p><div class="quote">“Liquidity is very important, but it has to be within the framework of strict regulations."</div><h4>Since 2006 BankMed has doubled its equity. Can you tell us about the long-term strategy that has made growth possible?</h4><p>Back in 2005 our net profits were low. We managed to increase them tremendously and grew the balance sheet as well through various initiatives. First, back in the 2005-2006 period the bank underwent a major reorganization. Since then we have had a shift in strategy. Internally, in terms of reorganization and the re-engineering of all the procedures and policies, we rebuilt the organizational structure and reviewed how we conducted our daily operations. In terms of major business lines, we started entering into specific business lines geared more toward consumers and retail. Previously, we were very much into corporate banking, with a focus on blue-chip type institutions. We also changed that by moving more into SMEs. At the same time we brought some new blood into the bank, including very well-qualified and well-experienced individuals. That was an essential move that proved very effective because you had existing people in the bank who knew the clients, knew the business very well, and you had people from the outside coming in with new ideas. Looking back, even though what we did was quite basic, the combined efforts produced a major turnaround for the bank within a five-year span. The results definitely speak for themselves. BankMed has accessed the capital markets for the first time in 2009 by raising $100 million in preferred shares, and the bank now generates in excess of $100 million in net profits.</p><h4>What's your medium-term outlook for the Lebanese economy?</h4><p>Outlooks are tough to discuss, especially with the turmoil in our region. The fact is that the economy will be affected by two major aspects, at least in Lebanon: the political side, meaning instability, and the business environment and investments. Barring additional political issues, business appears to be slowing slightly compared to the previous two years. And actually, that is a good thing in my opinion. It isn't always ideal to have consistent very high growth years, and I think we are going through a stable period right now, with moderate growth. The peculiarity of this country is that businesses and operations are not constrained within Lebanon. Your typical large corporation in Lebanon has its network of operations all over the region. If there is a slowdown in the economy here, you still have these businesses operating in the GCC, for example, or in other areas of the Middle East and Africa. Therefore, I am not concerned about the future of the Lebanese economy. The public sector side might affect the growth of our economy. We have the ambition to see certain types of reforms implemented, especially in terms of increased partnership between the public and private sectors and the reduction of the country's budget deficit. This will help the economy in the long run. Again, this is not a concern, but this is where I would like to see a bit more effort being made.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[full-distribution]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have needs changed in Lebanon for petroleum products and where is the demand now?<br></h4><p>In terms of the public sector there is still a demand for fuel, and for gas oil for power factories. But in terms of the private sector for diesel, the main shift was in the early- to mid-2000s, when some of the sector moved more from gas oil to diesel with the introduction of EN 590 European specification diesel. Diesel is still not very popular, and its use in passenger cars is forbidden. Gasoline is still the main player in terms of automotive usage.</p><h4>How does the price ceiling affect the profitability of distributor companies?</h4><p>The profitability of the market is an ongoing debate. In the eyes of the public market, the companies are very profitable. It is a stereotype that has been in the market for a very long time, but it is actually false. We prepared a study in the past with PwC, and it went into the accounts of the companies, checked the costs and expenses, and realized the margins are currently inadequate. It has actually made a suggestion to the government to increase the margins, but there is no movement on this right now. The margins of the service stations were LBP900-1,000 per 20 liters and as per under the proposal of the study, it would increase to LBP1,600 per 20 liters. Therefore, it has increased the margins of service stations, but the margins of the distribution companies have not increased.</p><h4>What is the government's stance on oil subsidies and how effective do you think this option is?</h4><p>It is reported that the government has reached an agreement with taxi drivers to subsidize some of their consumption. In my opinion, this is a wrong approach. The tax on oil products in Lebanon is not high, and the overall price of gasoline and diesel in Lebanon is not high relative to countries in the region. Maybe Lebanon is among the cheapest in terms of absolute value, but when you compare it to the standard of living, or minimum income, it becomes very high. The answer is not to decrease the price or take out the tax, but to raise the minimum wage to try and boost the economy—increasing purchasing power and the standard of living and creating employment is a more effective way.</p><div class="quote">“The tax on oil products in Lebanon is not high, and the overall price of gasoline and diesel in Lebanon is not high relative to countries in the region."</div><h4>What is your capacity and service station strategy?</h4><p>We hope to expand on two different levels. Firstly, we'd like to increase our network in the country. Secondly, we'd like to increase the volume per station because we believe that Lebanon is oversaturated with stations. The number of stations per capita is one of the highest in the world. The last study showed 2,200 service stations in Lebanon, whereas in Dubai, which is twice the size in regards to population, has around 350. The cost is much higher for us because you need more pumps, signage, stations, and land. The same service could be provided by far fewer stations.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Positive Signs]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[positive-signs]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does having a background in media assist in the company's property business?</h4><p>As you may know, the media is the main marketing tool to promote any product or project, so owning the right media tools, the right strategy, and know-how will definitely enable anyone to sell—even desert property. Plus Properties has become a strong name in that field, renowned for its successful sales strategy. That is why a lot of developers have approached us to carry out marketing and sales for their projects.</p><h4>What potential do you see in the Lebanese construction sector?</h4><p>It is the right time for construction in Lebanon. As for property, the potential is in new demand for small apartments in various regions. Much of this demand is from Lebanese expatriates, buying property to be used as a “pied-í -terre"—and there are upward of 12 million Lebanese in the diaspora. Demand is also high in the suburbs, but from a different group. This is the new generation who want to buy their dream homes but cannot afford the prices in the center. On the other hand, the country is only a short flight away from the Gulf region—Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, and the UAE—making Lebanon a good target for investors or people who want to buy a home, second home, or holiday home.</p><h4>Having had experience in Dubai also, what major differences exist between the two markets?</h4><p>I would buy land worth $500 million in Dubai, even though I only had $25 million in my pocket. I bought the land knowing I would be able to make quick sales in a matter of months. This is not the case in Lebanon. In some instances, people buy an extra apartment for their children as an investment. However, usually, they have the money. The banking system in Lebanon is solid. It isn't possible to buy land or begin a project unless you have all the capital you need. There are no assurances given on land. This does, however, mean that leveraging isn't great—the system is a bit conservative.</p><div class="quote">“We will continue to incorporate green technology on a supply and demand basis and continue making projects we can be proud of."</div><h4>What is your assessment of the real estate sector?</h4><p>Looking at the 1975-2011 period, it is interesting to note that prices have always been on the up. Sometimes pauses occur, but prices have never dropped. This is due to the limited number of plots available. In Solidere's master plan, there are only a few plots remaining, whereas the rest were quickly sold. In Ashrafieh and Verdun there is no more land—we are limited by geography. Thus, demand is always higher than supply. Generally, when there is a downturn, people refrain from buying. When an upturn is anticipated, they begin buying again.</p><h4>How significantly does foreign investment and the Lebanese diaspora affect your business?</h4><p>Out of the 300 apartments we have sold over the last three years, the majority of buyers have been expatriates. Up to 60% were of Lebanese descent, 15% residents, and some foreigners from the Gulf and Africa. We attempt to reach this market by attending world exhibitions outside of Lebanon. Wherever there is a market, we try to make an impression. In this endeavor, we have recently been to Nigeria, Canada, and the UK. We also seek to participate in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and other GCC countries. We also pursue clients through the media and even social networking tools. We believe in the impact of media exposure.</p><h4>What are your expectations for Plus Towers?</h4><p>It is a very nice project. It was designed in Miami by the studio Arquitectonica. It is in the heart of Beirut—a very prime location. It contains a mall and a gym, and is an eco-friendly building. Currently, Lebanon is not very sustainable in its construction, as building green means you must pay more. This has to be justified in terms of sales. Today, people in Lebanon don't want to pay extra for that. However, sales are going well, and in pre-sales terms, up to date, we have sold 40% of the space already.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the sector and for Plus Holding?</h4><p>We will continue to see growth until 2015. We hope to establish our name across the Middle East. Our plan is then to expand by calling investors in by 2015. We are proud of what we have achieved in terms of recognition. Because of real estate demand and the population profile, we have decided to stay relatively small in size. We will continue to incorporate green technology on a supply and demand basis, and continue making projects we can be proud of.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[The Business of Ethics]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[the-business-of-ethics]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main advantages in having a regionally diverse background in the education field?</h4><p>This is something that I am so thankful for. I have a French education. After spending 19 years in Canada, I moved back to the US in 1990. This gave me the opportunity to broaden my horizons. People aren't satisfied with their own culture nowadays—they need to be exposed to different ways of life. For me, diversity is very enriching. The more you know about different people, different cultures, and different views, the richer you are in terms of your thinking and contributions to society. I tell people that if you speak two languages, then you are the equivalent of two people, three languages, three people, each thinking differently and bringing different points of view to bear upon the issues at hand. I consider myself lucky to have been exposed to so many cultures.</p><h4>How does this ideology influence Lebanese American University (LAU)?</h4><p>LAU's history tells the whole story. The vision of our founder started in Norwich, Connecticut, in 1834. Her dream was to travel to the shores of Beirut and establish an institution for the education of women in the Ottoman Empire. In the first year there were three female students. The institution grew not only because of the vision, but there was also the will and determination to do something good. Above all of this, there was the passion to do something for others so they may have a better life. The school became known as LAU in the 1990s with two major campuses, one in Beirut and the other in Byblos. LAU has now seven schools including a School of Medicine and a School of Pharmacy. Our School of Pharmacy is the only one outside the US that is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE).</p><h4>What makes LAU stand out from other places of higher learning in Lebanon?</h4><p>About 20% of our student body comes from 86 countries around the world. It's not a religious-based institution; it's for everyone. The mission that makes this institution unique is as follows. There is an incredible and unshakable commitment to excellence in everything we do. This institution is a role model not only for Lebanon but also for the world because we don't discriminate on the basis of religion, politics, or socioeconomic status. For students, faculty, and staff, if you qualify, and you are ready to work very hard to teach, work, and study here, we welcome you with open arms. For the students who don't have the means to come here, we find it not only our responsibility but also our obligation to help them find the means. We give over $12 million a year in financial aid, and we are going to increase that number to $14.5 million in the next couple of years because we want the institution to be socio-economically diverse. Another unique feature of our mission is that we educate the whole person. We pay attention not only to the academic side, but also to the maturity and personal growth of our students. We don't want graduates with no social skills who can't really establish links and relationships with other people. Interpersonal skills are very important nowadays. Additionally, all of these components do not mean anything unless they are guided by a very robust ethical compass. Ethics are being eroded even in the best of democracies, and I think it's the responsibility of institutions like LAU to restore ethics to where they belong in our lives.</p><div class="quote">“LAU's history tells the whole story. The vision of our founder started in Norwich, Connecticut, in 1834. Her dream was to travel to the shores of Beirut and establish an institution for the education of women in the Ottoman Empire."</div><h4>What have been some recent additions to the university?</h4><p>The Byblos campus was established in the 1990s and it has most of the professional schools. The Gilbert and Rose-Marie Chagoury School of Medicine was a major addition to the university; it was established in association with Harvard Medical International. Three driving forces determine the success of any institution in my opinion, especially in education. First is the ability to articulate and establish a clear vision of what it is you want to do. Second is the will and determination to implement that vision. The third is a burning passion to grow. These three elements were hard at work in establishing the School of Medicine. Our first aim is to produce graduates that provide the best medical care to their patients in accordance with international standards. Our second is to foster the ability to establish interpersonal, professional, and ethical relations with patients, patients' families, and colleagues. Third, we want to develop the ability to deal with sensitive issues such as death. Fourth, we aim to instill an unshakable commitment to ethics; the integrity of a doctor is essential. This includes issues of money. A doctor should make enough money to live comfortably and provide for his or her family, but they are healers, not businessmen. Lastly, we want to produce doctors who are role models in society in terms of health issues.</p><h4>How do you participate with the private sector to provide graduates in the areas it needs?</h4><p>It is important to be in close contact with the private sector because we need to have feedback about our students. In my opinion, a university cannot be an ivory tower separate from society. It must be a part of society, responding to all the challenges that society has to face. A university is a place where society does its thinking.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the Council for Development and Reconstruction (CDR) developed and transformed over the years to become what it is today?<br></h4><p>It all started just before the 1975 civil war. A Ministry of Planning already existed, but was not functioning efficiently. It was a public entity that had been entrusted with the role of planning for the various ministries, and had control over their budgets and a hand in the execution of plans. In a democratic country, no minister would accept another fellow minister to have an upper hand over his role and duties. Therefore, the aim behind establishing the Ministry of Planning failed. Consequently, the government took the decision in 1977 to create an executing agency for the Council of Ministers—the Council for Development and Reconstruction—and gave it unprecedented powers to avoid any administrative routine that could slow down the reconstruction and development process. Entrusted with the most important role in the process of reconstruction and economic recovery, the CDR prepares general plans for the country, it mobilizes external financing for priority projects within investment plans, it negotiates and signs foreign financing agreements on behalf of the Lebanese government—which is of a relief to most funding sources since they are able to negotiate with only one entity—and executes projects by appointment from the Council of Ministers.</p><h4>What have been some of the main projects that the CDR has implemented?</h4><p>In the past, we used to focus our concerns on the reconstruction, rehabilitation, and upgrading of existing infrastructure. At a later stage we were requested to execute additional tasks including an accentuated commitment to project implementation. We began working at full speed in order to fulfill the needs of citizens in the various regions and contribute to improving their standards of living. Eventually, we turned out to be the body responsible for the major projects of reconstruction and development in the country, accountable to the Council of Ministers and managing its sector-based actions with full coordination from the concerned ministries. Nowadays, we still face challenges executing vital projects in sectors of prime concern for the Lebanese people. Our main priority projects are those related to electricity, water and waste-water treatment, and transport. Some other priorities we are working on are related to the environment.</p><h4>How are you working to satisfy future demand in water for sectors like agriculture?</h4><p>Currently, we are approaching some socioeconomic concerns including the supply of water to the agriculture sector. With sources of funding coming from the EU Commission, we have completed a few irrigation projects and man-made lakes, and soon we will be launching the long awaited Litani Canal 800 conveyor in South Lebanon. This project will increase the supply of drinking water and provide continuous irrigation for 15,000 hectares of crops in the south.</p><div class="quote">“Entrusted with the most important role in the process of reconstruction and economic recovery, the CDR prepares general plans for the country."</div><h4>Which sectors in Lebanon are most in need of development and upgrading?</h4><p>The electricity sector is one of the major problems in Lebanon. The previous Minister of Energy and Water has been reassigned the same post in the new government, hence avoiding changes in strategy, and we are both putting in a lot of effort to achieve the development program, which has the approval of the Council of Ministers. The CDR has secured some funds for the rehabilitation of existing power plants and transformer stations.</p><h4>Does a majority of the funding come from abroad or through domestic funding?</h4><p>The Ministry of Energy and Water's priority projects have been divided into three segments. The most urgent ones are to be financed locally by the government. Over the medium to long term, external sources will also provide funding, and independent power producers (IPPs) will also provide funding. It is worth mentioning that borrowing from external sources can take almost two years to materialize, especially if we need time to finish negotiations for a memorandum of understanding, to achieve preliminary studies, impact assessments, and to obtain the endorsement of the Council of Ministers and the ratification of the Lebanese parliament.</p><h4>Will the Lebanese economy continue to be a service economy or will it try to increase production?</h4><p>If we compare it to the economies of the other countries in the region, our economy's strength is built on services. Services have always been what we do best. Even the Lebanese people working abroad are mainly engaged in the service sectors. In the industrial sector, I don't really see how Lebanon can highly compete with some other countries, but we still have hopes to improve some of the existing industries in Lebanon. We welcome investors and, at the same time, we keep an eye on the inflation rate, trying to keep it under control so as to avoid becoming a speculative market. Money comes to the country in three forms: direct cash deposit, real estate investments, and the manufacturing sector. In our case, the manufacturing sector needs additional support.</p><h4>Human resources are one of the Lebanese economy's main assets. How is the CDR looking to maintain or improve the quality of the Lebanese workforce?</h4><p>Since 1992, we have rehabilitated and constructed about 1,400 schools. We also achieved the construction of a new campus for Lebanese University with a capacity of 25,000 students. In addition, we are currently building another campus in the northern city of Tripoli. Our work in the education sector is based on building and providing equipment, thus increasing the capacity for larger numbers of students. Whether through securing funds or grants, we are joining efforts with the Ministry of Education in order to achieve its programs.</p><h4>What business development would you like to see in Lebanon?</h4><p>The Economic &amp; Social Fund for Development (ESFD) has been created in Lebanon. We have already received grants worth ‚¬36 million for this fund to help people in establishing their small- or medium-sized enterprises. Community projects have been achieved that are dedicated to job creation. Citizens are being taught how to keep their financial books and follow their bank accounts efficiently. On the other hand, lending banks are satisfied due to the increased amount of customers. Citizens who were never able to start their own business before are now able to because we guarantee the loans they are getting.</p><h4>What is the future direction of the CDR and the government in terms of development?</h4><p>The Lebanese economy is noted for its resilience, having withstood wars and invasions as well as internal clashes. People have taken notice of this. We survived the global economic crisis and even excelled in a few sectors while other countries suffered. The Lebanese people always live in a pre-conflict mentality. The post-conflict does not affect them. They don't show concern anymore in post-conflict situations. Our government is a very conservative one and it paid off when the big crisis occurred. We have risen from much worse situations before. For the CDR, besides the funding and the planning job, it all depends on the government as to whether operations must increase or decrease. I hope the government will implement additional administrative reform in the ministries and will hire more qualified people because we have a lot of vacancies. We need to extend the scope of our activities beyond our current operations.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has your diverse experience in both the public and private sectors shaped your current vision for Lebanon?<br></h4><p>If you look back to almost a year ago, the situation in Lebanon was somehow critical; the political tension among March 14 and March 8 supporters was getting to a point that could have jeopardized stability in the country. I was convinced that Lebanon needed a different way, a centrist way, which is the only way Lebanon can regain its stability in order to put it back on course to prosperity. The business world develops in you the entrepreneurial spirit, which trains you to dare and venture into untested territories. The political arena is more of a consensual playing field where you need to convince first before achieving your goals. Combining the entrepreneurial spirit with the “need-to-convince" attitude is quite challenging for me. Running the country requires a driving force, a catalyst, which is what the private sector trains you for. However, it also needs patience and convincing techniques.</p><h4>You have declared that your aim is national unity. What efforts is your administration taking to build consensus within Lebanon's partisan political landscape?</h4><p>I've always said that Lebanon is not a two-lane road where only the issues of the Special Tribunal for Lebanon (STL) and Hezbollah's arms are running. These are issues on which we don't have consensus for the time being. Lebanon is a 10- to 15-lane highway where we can keep on the left side both the STL and arms issues rolling; however, on the other lanes there are the issues where there could be consensus, such as electricity, health care, education, social security, and the like, and this is what I plan to tackle first.</p><h4>What key targets are you seeking to meet so as to improve Lebanon's electricity generation capacity?</h4><p>In Lebanon we currently have an average supply of 1,500 MW with an average demand of 2,100 MW, while peak demand in summer reaches 2,500 MW. It shouldn't be considered an achievement if we install additional capacity to fill the gap. This should have been done many years ago. My objective is to involve the private sector in order to be able to supply Lebanon's citizens with power 24/7 within three years.</p><div class="quote">“I was convinced that Lebanon needed a different way, a centrist way."</div><h4>This year will see the rollout of a 3.5G network in Lebanon. In your view, what will be the economic impact of this move?</h4><p>The telecoms sector has implications on many other sectors in the economy. Upgrading our telecoms networks to fit the needs of society is not a luxury, but rather a necessity. Again, this is a sector in which we were pioneers in the 1990s, and became one of the laggards in the 21st century. I'll do my utmost to bring Lebanon back up to the highest standards as this sector helps other sectors improve their contributions to GDP.</p><h4>What are your administrative and legislative goals for improving the ease of doing business in Lebanon?</h4><p>The Ministry of Economy along with the economic team at the Prime Minister's Office are closely working on this issue, which has been labeled as a priority. All the red tape, costs, and time wasted in order to run a company in Lebanon has deterred many young entrepreneurs from establishing their start-ups and forced some multinationals to reconsider establishing their regional base in Lebanon. The good thing is that there is an awareness among all ministers and politicians about the need to improve on this matter.</p><h4>What sectors and industries do you feel are the most promising for foreign investment?</h4><p>Lebanon has always enjoyed a free economy, and investors are free to invest in all sectors. However, some industries seem to attract more than others, particularly those sectors with high value-added. The reason for this being the cost of production as well as relatively high (skilled) labor costs, which force us to compete with European products rather than Chinese products. This is witnessed in the fashion, jewelry, software, and banking sectors, which require skilled and specialized labor.</p><h4>What steps do you feel should be taken to improve Lebanon's debt-to-GDP ratio?</h4><p>We need to grow our economy. The civil war as well as the “from time to time" political instability has deterred Lebanon from growing its economy to where it should be. A study was done showing that had we not had the war in Lebanon, our economy would have been three times what it is today, which would have reduced our debt-to-GDP ratio down to almost 55%. We need to focus on growing the economy by encouraging investors to create jobs, which would reduce immigration and keep more Lebanese at home. This, by default, would help grow the economy. One other issue we need to focus on is running our budget in a more efficient way by containing costs more efficiently and allocating a larger part of our budget to capital expenditure, which would also benefit economic growth.</p><h4>What role does the country's finance sector play in ensuring resiliency in the real economy? What is Lebanon's potential as a global financial center?</h4><p>The banking sector has enjoyed many years of continuous growth. Lebanese bankers are known to be well seasoned and professional. This is one of the reasons that has kept remittances as well as non-residents transferring money into the country, which helps in growing the economy. With its banking secrecy, and the availability of well-trained bankers working with the best institutions in the world, Lebanon can hope to become the asset management center for the region. For example, just as London is a financial center and Geneva an asset management center, the region could have Dubai as its financial center and Beirut as the asset management center.</p><h4>How do you envision Lebanon's geopolitical role in the region and beyond?</h4><p>In terms of geopolitics, I've always believed that Lebanon should isolate itself from what is going on in the region. I'll do my best to build some sort of a Chinese wall between Lebanon and the rest of the region, meaning that we don't want to interfere in anybody's internal affairs so that no one interferes in ours. Lebanese geopolitics should be based on a zero conflict policy not only with our neighbors (such as the Turkish policy), but the whole world. Lebanon can't afford to jeopardize its relationship with any country in the world. Lebanon will always respect all international resolutions because we can't be selective about which resolution to abide by and which one to reject. In sum, our policy is: zero conflict with everybody, not only our neighbors.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Lebanese banks are famously resilient, providing a vital anchor of stability for the national economy and the entire region. Can you tell us about the prudential measures and other factors that have created this resilience?</h4><p>Most importantly, banks are not allowed to hold any structured products or derivative products on their balance sheets. This was implemented by the central bank, the Banque du Liban, in 2004 before concerns related to the global financial crisis began to emerge. At that time a number of other stringent measures were created, including equity acquisitions that cannot be financed for more than 50% of the value of the investment. We cannot finance real estate development projects for more than 60% of the value of a project, which means leverage is very low and real estate bubbles cannot easily happen in Lebanon. Also, we are not allowed to hold any foreign currency position in excess of 1% of our equity. We have those types of regulations, which represent very important buffers in difficult times. Still, our resiliency is not only related to strict supervision; it also relates to risk aversion at the bank management level. Lebanese banks passed through difficult times in the 1970s and 1980s, which were very difficult years in terms of political turbulence and war. This taught Lebanese bankers high-level risk management. Our ability to manage uncertainties is our main competitive advantage. We are boring banks. By that I mean our business is very easy. We gather customer deposits, which we then use in short-term financing, maintaining at all times high liquidity levels. We don't perform complex transactions. We are deposit-rich banks. Our customer deposits represent almost 82% of our funding.</p><h4>In keeping with this trend, there has already been a 3% increase in deposits in 1H2011 across the board so far. What specifically is driving this growth?</h4><p>I believe those numbers are typical for our country. The discrepancy between the residents and the diaspora makes Lebanon unique. There are 12 million Lebanese spread over five continents, but only 4 million in Lebanon. This diaspora is a successful group that has generated a lot of wealth, and the new waves of immigrants in particular keep sending money back home. Lebanon has the highest remittance per capita worldwide at around $2,000. To put that in context, the total per capita income of non-oil producing countries in the region is around $3,400. In Lebanon itself it is $10,800. Around 40% of inflows are remittances, around 30% is FDI, and the remaining are unilateral transfers. In 1H2011 we witnessed inflows in the range of $6.6 billion, which translated into additional deposits worth $4.3 billion. That's less inflows than in 2010, but the same level of deposit growth.</p><h4>For Bank Audi specifically, your depositor base is about 70% from inside Lebanon and 30% outside. You have a goal to make that ratio 50-50. How will you achieve this?</h4><p>This is one of our most important targets for our regional expansion. When you get to become bigger than your domestic economy, the only way to keep generating economies of scale and efficiency gains is to expand beyond your national boundaries. Our strategy today is two fold. The first is to consolidate and strengthen our domestic leadership as we are the number one bank in Lebanon by far. When you have such a dominant position in your domestic market you have to do everything necessary to further strengthen this position, and we have a team that is focusing exclusively on the domestic franchise. The second aspect is our regional expansion. In mid-2005 our domestic assets represented 98% of our total assets with only two small European subsidiaries. Our domestic assets represented close to 55% of Lebanon's GDP, and this was the trigger. In 2006 we began expanding in the Middle East. There were many case studies that led us to the decision to become a regional bank. Between 2000 and 2006 Arab wealth as measured by consolidated GDP almost tripled from $700 billion to more than $1.9 trillion, triggering a similar growth in bank assets, with the assets-to-GDP ratio still being 1:1. Large individual banks tripled in size, but this never translated to the emergence of real regional players as they still focused on their domestic markets. This is not surprising because there is so much to do in the domestic markets, so why should they bother to go elsewhere? However, the region requires regional intermediation. Yearly inter-Arab trade turnover represents not less than $76 billion. It's not that the business is not covered today, but it is fragmented and partitioned. There is room for regional players to build captive market shares, and that is the motive of our strategy. In terms of individual banking, the region has millions of Arab expatriates from the Levant and North Africa, mostly working in the GCC. We believe we can build a captive market share by providing accounts and products in their home countries and host countries.</p><div class="quote">“Lebanese banks are deposit-rich banks. Our customer deposits represent almost 82% of our funding."</div><h4>What is your outlook for the Lebanese economy over the medium term?</h4><p>The “steady state" level of GDP for Lebanon, which is calculated under the hypothetical that there was no war in the 1970s and 1980s, is $89 billion. This is calculated by looking at the average growth for the preceding 20 years to the outbreak of the 1970s events. This $89 billion corresponds exactly to the ambition of the Lebanese for their standards of living and welfare. There have been huge rehabilitation investments, first undertaken by the government of the late Rafic Hariri in 1992 in rebuilding basic infrastructure, followed by several investments from the private sector to replenish capital assets. More than $50 billion of public and private investments have been made to restore the output capacity of the country. We have witnessed very important growth rates over the last three years because of our resilience, granting the Lebanese considerable competitive advantages during the turmoil. Despite those 8%-9% yearly growth rates in GDP, Lebanon is still facing an output gap of 25%, which means that the actual output of $42 billion could easily be $56 billion. Lebanon can sustain high GDP growth rates in the foreseeable future.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Gemayel Freres has been in the production and sale of corrugated boxes for over 80 years. How have you been able to maintain your status as a significant domestic and global player?<br></h4><p>We have a drive to do business and we want to be in this market. Our past experience shows we have a very strong commitment to this country. Being a family-based company we hold a long-term view of our investments, and are undertaking several investments in machinery and in our professional team. We are a one-stop shop for packaging. We maintain the best relations with our customers, and we have several processes under one roof to cater to the varied needs of our customers. We are sensible, so we listen to what our customers want and we provide the best service, quality-wise and on time.</p><h4>Gemayel Freres is ISO certified and has a sizable staff dedicated to R&amp;D. What is the company's emphasis in reaching high-quality standards and pushing for innovation?</h4><p>We were the first in our field to be ISO certified in 1998, and we have an internal quality system. We bring in international experts to train our employees and they advise us on technical and specific issues. Our strong in-house design team also utilizes very advanced software that allows us to deliver solutions. We are keen on innovation and have matured to move into other areas, particularly the promotional and fast-food markets. These fields always require new innovations and designs, and through collaboration with international groups we sell to across the MENA region. Also, because of our experience and the challenges that we have faced we know a lot about the machines and we perform innovations on the processes themselves.</p><h4>What proportion of your sales came from exports. What are your goals for the company's export/import ratio?</h4><p>Currently we are exporting between 15% and 20% directly. At our sister company BluePack we export maybe 90%, while Solicar exports around 40%. For our Gemayal Freres affiliate we want to reach a point where exports make up around 50% of our sales.</p><div class="quote">“Being a family-based company we hold a long-term view of our investments, and are undertaking several investments in machinery and in our professional team."</div><h4>There are a lot of value-added and high-skilled practices in Lebanese industry. How do you see the industrial sector developing as a whole for the export market?</h4><p>I am totally convinced that we are capable of producing value-added products in Lebanon and exporting them. This is what we are specializing in more and more. As a country in general we are blessed with an important young community of professionals who are capable and relatively competitive with respect to Europe in terms of costs. The cost of taking on an engineer in Lebanon is much less than in Europe, so we can build on Lebanon being a hub for high value-added production. I think there are opportunities for Lebanese companies to be strong partners for European and international groups in their international expansion with Lebanon as a base for exporting to other markets.</p><h4>What should be the role of the private sector in supporting development in Lebanon?</h4><p>We know that as industrialists committed to Lebanon we have a role and as a syndicate with the help of the Swiss Development Agency in association with the Association of Lebanese Industrialists (AIL) and under the management of UNIDO we have established Liban Pack—a Lebanese center for packaging development. The mission of this center is to provide assistance, services, information, best practices, and training to further industrialists who aim to boost their exports to demanding markets.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has your personal experience in Lebanon and the international marketplace helped Alfa contribute to the development of the local telecoms sector?<br></h4><p>Alfa's biggest contribution to the Lebanese telecoms sector in the last 18 months has been upgrading its infrastructure to the latest 3.5G mobile technology, which we expect to launch by the end of September or beginning of October 2011 to our subscribers. My international experience and exposure has given us the know-how that has enabled us as an organization to steadily move forward with 3.5G implementation in Lebanon and to show the Lebanese people that moving to the 3.5G era is the right path for the development of the telecommunications sector and the economy as a whole. Introducing 3.5G in Lebanon is a historical milestone that will give a big boost to our national economy, attract new investments, and spur economic growth.</p><h4>Alfa managed to increase its number of subscribers significantly in 2010. To what do you attribute this growth?</h4><p>The growth in Alfa subscribers was estimated at 22% y-o-y until June 2011 and came as a direct result of the reduced prices that were introduced in 2009—a 30% reduction was applied on both post-paid and pre-paid offers. Also, it was a direct consequence of the decision of the Ministry of Telecommunications to re-invest in the sector. The Alfa network is owned by the government, but is managed by Orascom Telecom Group, a leading private telecoms entity. Therefore, the decision of the Ministry to invest in the network and expand capacity went some way to quell the built-up demand that was out there in the market. Today, Alfa has a total subscriber base of around 1.5 million customers out of a total of 3.1 million mobile users, in a country of only 4.5 million. This means that the cellular penetration rate in Lebanon currently stands at around 75%, which is an acceptable rate but still lagging behind that of neighboring countries, where penetration rates are closer to 100%.</p><h4>What are your expectations for growth in 2011?</h4><p>The objectives we have for 2011 are basically to grow our subscriber base further, especially on the data side. Introducing 3.5G will boost this uptake. From voice and 2G customers, we seek to reach a mobile penetration rate of around 85% in the country—and out of this new growth we intend to grab more than 50% of the market. In 2010, as per the latest report from Arab Advisors Group, we were able to attract 60% of new subscribers. When we, as Orascom Telecom Group, took over the management of the Alfa network back in 2009, Alfa's market share was around 40%, while MTC's share stood at 60%. Today, Alfa's market share stands at 47% to 53% for MTC. Therefore, we have managed to narrow the gap between Alfa and MTC.</p><div class="quote">“Alfa's biggest contribution to the Lebanese telecoms sector in the last 18 months has been upgrading its infrastructure to the latest 3.5G mobile technology."</div><h4>How will the modernization of Lebanon's telecommunications network open up the sector to multinationals?</h4><p>Dubai is home to numerous multinational companies. One of the reasons for being based there is the ease of connectivity to the rest of the world. If Lebanon sees an improved situation and connectivity comes back to the country, there is no reason why people won't choose Lebanon. Introducing 3.5G will open this door, through facilitating starting new businesses in Lebanon and encouraging international and regional organizations to establish their head or regional offices in Beirut. We want to start by driving the telecoms industry in Lebanon at the fastest possible pace in order to bridge the gap we still have today between other countries in the region and beyond since telecoms is a horizontal growth engine that can positively impact many other sectors, such as health, education, and banking.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Your latest residential real estate project, Beirut Terraces, aims to be a “vertical village." Can you tell us about this concept and how it meets market demand?</h4><p>We listened to potential dwellers talk about Beirut as it was in the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, when gardens, low-rises, privacy, intimacy, and individuality characterized the streets and neighborhoods. Today this residential identity is changing rapidly as the city mushrooms vertically. The thought of a townhouse can no longer be entertained as soaring land prices force value to be extracted by height. We decided that if we were going vertical, then it would be in the form of a “vertical village," thereby engendering an individual identity, such as that acquired by a village over time, but in a mid-town property. We wanted to create a place where the outdoor lifestyle could be enjoyed for at least 10 months of the year, keeping a connection with the old streets of Beirut blossoming with the smell of jasmine.</p><p>We believe the epitome of real estate success is when people discover a particular place that they feel is in harmony with their identity. For the last 25 years we have been advising developers around the globe. Beirut Terraces (BT) is not another building, it is conceived with particular attention to its urban framework and its value-added to the downtown's physical and environmental assets. Our development approach is based on a deep understanding of urban planning fundamentals such as eco-friendliness, sustainability, accessibility, life cycles, and density. BT represents the helm of quality design, quality of construction, and quality of finishing for those who appreciate rarity but simplicity at the same time. Our years of practice push us to think beyond the immediate location of a project and the initial financial implications. We prioritize value, community, and lifestyle. Value has a cascading effect, in turn influencing social spheres, as well as the value of the land and the local economy. Delivering value is our way of being socially responsible.</p><h4>After a competitive selection process involving four world-renowned architecture firms, you chose Herzog &amp; De Meuron for Beirut Terraces. How was the decision made?</h4><p>We sought a certain level of architecture that is truly “glocal" and that could also bring value to the city and to the country. We selected three practices to submit designs for the Beirut Terraces: Richard Rogers (UK), Herzon &amp; De Meuron (Switzerland), and Raphael Viñoly (US). The three of them competed on this building and they provided us with outstanding solutions. Unfortunately, we had to select one design that offered the most differentiation within the context of Beirut. Herzog &amp; De Meuron put forward the design that was selected for its distinctness, guaranteed to differentiate itself amongst the surrounding glass blocks of buildings. We were also interested in the work done by Herzog &amp; De Meuron in the past; specifically a building resembling Beirut Terraces in New York, which escaped the New York style and challenged the mind and the spirit of what developers would accept. We liked that.</p><div class="quote">“Our development approach is based on the deep understanding of urban planning fundamentals."</div><h4>Can you tell us about your activities outside of Lebanon?</h4><p>Benchmark is a three-year-old company. We started as a spin-off from a development management company we started 14 years ago. That company was sold back to one of the founders, who took it over and maintains it as a development management company. We wanted to set the benchmarks for real estate investment development and management, and that is the basis of our practice. We started with our first project in Solidere called Wadi Hills as a small investment with a group of investors. We grew from running a $145 million project to BT, which is worth just under $500 million. By the end of 2011 we will have a few more projects coming that will add another $650 million to our portfolio and, as a result—and despite all the odds—our projects in Lebanon will end up with a net value of approximately $1.3 billion.</p><p>Within these three years we have had the opportunity to expand to a few other countries including Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar. We have invested in a Solidere International project in Ajman and are waiting for the completion of infrastructure and civil works in 2013. Our project in Saudi Arabia encompasses an entire urban community on the fringe of the capital, promising middle-income Saudis an affordable yet quality home with full-scale amenities and services. This project will contribute a major gateway to the city. We have recently been assigned as development managers to one of Qatar's most valuable projects in the heart of Doha's residential districts. This project will be presented in Doha's first edition of Cityscape. Benchmark has further plans in Europe and Africa, and we hope to launch these activities in the next two years.</p><h4>What is your vision for the future of Beirut's cityscape?</h4><p>Beirut's cityscape is very difficult to imagine in the future. It's overbuilt, it's massive, and it's very difficult to improve the road network. Better accessibility to services and open spaces is much required to make it a 21st century city. It is very similar to congested cities, but has pockets of hope that could be seeds for another generation. These pockets of hope are in various places, and Solidere is one of them, serving as an example for other places. It has become so attractive to investors, residents, and developers alike that there is no way but to try and replicate the design value created. Competitive advantage has allowed for an overall improvement among developers over the last decade in terms of creating design value and quality of buildings delivered. People now speak of real estate in terms of luxury standards, better location, and value within apartments. The city has started to resurface despite its overall image, and this gives us reason to have hope. As Lebanese hope is in our blood, at Benchmark value by design is a part of our DNA.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-point-of-delivery]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the extent of Agility's operations in Lebanon?</h4><p>Agility Lebanon was first established in 2004, when its name was Public Warehousing Company (PWC). At the end of 2006 we changed the name globally. We offer freight forwarding, airfreight, sea freight, overland transportation, imports, exports, warehousing, and distribution services. We deliver to more than 3,000 points of sale to our customers in Lebanon. In terms of size, combining all of our products, we are number one by far in Lebanon. However, we face tough competition in every sub-segment we operate in. Having said that, we have a more developed end-to-end supply chain than most of our competitors. We perform cargo shipment, customs clearance, warehousing, and delivery regardless of size or weight. We are equipped to deal with all types of projects, plus the day-to-day business we are involved in.</p><h4>What sectors create the greatest demand for shipment needs?</h4><p>We see the greatest demand from the FMCG and electronics sectors. We cover a wide variety of sectors and provide our services across the entire country. Our key clients are among the top-10 companies in the country, plus of course a wide variety of medium-size clients.</p><h4>What is the scope for domestic distribution services in Lebanon?</h4><p>We own a full fleet composed of more than 60 pickups and trucks with different temperatures—frozen, chilled, and ambient—and we lease more than 20. This translates up to 100-140 domestic trips daily.</p><div class="quote">“We own a full fleet composed of more than 60 pickups and trucks with different temperatures—frozen, chilled, and ambient."</div><h4>How much support and coordination is provided from Agility's worldwide network?</h4><p>There is a strong level of coordination, as Agility is present around the world and in the region. We also operate a backup system in order to avoid any disasters—a system that is also used in Kuwait and Singapore. If Agility's integrated software receives updates, we receive those updates at the same time as any other arm of the company anywhere in the world. We are one of the very few global companies that has such a solution in the Lebanese market.</p><h4>What is the capacity of your storage warehouses?</h4><p>We have more than six warehouses in the country, all of them in Beirut or within the Greater Beirut area. In terms of size we are number one by far, more than 100,000 cbm. In terms of workforce, we employ more than 400 people totally including those in the warehouses.</p><h4>What are the advantages of using Lebanon as a distribution hub?</h4><p>Operating in Lebanon provides an advantage when distributing to the Levant countries such as Syria, Jordan, and Iraq. This is an excellent hub for these countries in terms of land freight and transit time. We have many projects and they have turned out very well for our clients and for us.</p><h4>How has the company grown in Lebanon?</h4><p>In 2010 we experienced tremendous growth. We grew more than 40% over the previous year. For 2011 we are hoping for nearly the same growth rate, with projections at 30%, depending on the economic situation in the region and neighboring countries. Border traffic hasn't slowed down dramatically if we exclude the first month when the Arab spring started, despite the unrest in neighboring countries.</p><h4>What makes operating in Lebanon unique?</h4><p>One unique aspect to Lebanon is its sensitivity. During downturns the market is very susceptible to drops in confidence; however, when things begin to look up, the economy begins booming. This allows companies to make quick comebacks following crisis.</p><h4>What are your main export destinations?</h4><p>Our main export markets are Asia and Europe. We are definitely an import country, however, so for every export shipment there are 10 import shipments. Because of the volume our focus is on imports coming from Germany, Italy, and France on the European side, though China is definitely number one on the Asian side. And over the last couple of years we have noticed that the US has increased its market share in Lebanon.</p><h4>What is Agility Lebanon's strategy for growth?</h4><p>We still want to grow and we still want to be dominant in the market in every single department, as we are not there yet. In the long term we see much opportunity. So far, we have made investments into Lebanon totaling more than $20 million. Our current project is for a new warehouse, which will be a state-of-the-art facility including frozen, chilled, and ambient capacities. Our appetite does not stop in terms of investing in the country. This is our commitment to our clients, key accounts, and future clients. Given complications in the market today, clients approach us and they see that we have the same service capabilities as in any other country. The large names approach us either because they deal with us in other countries or because they know the name.</p><h4>How have you risen as a dominant player in the market?</h4><p>We differentiate ourselves by the level of services we provide. We have management systems in every single warehouse, wireless connections, and radio frequency identity tag readers, so we can capture serial numbers and expiration dates. We also include our customers' orders in our directory, allowing for instant access to their shipping needs.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-strong-mix]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of Debbane-Saikali Group's core business activities in Lebanon and the MENA region?<br></h4><p>We have private investments, but we don't have private businesses. It is strictly a family business. We've developed in various fields, depending on the expertise of each member of the family. Ten years ago 30% of our total turnover was from outside of Lebanon. Now, 70% of it is externally generated. Our aim is to bring that external experience to Lebanon and the Lebanese. It was very hard for the Lebanese to get established overseas between 1975 and 1990, and many airports were closed and so on. Therefore, we instead decided to diversify in Lebanon. We started with inputs for farmers, including fertilizers, pesticides, and seeds. We introduced plastic greenhouses to the Middle East, and we introduced drip irrigation. We started in Lebanon and then expanded outwards. From 1990 we started expanding outward, to Syria, Iraq, the Gulf, Jordan, and Algeria. We diversified both in terms of the fields we were active in and geographically. We now have 1,600 employees in the group, which, compared to Europe is small, but not so small for the Middle East. We are very proud of our business and instill a family spirit among our employees.</p><h4>How has Debbane-Saikali Group diversified over the years?</h4><p>We started off in agriculture, and with the reconstruction process in Lebanon that started after 1990, which marked the end of the civil war, we expanded into the construction sector and established the first ready-mix concrete production in Lebanon. With European partners we also built chemical factories, of which we have seven now all over the Middle East. We built those in conjunction with very well-known French group, Saint-Gobain. We are also in the telecommunications business, in data communication, though not mobile communications. We enable 15 banks in Lebanon to set up direct 24-hour links with all their branches. We also branched out into the field of wine. We like wine and this business is more for pleasure than for profit, but it also became a good business. Another one of the companies of the group is Exotica, a horticulture group, which is well known for its top-quality products and services. One of my brothers manages Exotica, and they work with a very creative advertising agency. Exotica has been around since 1978, and it is active in retail, in large landscaping projects, events, and weddings.</p><h4>How did you develop your partnership with Saint-Gobain and others?</h4><p>It has great know-how and experience, and we try and learn from those who have that kind of a track record. We built chemical factories, and we are now also working together in wine production, which we started in 2008. The Chairman and CEO of Nissan, Carlos Ghosn, is a wine lover and he wanted to produce wine in Lebanon, so he began looking for partners. He found us to be the best option for this partnership. Our first wine came out on the market in 2008. Our brand Ixsir is being marketed around the world. Hubert de Beauvoir of Chateau Angelus was willing to offer us his consulting services too, which was an honor for us.</p><div class="quote">“We like wine and this business is more for pleasure than for profit, but it also became a good business."</div>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe Lebanon's economic and financial role in the region?<br></h4><p>Lebanon plays a prominent role in the Middle East and Arab world, given its geographical position as a crossroads between East and West and at a strategic location on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea. Furthermore, Lebanon's free economic policy in addition to the various features of its banking sector have all contributed to granting Lebanon a leading role at the economic and financial levels in the region, particularly during the pre-war period. Nowadays, and after the reconstruction process and achieving stability and security, Lebanon has regained its regionally distinct role, which has had a positive impact on its economic growth, scoring thus between 8% and 9% over the past four years, in spite of persistent Israeli threats and the war of July 2006. In this context, I would like to underscore the role of Lebanese citizens in reinforcing Lebanon's position in the region, for the Lebanese are distinguished by their culture while remaining up-to-date with the latest technologies.</p><h4>In what key sectors would you like to see Lebanon place more emphasis on to develop the economy and provide jobs?</h4><div class="quote">“Lebanon has regained its regionally distinct role, which has had a positive impact on its economic growth."</div><p>Lebanon has always been a leading name in the world of trade and services in addition to its high standards in the fields of tourism, education, and health care. That is why we are always keen to develop these areas to maintain Lebanon's status. Moreover, other sectors such as industry and agriculture generate income for many citizens and provide numerous job opportunities for the Lebanese youth. We must not forget the importance of the Lebanese banking sector, which proved to be vital for the Lebanese economy after it demonstrated its capacity to withstand and overcome crises thanks to the financial and banking policies adopted by successive Lebanese governments and the Banque du Liban. Lebanon's banking resilience asserted itself during the recent global financial crisis when Lebanese financial and banking policy was considered a policy to be emulated by other countries. In fact, despite the political problems Lebanon faced, its economic sectors, especially the banking sector, maintained steady growth over the past years. Our primary concern has been to reduce the interdependence between the economic and the political sector for the Lebanese economy to gain more stability and develop its potential.</p><h4>How does Lebanon maintain its ability to attract foreign direct investment?</h4><p>During the past years, Lebanon constituted a safe haven for foreign investments. Investments in Lebanon posted an annual growth of 14% to 15% between 2003 and 2009; indeed, the value of investments neared $4.8 billion in 2010, particularly thanks to the economic and financial policies adopted in addition to the facilities granted to investors aimed at encouraging the latter to invest in Lebanon. Beyond a shadow of doubt, maintaining security and stability in Lebanon will strengthen its ability to attract foreign investment, especially given the recent political and security developments in many countries of the region.</p><h4>How does Lebanon's substantial diaspora contribute to the development of the Lebanese economy?</h4><p>The Lebanese diaspora has played a crucial role in Lebanon's economic development; it has been a fundamental pillar during all the periods the country has gone through because of the money transfers and their persistence in investing in Lebanon. As a matter of fact, money transfers issued by Lebanese expatriates exceeded $7 billion in 2009. This is a clear indicator of the Lebanese people's attachment to their motherland and their complete confidence in its future. Moreover, among the Lebanese diaspora are investors with an entrepreneurial spirit that constitute a continuous springboard effect for sustainable economic growth from a capital- and knowledge-transfer perspective. Therefore, it is a must that strong bonds are maintained and consolidated with the Lebanese diaspora. Hence my keenness to meet with members of the Lebanese diaspora, discuss with them their problems and recommendations, and put their suggestions at the service of the nation.</p><h4>What steps are being taken to reduce the country's public debt?</h4><p>Lebanon's public debt, which nowadays exceeds $50 billion, is not a recent problem; it is a result of the events the country has gone through, after which a huge reconstruction process was necessary to rebuild what was destroyed. We have taken several steps to try to contain the aggravated public debt by replacing these debts with less expensive ones through the Paris I, Paris II, and Paris III Conferences, rationalizing spending, and seeking incomes to cover the cost of servicing the public debt, a cost that constitutes the bulk of the public budget each year.</p><h4>What coordination would you like to see between the public and private sector in economic development?</h4><p>The private sector has demonstrated its competence in project management and its resourceful ability to generate funds. Therefore, it is pertinent to take advantage of the capabilities and expertise of the private sector by establishing a partnership between the private and public sectors. This partnership proved its usefulness in many areas, particularly in the field of telecommunications. In addition, there are many areas the private sector could greatly contribute to, namely those of electricity, transportation, petroleum, and infrastructure. However, we need to draft in parallel laws and devise systems for this partnership to be beneficial to all parties and prevent monopolies, and that is what we are working on at this stage.</p><h4>What efforts are being made to attract investment to regions outside of the greater Beirut area?</h4><p>The system is weighed down by administrative centralization and unbalanced development. That is why most administrations and investments are concentrated in Beirut, while there are many Lebanese regions suffering from poverty and deprivation due to the accumulations of the past years. We are striving to solve this problem by developing a strategy for balanced development across the different regions of Lebanon. Moreover, efforts are being deployed to draft a decentralization law.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the Lebanese economy in the medium term?</h4><p>Lebanon possesses an array of capabilities and competences that must be seized on to develop its economy. Furthermore, Lebanon has relatively abundant natural resources that can be utilized, like water, for example. Furthermore, studies underline the presence of oil and gas in Lebanon, and a law was passed regulating the exploration and investment in this richness. Lebanon's economic future is promising and we have many opportunities we can capitalize on, yet the most vital prerequisite remains maintaining security and stability in the country. Consequently, we have always sought to bring the opinions of various parties closer and uphold constructive dialogue among them, for that would serve our beloved country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In terms of the 2012 budget, what steps is your Ministry planning to take to manage the deficit?<br></h4><p>We are hoping to present our budget to the government in September 2011. There is a lot of work being done, as the last budget was in 2005. All the over-expenditure of that time period will be settled and approved by the Lebanese parliament. For the budget itself we want to make plain that we will improve the ratio of our indebtedness to GDP. We are looking to improve, and therefore we will be strict on our expenditures, although we will have a heavy demand for investment in the energy, water, and transport sectors. We then need the private sector to follow up on these investments. Additionally, we are hoping to pass a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) law that will open the way for investment in infrastructure.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the PPP law?</h4><div class="quote">“If we need to expand our economy, then yes we need to borrow, but we have to do that prudently."</div><p>We want to invest in making sure we have a cheap source of energy, which is gas. Furthermore, it is important for us that Lebanon gains a regular supply. Therefore, the government will follow through on any investment that is needed in that field. As such, the generation of electricity will interest the private sector, as it is much more generation-focused. The Lebanese government will maintain ownership of the transmission of electricity, and so the investment in transmission will mostly be from the Lebanese government side. For roads, I know it is difficult maybe at this point to start a toll system, but it is something that we have to look at. It is important for us to solve many of our traffic problems—there are only three main roads leading out of Beirut and this is putting pressure on us. The cabinet has also confirmed that we need to begin improving the utilization of rail, especially in order to connect the north with the south of the country. It will help alleviate a lot of the transport problems.</p><h4>What steps should be taken to make sure economic growth is equitable throughout the country?</h4><p>We have to integrate the remote areas more effectively into the capital Beirut by enhancing the communication and transportation infrastructure. In that regard, it is doubly important for us to develop the rail network. For example, being able to travel from Beirut to Tripoli in 45 minutes will be very important for Lebanese citizens. This will also open up Lebanon to investment as it will widen the scope for the placement of factories and so on.</p><h4>Successive governments have divested from agriculture. Do you think this is an area in which investment would be beneficial?</h4><p>Unfortunately, agriculture was neglected until everyone started talking about food security. However, roughly 10% to 15% of the population works in agriculture. Yet agriculture accounts for only 5% of our GDP. Today, we have a high rate of unemployment relative to other countries. If more opportunities for employment can be created in the field of agriculture then it will be welcomed. We are also interested in developing more food industries linked to agriculture. Lebanon has proved itself to be strong in the food industry, and our export markets in this area have been relatively lucrative. There have been mistakes in the past regarding quality, but since then tremendous work has been done to improve standards. We are now more confident that when we open an export market, we can continuously supply it with quality products and foodstuffs.</p><h4>In your efforts to improve the debt-to-GDP ratio, how important is improving efficiencies on the revenue collection side?</h4><p>Improving efficiencies on the revenue collection side is very important as all people are concerned with it, although the expenditure side has to be seen at the end. There is a lot of work that has been started recently and will be carried out in that field. Some of the laws were not being enforced properly. However, we have taken a decision to decisively enforce all laws in this respect.</p><p>Your administration has been known around the world to be business friendly. What steps are being taken to promote investment opportunities, and where do you think are the most fruitful opportunities in Lebanon right now?</p><p>Some years ago we established the Investment Development Authority of Lebanon (IDAL), and it is a one-stop shop for any foreign investor to get all the support and waivers needed for an investment. In that respect, IDAL is functioning to support foreign investors in the country and support the export of Lebanese products to other countries. Having said that, something I have instigated since becoming the Minister of Economy is improved coordination with international agencies that expedite foreign capital investment to countries like Lebanon. We are trying to encourage foreign investors to use the World Bank-related Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) services or other agencies to give them peace of mind that their investment in Lebanon is safe. Foreign investors think of these issues and it is normal, but if you can insure capital through the World Bank, I think it creates a good feeling in foreign investors. We are trying to couple a lot of the investments in our infrastructure by including insurance, so that investors will feel more comfortable and secure. And also, by the same token, it gives a guarantee for Lebanese capital that is to be invested in other countries, especially in Africa. For us this is also good if you want to invest in other countries that are facing some difficulties.</p><h4>How important is Lebanon's very robust financial system to you in terms of managing the deficit?</h4><p>We have to be prudent in everything we do, and it is important that we meet our debt obligations. We have honored all of our debts throughout our history. We have an excellent track record, and we hope to maintain it. We have never failed on any payment. If we need to expand our economy, then yes we need to borrow, but we have to do that prudently. We can service our debt, and we will be fine. Most importantly, we want to make sure that our ratio of debt to GDP is always decreasing.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-watchful-eye]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is Lebanon's strategy for tackling financial crises different from other countries in the region?</h4><p>Lebanon's history has been characterized by long periods of political bickering and instabilities to which the Lebanese economy has successfully developed immunity. In fact, sustained remittances from Lebanese expatriates continue to serve as a lifeline to the economy, preventing it from collapsing in the event of unanticipated shocks. Lebanon's strategy for coping with financial crises revolves around the sustainable role of its central banking arm (the Banque du Liban) in strengthening the banking sector's resilience through prudent monetary policy and close supervision. Added to this are the conservative credit policies and strong capitalization levels of the banks, which together have so far succeeded in averting the spillover of any major financial crisis on Lebanon. The live-tested resilience of Lebanon during the various phases of political unrest was the driver behind the attraction of remittances from Lebanese expatriates and capital inflows from international investors eyeing Lebanon as a destination for their investments, particularly during periods of turbulent regional markets. This is measured by increasing FDI levels, which have increased by 3.14% y-o-y to $4.96 billion in 2010, up from $4.80 billion in 2009, with capital inflows to Lebanon nearing $21 billion in 2009 and surpassing the $17 billion mark in 2010. Paradoxically, when the international economy was suffering from the repercussions of the global financial crisis, the Lebanese economy recorded unprecedented real growth rates of 9.3% in 2008, 8.5% in 2009, and 7.5% in 2010 according to the latest IMF statistics.</p><h4>What steps are being taken by the banking sector to jumpstart the economy and increase activity?</h4><p>The Banque du Liban and the Association of Banks in Lebanon (ABL) have continuously strived to foster the private sector's involvement in the economy on the back of its vital contribution to spurring economic growth. More particularly, the banking sector has been multiplying efforts to stimulate its activity and exploit the excess liquidity by engineering products and services designated for the various sectors of the economy, namely the agricultural, civic, and social sectors. In addition, the Banque du Liban has been proactive in promulgating laws and circulars aimed at promoting investments within and by the private sector. In this context, and in an attempt to address the high liquidity overhang at Lebanese banks, the central bank lowered the reserve requirements on LBP credit facilities by 60% during the 2009-2011 period, an aspect that helped fuel LBP lending at commercial banks to unprecedented levels.</p><h4>Is lending more focused on the private sector or the public sector? Which areas are in the most need?</h4><p>The Lebanese banking sector has undoubtedly played a major role in smoothing government public finances and alleviating external debt. Lebanese banks remain the major subscriber to Lebanese Eurobonds and other governmental instruments denominated in both domestic and foreign currencies. More recently, Lebanese banks shifted their lending strategy more in favor of the private sector, with the share of loans to the private sector reaching around 57% of the total lending portfolio as of the end of May 2011, and claims on the public sector eased to 43%. Central bank incentives for private sector borrowings include a range of subsidies that could attain 700 basis points on loans extended to the tourism, agricultural, industrial, handicrafts, and IT sectors. It is worth noting that subsidized loans reached $774.73 million in 2010, up from $543.68 million in 2009 and $163.52 million in 2003. In addition, we have seen in recent years new directives by the ABL and the Banque du Liban that foster the growth of SMEs in addition to more favorably weighing micro-financing given their important role in accentuating economic growth. This comes in light of the robust demand for private sector lending, the government's policy to curb the piling of the public debt burden, and international rating agencies' recommendations for the banking sector to reduce its exposure to the sovereign.</p><div class="quote">“The Lebanese economy recorded unprecedented real growth rates of 9.3% in 2008, 8.5% in 2009, and 7.5% in 2010."</div><h4>Do you perceive the increase in capital inflows into the country as a sign of increased confidence?</h4><p>During times of a global recession, waning global investment activity, and squeezed liquidity levels, Lebanon paradoxically succeeded at maintaining unprecedented levels of capital inflows and FDI, which propelled real GDP growth way above regional and international levels. More particularly, capital inflows burgeoned from around $11 billion in 2007, to $16.1 billion in 2008, $20.6 billion in 2009, and $17 billion in 2010. Concurrently, the level of net FDI accelerated from $3.38 billion in 2007 to $4.33 billion in 2008, $4.80 billion in 2009, and $4.96 billion in 2010. Said rosy figures can be mainly attributed to the regained confidence in the economy during the aforementioned period in addition to the less distressed domestic political scene and the uninterrupted flow of remittances from the Lebanese diaspora living in the Gulf. The recent revolutionary changes in political regimes in the Arab region have obviously hampered Lebanon's prosperous economic realm, to a certain extent, until the recent formation of the new government in June 2011. These factors did not go unnoticed, with capital inflows shedding some $1.65 billion during the first tier of 2011 to $4.15 billion, down from $5.8 billion during the same period last year, and net foreign direct investments dipping by 60% y-o-y to some $1 billion in the first five months of 2011. Nevertheless, remittances from Lebanese expatriates, which constituted a substantial 22% ($8.2 billion) share of Lebanon's 2010 GDP, are expected to sustain healthy levels in the upcoming period, and thus dilute any unfavorable contraction in capital inflows.</p><h4>What does it mean for the Lebanese to be ahead of countries in the region for Basel III changes/compliance?</h4><p>The Lebanese banking sector has always been among the pioneers in implementing international norms, reinforcing as such the sector's image and credibility on the international scale. As for compliance with Basel III requirements, Lebanon and China were the first two countries in the world to start adopting the different phases of Basel III, which reiterates the Lebanese banking sector's robust adequacy and capitalization levels. This would unquestionably provide Lebanese banks with a capital buffer to shield them from the repercussions of unexpected shocks or alleged accusations that may put the sector's reputation at risk. The Lebanese banking sector has at present a minimum tier one ratio of 7% (according to Basel III), with expectations to reach 10% in the few coming years, way ahead of the January 2019 deadline set by the Basel committee.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us how Demco Steel came about?<br></h4><p>Demco Steel was originally established by my great-grandfather. He changed his last name to Demirdjian over 100 years ago, a name which is derived from the word for iron-maker in Turkish. Since then, several generations have been successfully engaged in the iron and steel business, and today the company has become one of the biggest players in the Middle East, especially in Lebanon, where we enjoy the largest market share and are a well-known name in the Lebanese economy.</p><h4></h4><h4>What is the size of your company?</h4><p>With local and trading activities, we have over 350 employees and our sales should be north of $500 million in 2011.</p><h4>How have you seen the sector change over the past few years?</h4><p>Price volatility over the past five years with anything related to commodities has been extremely volatile and at times unpredictable. The challenges we face in working in this environment are enormous, and since we are also involved in shipping, where volatility was of epic proportions, timing was essential. No matter how sound your business model, and how competitive a company is, if the timing is off then it's all over. Steel prices fluctuated and at times increased/decreased more than four fold during this time frame. Good capitalization was essential for us to be able to ride those waves and adapt to such market conditions. Being a step ahead helped us turn this volatility to our advantage, and this in turn enabled Demco to become unchallenged as the market leader in Lebanon.</p><div class="quote">“Being a step ahead helped us turn this volatility to our advantage."</div><h4>What business sectors are important to Demco Steel?</h4><p>The business sectors important to Demco Steel are mainly in construction and industry. The construction sector constitutes around 60% to 70% of our business.</p><h4>To what extent do you work with the government?</h4><p>We rarely deal directly with the government. However, owing to Lebanon's unfortunate history, there has been a lot of construction and reconstruction going on from the private as well as the public sector. The government appoints private contractors to undertake projects, and they in turn use our products. We have supplied steel products for the construction of airports, road and bridge networks, dams, a sports stadium, and a significant portion of the Downtown Beirut project.</p><h4>What kind of projects have you been involved with in the private sector?</h4><p>The prices of land and real estate have skyrocketed of late, creating a strong level of demand for almost any residential or commercial space. Almost all forms of construction require steel. We are therefore very much involved in the private sector construction industry.</p><h4>What is behind this growth in local construction activity?</h4><p>There are more than 10 million Lebanese living outside of Lebanon. Each and every one of them has a strong sense of attachment to their homeland because they either have family members still living here or they feel nostalgic about the country. Many Lebanese were uprooted during the civil war period and reluctantly left to find new opportunities. Many of them return to buy real estate and property so they can feel that they still belong here. They are convinced that at some point in the future they will come back to Lebanon and retire. This creates a lot of demand and provides a considerable amount of support for the market. These same people transfer considerable amounts of funds back home to Lebanon, which makes our banking sector extremely liquid and helps prices move up even more thanks to the abundant loan programs that have been made easily available.</p><h4>What is your export/import ratio?</h4><p>Out of our total production, around 25% to 30% is exported. The rest is destined for the local market.</p><h4>Which countries do you work with?</h4><p>We mainly work with countries situated around the Mediterranean Basin, though our activities are not limited to that region alone. Market conditions sometimes allow Demco to make plays in China or South America. This really depends on the economic conditions in each area.</p><h4>What are the advantages of manufacturing in Lebanon?</h4><p>Lebanon has a good geographic location in the Middle East. With today's shipping rates and fuel prices, this helps in making our exports to the area relatively cheap. We also enjoy good quality labor at very reasonable wages. Such wage differences and the low level of labor constraints work significantly to our advantage if we compare Lebanon to other modern economies.</p><h4>Do you have any plans to expand your production facilities?</h4><p>Nothing should stay static. It is natural for things to change. The notion of staying idle is very akin to death. If we don't expand at some point, we will lose our edge and die, just like the cells in our body. Every day we are looking to expand and add to our production line. However, even more importantly, we must also diversify our range of products and activities. In addition to our growth in the steel sector, we have also entered into many other forms of investments. Demco Group is active in the development of several 300-unit real estate projects in Beirut as well as real estate projects in Lebanon's mountain resorts. We are also involved in the shipping industry, where we regularly buy and sell bulker ships. We are currently increasing our exposure in this sector as we believe that the market has bottomed out for now.</p><h4>How do you think the image of Lebanon will change for investors in the coming years?</h4><p>Our recent history was not foreign investor friendly, as a result of too much instability and a lack of transparency. However, we are now the only country in the Middle East that has not been affected by the Arab spring movement. The growth and enhancement of democracy in the region should be positive in that respect for our growth prospects.</p><h4>What are Demco Steel's future goals?</h4><p>Since we are heavily involved in this part of the world, I think we will now focus a little more on our shipping business, as this is where I see the best opportunities. More importantly, having the entire world to market to is certainly a nice challenge.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What services does Cedarcom Group provide to the Lebanese IT market?</h4><p>We operate the largest wireless broadband operator in Lebanon. We cater for three sectors of the market. The first is the multi-branch-office market, where we securely interconnect the branches of banks and other businesses. The other sector that we cater to is the residential market, where we offer mobile broadband wireless services via USB dongles, Wi-Fi routers, or similar means, and third we serve the enterprise sector's high-end internet needs. Basically, we cater for the whole data and internet eco-chain in Lebanon.</p><h4>How do you see the potential for progress in the Lebanese telecommunications sector?</h4><p>The potential is huge and leapfrogging from the slowest broadband country (current in 186th position) to a top-10 country can happen in less than a year. What Lebanon needs is to enforce fair competition among operators and give security to investors. With the current anti-competitive practices by state-owned operators and one-year renewable licenses to private operators, Lebanon is unlikely to see any serious investments or innovations led by the private sector. The Lebanese people have the financials, the knowledge, and the will. What is needed is a proper regulatory framework that implements fair competition between state and private operators.</p><h4>How does your wireless network compare to that of your competitors?</h4><p>We've outgrown all our competitors. When we came to the market in 2004, our competitors controlled the market; prices were high and the service quality was barely acceptable. The largest operator controlled over 50% of the market, but today we're proudly the largest. Our strategy was eight times the speed at 80% of the price. We shook pricing and service quality and forced our competitors to re-invest in their outdated infrastructure. We had a very clear-cut strategy, and we executed it with passion and excellence. We invested in the right technology at the right time.</p><div class="quote">“We had a very clear-cut strategy, and we executed it with passion and excellence."</div><h4>What developments are underway as far as updating your network?</h4><p>We're currently planning to invest $15 million in a new network build out, yet some shareholders are very cautious and are concerned to take this step. Though it is the right step to take, it might not be welcomed by the Ministry because we will compete with the state-owned operators.</p><h4>What are the biggest issues you face in establishing a better level of competition and higher service standards in Lebanon?</h4><p>The government imposes direct and indirect taxes on private operators like us of up to 59%, while state-owned operators are exempt from paying such taxes. State operators are classified as Significant Market Powers (SMPs), and they have the tendency to subsidize the cost of broadband services through the profits generated by voice services. These factors make competition impossible. Even if we offer a faster, superior service vis-í -vis the state operators, the fact is that the state operators have high fiscal advantages and subsidies, and they are able to sell a service at a lower rate than our own. In this respect, how can we compete? The telecoms regulators impose restrictions on SMP operators in order to prohibit any fiscal imbalance, while subsidies led to the creation of “monopolies" in telecoms, and as we all know monopolies are a consumer's worst enemy. Unfortunately, the regulator in Lebanon is not playing its role to the fullest and the unfair competition is strengthening day by day.</p><h4>Why isn't the government imposing a more level playing field for all operators, whether public or private?</h4><p>The previous Minister of Telecommunications, Gibran Bassil, was savvy and aware of the threat of creating additional monopolies. He published the famous General Rules for Regulating Telecommunication Services in May 2009, which were totally oriented with the clear-cut objective of converting Lebanon into an information-based society. He advocated fairness in competition, proper licensing, and listing the state operators' shares on the Beirut Stock Exchange, among other things. Unfortunately, until now, these General Rules have not been implemented.</p><h4>What impact do you see 3G having on the country?</h4><p>The way things are going today, 3G will be a reason for joy amongst consumers in the short term, but will turn out to be a nightmare over the long term since the government will monopolize the telecoms sector leading to the exodus of the private sector. When this happens there will be no incentive for the monopoly to invest in a cash-cow business, as we saw in the past. Lebanon was once the innovator in adopting GSM services, but 15 years later we can barely make a call without the line dropping. Accordingly, services will deteriorate in no time, and the first to suffer will be the consumer with less than satisfactory and expensive services, whereas on a larger scale the economy will miss out on huge investment opportunities. Forcing the private sector out would mean the closure of 23 companies that employ over 1,000 people. This will have a big impact on the economy of a small country like Lebanon. There is no question that introducing 3G is a necessity for Lebanon; however, it should be accompanied by the appropriate licensing in line with Telecoms Law No. 431 and with the right set of regulations that encourage the private sector to invest on the grounds of fair competition. If this is accomplished, then all stakeholders, whether users, operators, or the government, will come out as winners ready to make e-Lebanon a reality.</p><h4>What is your hope for the future of broadband in Lebanon?</h4><p>We are calling for broadband to be a “human right" in Lebanon. We communicated that to the Prime Minister, to the Minister of Telecommunications and to the Telecoms Regulatory Authority. In countries such as Finland, Greece, and Spain, broadband has already been made a human right, and this is what we want for Lebanon. We live in a small country and giving access to a 20 Mbps connection within Lebanon is not farfetched.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As a financial institution specializing in real estate development and private equity investment, what markets is MENA Capital looking at regionally?</h4><p>As of 2010 we have been expanding into markets such as Iraq, where we have been buying properties in select areas, which we plan to develop later. In the future we envisage the company having activities in more markets in the region.</p><h4>What are the main development projects MENA Capital is currently involved with?</h4><p>We are working on four high-rise buildings in Lebanon and we are looking to do more toward the later half of 2011 and early 2012. We try to sequence our projects and plan to deliver three of them in 2011 so that we will have the capacity to grow into other areas.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the Sky Gate development?</h4><p>Sky Gate is really the hallmark project for MENA Capital and the country. It will be the most luxurious building in the region, not just in Lebanon.</p><div class="quote">“This country has an abundance of quality human capital and a tremendously resourceful and loyal diaspora."</div><h4>How does the Sky Gate project differ from a typical building design in Beirut?</h4><p>The building is unique because of its location, being at the highest point in Beirut. We have worked hard especially on the design, quality finishing, and amenities for the building. The development contains around 3,000 sqm of landscaping and is the only building that has indoor and outdoor amenities and a running track stretching one-third of a kilometer around the gardens of the building. Finally, the project will be adopting eco-friendly standards.</p><h4>How do you finance your projects?</h4><p>We normally have several sources of financing, primarily supplied by our investors. We create investment vehicles and use the money to develop our projects. We also partner with landowners, thereby not sinking all of our capital into the land itself. Another important source of finance is the buyers in our projects, who allow us to become more self-sufficient in terms of financing. We like to limit our use of bank financing to the extent we deem prudent.</p><h4>What does Lebanon have to offer as a place to do business?</h4><p>This country has an abundance of quality human capital and a tremendously resourceful and loyal diaspora. In order to survive and grow, the businesses that operate here have to serve their  resident and non-resident clients as well as the region, as it is a relatively small market to be confined to. As soon as a company grows to a certain size and develops a solid organization with the talent base to help it expand, it must grow beyond the country's borders.</p><h4>What projects does MENA Capital have in the pipeline?</h4><p>The one project that we are hoping to get started on soon is a residential gated community targeted at professionals, executives, and young families. Although we will continue to differentiate our projects in terms of design, quality, and amenities, the living spaces will be smaller and we will be emphasizing quality of life at more affordable prices.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the luxury apartments sector?</h4><p>I see the price remaining stable for the next year or so until demand matches supply. Land prices became more speculative in the past couple of years because of its scarcity, and they went up to the point where it became uneconomic to develop. This is why, slowly but surely, we are seeing a growing trend toward development in accessible areas around Beirut.</p><h4>How did you move into the food and beverages business as private equity specialists?</h4><p>When we started, we looked at what things we could do in private equity and found that most of the “hot" companies were technology-based or telecoms related, and were largely over priced, so we shied away from them. We then looked at where would be the next best area to move into, and found it to be food and beverages.</p><h4>How are you looking to expand in the restaurant business?</h4><p>The transaction that we have pursued thus far is a joint venture with Kabab-ji to develop the franchise in the US, starting in Washington, DC with a flagship outlet. Once we prove the concept and make sure that the operation is running smoothly and profitably, we will expand into more owned outlets, followed by franchising.</p><h4>What can you tell us about your support for small businesses in Lebanon?</h4><p>When I came back from the US in the late 1990s I realized there was a definite need to assist the under privileged youth of the country to build small businesses. Vast urbanization was seeing many move into the bigger cities or leave the country altogether. The idea, therefore, was to have those people create businesses that are needed in their local communities. Entrepreneurship is innate in Lebanon, but people need tools and capital. We have worked to provide them with the needed tools and helped them finance their startups. In recent years, we expanded the activities of the Entrepreneurial Development Foundation (EDF) into micro credits, extending the support from startups to the expansion of existing small businesses. In this regard, we have been supported by various businesses and foundations, both local and international, but mostly by local banks. Due to our extensive knowledge of the regions within the country, we can easily identify potential business startups and small businesses that are ripe for expansion. Through our network, we are now approached by banks to lend to small businesses. We are currently lending about LBP4 billion to LBP5 billion a year to between 900 and 1,000 small businesses around the country. Despite all the country's difficulties, we have experienced a high repayment record of almost 98%.</p><h4>What are the main challenges that are facing the market today?</h4><p>The poor political climate, coupled with the unsettled regional situation and global economic slowdown have slowed demand, especially for larger, high-end properties. However, given the growing flight away from financial assets and currencies that are losing their purchasing power, I foresee a return to strong demand for real estate in the not too distant future.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the size of DHL's operations in Lebanon?</h4><p>We have 122 employees and our turnover is over ‚¬20 million. A few years ago, for our express business, our market share was 55%, but we haven't done market share research since then. And I say express because a lot of express companies are involved in other things like freight and day-definite-type shipments. It is very hard to tell what is traditional airfreight and day-definite, and so when I am talking about market share it is pure express.</p><h4>Who are your typical clients?</h4><p>Our typical customer is anyone who wants a shipment from point A to point B within a specified time or specific number of days, with a specific transit time. Around 95% of our customers are corporate businesses, and they include pretty much any company you find in Lebanon, whether as an inbound or outbound customer. Other than that, around 5% is represented by the retail business and ad-hoc users that come in off the street.</p><h4>What is the demand for a domestic shipping network?</h4><p>It was growing up until a certain point. The straight “pick up a shipment and deliver it somewhere else in the world" part of the business was developing quite well. There is not a whole lot of distribution that goes on within Lebanon. One is we don't deal with domestic shipments. And two is there is not a great deal of domestic distribution in the way that DHL knows it. In Europe, the US, or Turkey you have big cities throughout a big country and you need a distribution network to get goods around. Lebanon is a one-city country, and so the room for local distribution is limited.</p><div class="quote">“Around 95% of our customers are corporate businesses, and they include pretty much any company you find in Lebanon."</div><h4>What are the needs for regional distribution and having Lebanon serve as a hub?</h4><p>There is something in that. We go through cycles where at one point in time it was developing quite well. We were involved in the Beirut Free Zone, where we had a small facility. We just upgraded that facility in 2010. However, the opportunities are few and far between and I think that has to do with stability in the area. To do distribution you need a company that is present internationally, or at least area wide, and say they want to set up and do distribution out of Lebanon. We had a few companies that do just that, and we market it very heavily. We sell Lebanon as an alternative to Dubai, and it is a real alternative: it is faster, it can be cheaper, it's organic, and you have local knowledge and local people. The problem is customers are reluctant to make the leap and set up shop in Lebanon.</p><h4>What expansion of facilities have you overseen?</h4><p>We have expanded our airport warehouse facilities, adding 2,500 sqm of bonded area. We have increased our number of service points, which are locations where the customer can drop off or pick up a shipment, and we have increased this number to nine. We increased the size of our warehouse at the port to 1,400 sqm. Our road network hasn't increased lately, but five years ago we set up a network that went into Lebanon, where today we have a truck for daily departure and daily arrival.</p><h4>What has an airside facility done for DHL's operations?</h4><p>DHL makes it a point to be close to or at an airport. It makes life a lot easier, and we have the volumes that justify such an investment. We have been in this airport facility for around 12 years, but five years prior to that we were planning and doing what we needed to get the approvals to set up. It is very hard to handle the kind of volumes we handle every day if you are not set up like this at an airport. If you take, for example, just the security screening, we have x-ray machines set up for outbound material and a scanner set up for inbound material. If you are not at the airport and you don't have the space, equipment, and capability to handle that, you end up not doing a very good job. You find you don't have the time it takes to do the proper checks. We have the luxury here in Lebanon of having our own gateway, where the shipments come in and go out. Our operations and our sales people are in one location. With everyone in one area it makes operations efficient and cost effective.</p><h4>What is your outlook for DHL and Lebanon in the future?</h4><p>We have always been positive about Lebanon and continue to be. We wouldn't have made significant investments if we didn't see a positive future. And so far 2011 has been good. We are seeing growth and customers are talking about investing again. What is important to know is how great Lebanon is as a distribution point. What the management have done at the port is positive and their future plans are spectacular. The traffic through that port has grown exponentially. There is a lot of transit traffic coming through here. Therefore, it wouldn't be very difficult for a company to base itself here and distribute here. The shipping lines are now coming direct from China and Europe. The turnaround time at the port is good and the proximity of Lebanon to markets like Syria, Jordan, Iraq, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia make it a prime shipment point. For DHL at least, that is something we sell quite heavily and something we believe in strongly and we have seen it at the free zone. We have signed customers and we know more and more are to come.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As Minister of Agriculture, what has been your vision to develop the sector?<br></h4><p>I have developed a strategy for the advancement of the agriculture sector with a program of action for 2010 to 2014. We are seeking to provide an appropriate institutional framework focusing on quality growth, while considering development issues that target human rights and living conditions.</p><h4>You have mentioned a trend of internal migration from rural areas to cities. What led to such a significant amount of the population migrating to Beirut?</h4><p>More than half the population of Lebanon lives in the Greater Beirut area. That means we have 50% of the population concentrated in 30% of the country's territory. The reason for this is the general framework of the economy, which in the past didn't provide a positive environment for the agriculture sector, with priority given to other sectors. This reduced the investment level in agriculture, and thus reduced the opportunities for development and competitiveness. The neglect of the agriculture sector in Lebanon resulted in poverty in rural areas and internal migration, which led to the emergence of poverty around cities and outward migration. What also led to a further influx of people in Beirut was the underdevelopment of the road system. Now we are completing an up-to-date road system to support areas outside of Beirut.</p><h4>What other development programs is the Ministry of Agriculture applying to reverse urban drift?</h4><p>Our investment plan includes measures to balance development between the regions, reduce poverty and malnutrition in rural areas, and strengthen the role of women and youth in rural development. As it is, 25% of the population relies on agriculture, and the population that works in the sector is of lower education. We are trying to encourage the youth to stay in rural areas so they can contribute to the development and preservation of the sector. This is not just a local focus, but an international focus.</p><div class="quote">“Our efforts are based on lowering the cost of production."</div><h4>How is the Ministry working to attract FDI?</h4><p>Our efforts are based on lowering the cost of production. Lebanon is a small country; therefore, one of the main costs imposed on companies is high land values. Secondly, energy costs in Lebanon are high. Thirdly, the cost of human resources is high. We are not trying to compare ourselves to countries in Europe, what we look at are the costs in the sector compared with our neighbors. If we experience a higher cost of production than Syria, Egypt, or Iraq then we will not be competitive in the marketplace. The way we can follow European countries is to subsidize agriculture. Additionally, the exclusion of customs costs can provide the needed support.</p><h4>The Ministry is looking to improve the contribution of agriculture to GDP. What are the main goals of the Ministry in accomplishing this?</h4><p>We are looking to achieve an increase in the agriculture sector from 5% to 8% of GDP. This increase will also be in line with the creation of 10,000-15,000 new jobs. Furthermore, we aim to decrease the trade imbalance of agricultural products that currently is at a ratio of 6:1 from imports to exports, where only 15% of the production in Lebanon is used for domestic consumption.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[The Lebanon Factor]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[the-lebanon-factor]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In 2010 you stated that your goal was to reform the tourism sector. What have been your major steps so far, and looking forward what are your biggest objectives toward that end?</h4><p>The most important thing is for the government to take tourism seriously. If you ask anyone, they'll tell you our most important sector is tourism. However, if you study the Lebanese public budget you'll see that the Ministry of Tourism gets less than 1% of the total. This does not make sense. We have to take tourism seriously not just in words; we have to put our money where our mouth is. We also need to think outside the box. Back in the 1960s when we started with the National Council for Tourism and after that the Ministry of Tourism, we created Law 58. This gave the Ministry the right to Build-Own-Transfer (BOT) projects and Public-Private-Partnerships (PPPs). No other country in the world was taking these steps at that time. We understood back then that tourism was important and the laws were designed specifically to allow the Ministry to take important steps without passing through the very complicated public sector processes. At this moment in time we do not have a vision, which is something I've been working on for the last two years. There are some fundamental questions I am asking. For example, why is it that we have only one airport? Why don't we see most of the low-cost flights coming here? Why is it that we don't have a center for meetings, incentives, conferences, and events (MICE) tourism? Why don't we have a major theme park? We are particularly well suited for that, and we could have a theme park manned by Lebanese people, unlike many of the theme parks in the region that are not staffed by locals but rather by cheap foreign labor. Why do we have only 40 tourism police rather than 240? When you cross our borders by land, why aren't there adequate facilities and service stations? Why don't we have resorts in Lebanon? Why does package tourism represent less than 3% of our tourism? Coming from Europe, why do British Midland Airways (BMI) and Middle East Airlines (MEA) have the exact same prices? We need to introduce more competition among airlines. Shopping, duty free and otherwise, has a better offering and better prices than many well-known shopping destinations in the region, so there is potential there. These are a few examples that speak to our potential strengths and reveal the type of reforms that I think are so important for the sector.</p><h4>What are your target markets, and where do you see untapped potential?</h4><p>We see a lot of untapped potential. We've addressed this by putting agencies in places like the ones we have in Germany and Britain. In Britain there are more than 100 Lebanese restaurants, and Lebanese food has become one of the top five or six cuisines, so interest in Lebanon and the potential to attract more British travelers is huge. The same is true for Spain and Russia. You have to also remember West Africa and Africa in general. There are hundreds of thousands of Lebanese living there, and we have good relations with those countries. Nigeria and Ghana are big markets for us with even more potential. The South American market, again due in large part to the Lebanese diaspora, also has great potential. More than 1.5 million Argentineans alone are of Lebanese origin. Of course, North America has a significant diaspora as well. The whole of the Americas has great potential. It is my hope that MEA and other airlines will start flying direct to the American continents.</p><h4>Global Blue just announced that tourism spending is up 8% in Lebanon during the first nine months of 2011. To what can we attribute this rise in tourism receipts despite a drop-off in arrivals?</h4><p>The decline in arrivals in 2011 is due to the problems in Syria. We have an average of 600,000 people arrive via land every year. Because you have to pass through Syria, this number dropped by half in 2011. We still managed to see an increase in tourism receipts, however, because we are emphasizing middle-income rather than lower-income groups. The average spending of a tourist in Lebanon is $4,000, which makes it one of the highest in the world, and this is very positive for us.</p><div class="quote">“The average spending of a tourist in Lebanon is $4,000, which makes it one of the highest in the world."</div><h4>What do you want people around the world to think of when they think of Lebanon?</h4><p>We want them to recognize that we are probably the most cosmopolitan country in the world. This is a country where you can walk into a pub and feel like you are in London. Walk in to a cafe and feel like you are in Paris, or even go to an Italian restaurant and feel like you are in Milan. And it is not just through the restaurants, but also through the people and their education. People grow up in this country speaking English, French, and Arabic. On top of this is the rich history of the country. You can visit churches here that are 2,000 years old. People forget how important this part of the world is for history and religions. Many aren't aware that the alphabet, even for Western languages, originated here. At the same time you can visit a very modern city. Finally, people should realize that when they are visiting Lebanon they are not just visiting this country, they are also visiting the Lebanese people, people who have invented a special joie de vivre.</p>]]></richbody0content>
