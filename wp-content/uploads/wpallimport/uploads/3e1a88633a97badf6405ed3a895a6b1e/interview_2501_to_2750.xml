		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been Westports' contribution to Malaysia's economic development?</h4><p>The contribution of Westports to Malaysia as a whole has been tremendous. Westports is one of the three mega-hub ports in the region, handling 9.5 million TEUs in 2018, and has connectivity to more than 350 ports globally. Before Westports was established, there was not a single hub port in Malaysia. Containers were shipped to Singapore to be connected or transshipped to the final destination from there. Westports commenced its conventional or non-container business in 1994 and two years later started its container operations. Growth has been phenomenal, transforming Westports not only into a regional hub but also the preferred port of calls among the shipping lines. As a mega-hub with extensive service coverage and connectivity, Westports has benefited industries across Malaysia.</p><h4>What have been the most important recent milestones for Westports?</h4><p>There are many contributing factors behind our growth and success. In addition to its prime location, Westports has invested in the latest facilities to accommodate the largest container vessels in the world. Productivity is critical. The speed with which we can turn around a vessel is imperative from our clients' perspective as less time spent at the port means more sailing time and for keeping to their sailing schedule. In April 2019, Westports broke a world record in terms of moves per hour, namely how quickly containers are being handled at a port. This has proven once again that Westports is one of the top ports in terms of productivity in the world, showcasing its capabilities, teamwork, and facilities to execute such an operation.</p><h4>What are your plans to expand container-handling capacity and reinforce the port's capabilities?</h4><p>Our current handling capacity is 14 million TEUs, which can potentially increase to 15 million in the short term by adding more ship-to-shore cranes. We have enough handling capacity buffer to accommodate future growth, as we handled 9.5 million TEUs in 2018. With regard to our long-term plan for expansion, we will build more capacity, and when all the container terminals are fully completed, our handling capacity will double to 28 million TEUs. We received the approval-in-principle for this future expansion plan from the government in 2018. We have appointed various consulting firms to conduct the technical studies as required and are now in the stage of finalizing these studies with the relevant authority.</p><h4>How do you assess the overall infrastructure in the Port Klang area?</h4><p>Port Klang is the 12th-largest port in the world in terms of container traffic, and we all would like to see ourselves break into the top 10. However, it will not be easy. We have to attract more cargo and services calling at our port, and we have to be supply driven in expanding our terminals. However, it is just not only about port facilities. It is equally critical that the necessary infrastructure is in place to support our expansion. We have been in talks with the government about building and widening the roads leading to Westports and Pulau Indah. We need the government to invest in infrastructure facilities to assist and act fast.</p><h4>What are the key catalysts for the growth of Malaysia's maritime industry?</h4><p>The key catalyst is the global economy. Another of the key catalysts for Port Klang in the last few years is that we have ample land for growth. This attracted many international and reputable companies to set up their regional distribution hubs here. The take-up rate for Port Klang Free Zone (PKFZ), located adjacent to Westports, has now reached more than 90% of its capacity. There is a 318-acre plot of land near the current PKFZ area, and this parcel of land has been earmarked and designated as PKFZ 2. This is a step in the right direction, as PKFZ 2 will be one of the key catalysts for the future growth of the maritime industry.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Islamic banking developed within the Maybank Group?</h4><p>In 1983, the Islamic Banking Act enabled the establishment of Malaysia's first Islamic bank. Maybank was founded in 1960 and started an Islamic window in 1993, offering Islamic products through the same channels as conventional products. In 2008, the vision of offering an alternative to conventional banking in Malaysia led to the establishment of Maybank Islamic. Over the last 10 years, we have grown from a fairly small operation to become a significant part of the group. In 2018, we contributed 59% to Maybank's financing in Malaysia. Maybank Islamic oversees around 30% of the group's assets and was responsible for 28% of the bank's profit before tax (PBT) in 2018. Islamic banking has significant room for growth in ASEAN countries such as Indonesia and Singapore. Since 2010, the Maybank Group has adopted an Islamic-first approach, where we offer customers sharia-compliant products and services as a standard product. If the product is fair and the pricing is competitive, it cuts across different faiths; half of our customer base is composed of non-Muslims. Our mission is to become a global leader in Islamic finance.</p><h4>How do you assess international awareness, understanding, and acceptance of Islamic finance?</h4><p>Understanding of Islamic finance has increased. The key thing is to explain the underlying principles behind some of the terminology and distill some of those transaction structures. We have additional filters such as how the proceeds from that financing facility will be used. We exclude a range of sectors, such as gaming, tobacco, and arms. Notably, in the sukuk space, close to 30 countries have issued sovereign sukuks, including the UK and China.</p><h4>Having pioneered its development, how can Malaysia continue to be at the forefront of innovation in the Islamic finance industry?</h4><p>Malaysia is the largest player in our region and the only non-GCC country in the top eight in terms of global banking assets. This gives us the opportunity to engage with stakeholders from different regions. There is a strong need for Islamic banking products to be more broadly accepted. The time has come for us to link the different countries and regions and synchronize their Islamic finance structures to move toward internationally recognized and accepted norms.</p><h4>How do you assess the impact of fintech on the banking industry in Malaysia?</h4><p>Fintech is an interesting development, though it is important to recognize that when one starts to deal with funds from clients, strict regulation will come into play. The fintech landscape has not reached the same regulatory robustness as the banking sector. The lion's share of the customer base still lies with banks, so it is logical for fintech companies to look for ways to work together with banks. At the same time, banks will increasingly look at models to embrace fintech.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>The momentum for Islamic banking to be on par with conventional banking is still there. It is important to ensure there is interaction and engagement with the halal economy, so that after taking an Islamic facility, other parts of the ecosystem are equally strong. Wealth management within the Islamic finance context also requires development, so these are the two main thrusts for Maybank Islamic. In addition, we are looking at the regional context. There is still a great deal to be done, and in the medium term we need to see a regulatory environment that would allow Islamic finance to be introduced at a much larger scale. The next logical step would be to link to the world's other Islamic finance center, the GCC, which we will do through our Dubai office. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What can you tell us about the merger that led to the creation of Arus? <br></strong>ARUS is the result of two very interesting organizations. On the one hand, Enlace Operativo came as an exercise in innovation in the area of labor risk management for Sura, whose chief aim was to facilitate data entry for payments and updates for companies' social security policies. On the other hand, Compuredes was born 35 years ago from a group of friends who decided to venture into the market of computer sales and network design. In 2016, both companies were merged into ARUS as a way to further spearhead innovation in our country. The merger allowed us to uncover a transformation path that has led us to consolidate our portfolio in order to provide our clients a truly revolutionary set of services. We take pride in making use of groundbreaking technology to propel our mission of supporting our clients in their digital transformation.</p><p><strong>ARUS ended 2018 with a revenue of COP250 billion (USD77.9 million). How did it achieve this? <br></strong>Our main focus was to include cutting edge products in our service portfolio. Partnerships with established providers in cloud computing, machine learning, and robotic process automation also resulted in more than USD3 million in investments to update our existing services, which played an enormous part in our success. Additionally, we solidified our philosophy as a tech company that centers itself on the client experience with our services. We have focused on achieving this through partners and collaborators that share our commitment to speeding up transformation. When it comes to our PILA services (online transactional social security services), we have migrated to a digital experience for our clients. Understanding that Colombian labor has evolved and the independent worker has become more prevalent, we have committed to making payment tools more accessible and simple than ever before.</p><p><strong>ARUS' broad service portfolio includes tech solutions and ITO-BPO services. What role do your different lines of business play in your firm's overall portfolio?</strong><br>ARUS has four major lines to our portfolio, the first of which is outsourcing corporate tech solutions featuring data center management, network, and equipment implementations. Through these services we have aided our clients in managing their tech infrastructures so they can shift their focus on their business strategy. Our second focus is outsourcing digital documentation. Instead we have transformed paper-based data entry services into digital documentation. As a third focus, we have a cutting-edge portfolio in RPA, cloud computing, and analysis, thus growing and developing the portion of our portfolio and spurring innovation in all our existing lines. Our last but certainly not least line is our participation in social security payments through the PILA platform. </p><p><strong>ARUS has also developed technological solutions to facilitate social security payments for self-employed workers. How do you do this? </strong><br>ARUS is one of the pioneers of PILA, an integrated payment platform for social security. Before PILA, companies and independent businesses would submit handwritten reports on a monthly basis. PILA has led to the automation of this system, allowing for real-time updated information, giving all Colombian employees access to social security services immediately after payment. Administrators are authenticated in this system, which guarantees there is no fraud or mismatch of payments. Furthermore, PILA gives detailed information to beneficiaries of the employee that gives support and peace of mind to their families.</p><p><strong>What kind of firms form your client portfolio? <br></strong>ARUS has a presence in all the main cities in the country (the north coast, the west, Antioquia, and Bogotá), where we have established ourselves with high quality corporate services and always prioritize our clients' needs. We are also focusing on medium-sized corporations, where we can provide them with the tools necessary to nurture their tremendous potential to unlock new niches in their respective markets. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How would you describe the presence of Asesoftware in Colombia, and what is its importance in the sector?<br></strong>Asesoftware is a software development company with 29 years of experience in the market. Our main business lines are the development and maintenance of software and IT outsourcing, which represent 80% of the company's income. Our other business lines include analytics that turn data into actionable information, the organization's main strategic asset, and IT cloud services in which we focus on providing cloud infrastructure maintenance and monitoring services. We have dedicated ourselves to improving these services over the years to give them a worldwide dimension through internationally recognized frameworks and methodologies. Our certifications include CMMI DEV/5, which is a maturity framework in software engineering, and CMMI SVC/3, which seeks to fine-tune excellent practices in IT services. Some of our clients are the major players in the financial and insurance sectors, such as Banco de la Republica, Fiduprevisora, Scotiabank, Banco Davivienda, Seguros Bolivar, and the Colombian government.</p><p><strong>How has your software evolved to work with your customers in this new digital world?<br></strong>Banking is immersed in digitalization. However, the most disruptive aspect is the appearance of new business models. The banking sector is betting on new models with technology such as blockchain and other big data technologies. The banks are investing significantly in big data and AI and looking to compete with these new digital models, which generate business opportunities for software companies. On the other hand, the insurance sector is more conservative, but also has a great deal of technological movement, and is putting together several digital banking departments, which involves a great deal of software development. </p><p><strong>What is the advantage for an international company such as Scotiabank having a local partner such as Asesoftware?<br></strong>We know the local market, which has its peculiarities. One must know the legislation and regulations. Our added value is that we have in-depth knowledge of banking and know about the latest technologies that, for example, use Classpath. We have helped people maintain their systems for years. Understanding the business is the most difficult thing during software development, but this process can be more fluid with a local partner. We have spent a great deal of time looking at new technologies and issues of agile software development. The latter must include a design part of the customer experience, which is why we have sought to unite the world of design and software development to offer development equipment where these are intertwined. We adapt rapidly to external methodologies that seek agility in development while always considering the customer's experience. Before, software development was extremely technical and did not consider the user experience. Now the user experience is extremely important, especially in the digital world. In the case of Scotiabank in Colombia, we have offered our expertise in business and software development with agility and customer experience.</p><p><strong>What can you tell us about your Seed Plan, and how does Asesoftware promote Colombian talent in the technology industry?<br></strong>The Seed Plan emerged 10 years ago and sought to encourage job growth, not only from an altruistic perspective but also a business one in the field of systems. The need for talent in that area is impressive. The latest studies say there is a deficit of 60,000 people in the field of software development in Colombia; we have 500 people. In this program, we accept electronic engineers, mechatronics engineers, mathematicians, and physicists. A team of 15 people enters the Seed Plan, where they receive training to access the labor market in the following four months. We teach them the industrial techniques of software engineering and provide training in project management, quality, design, and analysis. Electronic engineers are excellent software designers. The objectives of the plan are to nurture the flow of personnel that we need and encourage entry employment.<span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is the extent of Teleperformance's operations in Colombia and the reasons behind its remarkable growth in the last few years?</strong><br>Teleperformance focuses on handling all of a company's interactions. Our mantra is “every interaction matters," regardless of whether it is a digital, online chat, or face-to-face interaction. Our focus is on the experience of our clients, who are the customers of the biggest brands in the world. The reason Teleperformance has been a success story and continues to grow is that in our industry, Colombia has a great balance of young people and a high literacy rate. We can offer that talent to the world. This is why we have had excellent results. Our young talent really wants to help these brands offer amazing things to the world, and our customers notice this.</p><p><strong>Can you elaborate on Teleperformance's commitment to the growth and development of human capital in Colombia?<br></strong>We will close 2018 with 16,000 families that we have to take care of. Different segments of our business require different employee profiles and requirements. For example, the finance sector is heavily regulated, and we have to be compliant with numerous regulations and undergo many audits. Finance requires a specific employee profile along with specific training so that the staff understands its responsibilities. We also have to demonstrate that we comply with global financial regulations. When one works for businesses as diverse as airlines, medical providers, IT companies, and global telco brands, it has to engage with different cultures, similar to companies in the same industry but from different countries. Employees have to develop the soft skills to understand, for example, how people from different cultures behave and express their feelings, and the requirements vary from industry to industry. Employees need detailed knowledge and technical language skills, along with a caring approach when dealing with medical inquiries. They need a different set of skills as compared to providing a customer with a code to fix their computer.</p><p><strong>What is the importance of Colombia in Teleperformance's portfolio in both a regional and global context?<br></strong>Teleperformance Colombia is in the top five companies for the group; however, there are various company profiles within the group. For example, certain Teleperformance companies operate in countries that are so large that their market has a role by itself. Other Teleperformance companies like us are based on exports. We are the export hub for our region, and there are other hubs around the world for other regions.</p><p><strong>What expansion plans does Teleperformance have for Colombia?<br></strong>We will open in another city in Colombia. For almost a year, we have been analyzing everything, including location, population, connectivity, suppliers, legislation, and tax. The beauty of Colombia is that it has many mid-sized cities, and there are many locations to choose from.</p><p><strong>What role does technology and innovation play in Teleperformance's approach to serving its clients?<br></strong>As with every industry, digitalization is ongoing both for our clients and Teleperformance. It is a survival requirement, and we have been working to understand the context, and, therefore, the capabilities we need to develop for the future. Now, we have many analytics and RPAs, and today we are both a customer service and a technology company. There are many contexts now where if one does not have the technological skills and an understanding of how to develop its strategy in that market, its business will not prevail over time. We are doing a great deal on this, for example with social media, which is important to the big brands of the world. Today, they also have to be compliant with numerous regulations and take a great deal of responsibility for developments in the digital world. This is a big opportunity for us. I see the world and the company changing, though it is also a major opportunity for the market to continue developing. There is a growing middle class globally that demands services, and just putting Colombia on the global technology map will give us work for the rest of our lives. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess the significance of BMW Malaysia for the group's global operations?</h4><p>BMW started operations in Malaysia in 2003, and a great deal has happened in these 16 years. People tend to think we just sell cars and provide maintenance services together with our dealers; however, we have developed significantly. A great example is our parts distribution center in Johor Bahru, where we cater to 23 countries in Asia Pacific with original spare parts. We have also started cooperating with Sime Darby Auto Engineering (SDAE) in Kulim Hi-Tech Park to assemble cars locally. Together, we unveiled a new engine assembly facility in 2018 where we assemble three- and four-cylinder engines. For over a decade now, we have been running a regional training center that caters to more than 20 countries in Asia Pacific and beyond, as we have people coming from the US and Canada for special trainings that are only available in English in Munich or Kuala Lumpur. In the same building, we have a group data center as well. BMW Group Malaysia also oversees a financial services entity that was launched in 2007 to provide financing to both our dealers and customers. Together with our dealer network, which has grown significantly since BMW established itself in Malaysia, BMW Group Malaysia now comprises 24 entities in the country. As such, there is a greater significance than just selling cars. Truly, BMW Group Malaysia has developed into a hub in Asia Pacific for BMW Group.</p><h4>How do you assess your current share of the market in Malaysia?</h4><p>BMW Group Malaysia is the fastest-growing premium manufacturer in the country, and it will continue to be. We are confident about the new products we will be introducing in 2019, which will capitalize on our strong market momentum and customer centric dealer network. They are reliable partners who are constantly working to improve in every facet of their business. The BMW Group is in the middle of its largest product model offensive, so people can expect more exciting models from us. Additionally, we are always looking for opportunities to strengthen our position in Malaysia. As an innovation-based company, we make a great partner for the Malaysian government, which is seeking partners and organizations that can help drive its agenda on innovation. We can meaningfully contribute in this respect and seek to establish an even stronger working partnership with the government.</p><h4>What are the particular characteristics of the Malaysian market for BMW Group?</h4><p>The market was volatile in 2018 with the general elections, which left a rather substantial impact on our sales figures. Aside from this one-off occurrence, Malaysia is characterized by tremendous growth, which is also reflected in the forecasts for the performance of the national economy. In 2H2018, Malaysia was the best-performing market in Asia Pacific for the BMW Group, with BMW's engine assembly contributing to its growth in the region. Hence, we are confident in the future. One particular characteristic of the local consumer market is that the premium segment of the market differs substantially from others when it comes to the drivetrains we offer. Almost 60% of our deliveries in Malaysia come from plug-in hybrid vehicles, the highest record in the world for the BMW Group.</p><h4>How do you assess the sensitivity of Malaysian consumers to innovation and new models?</h4><p>The local consumer market is open to innovative technology and new things in general. Social media applications are highly utilized here, and we have been successful with every launch that involved truly innovative elements. We were successful with plug-in hybrid vehicles and most recently with the BMW i8 Roadster—all of which drew tremendous social media response. Our next goal is to bring in electric cars to Malaysia, which could happen as early as this year. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[calculated-approach]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess Cagamas' performance in 2018, and what have been the company's main accomplishments? </h4><p>In 2018, Cagamas' business strengthened because the company continues to provide liquidity and support to local financial institutions via competitive cost of funding raised from a diversified pool of investors. 2018 was another successful year, as the total assets purchased amounted to MYR12.1 billion and total issuances jumped to MYR15.8 billion, the highest since 2008, with 22 new Cagamas debt securities and five new Cagamas foreign currency issuance exercises. Issuances raised from the domestic market amounted to MYR14.62 billion and MYR1.13 billion was raised from our multi-currency programs established in 2014. In July 2018, Cagamas' tenacity to engage with investors resulted in the inaugural issuance of US dollar floating rate notes (FRNs). The issuance also represented the company's second FRN. The first FRN was in the Australian dollar, issued in October 2017. We have also issued similar financial products for Hong Kong dollars. The Bond Pricing Agency Malaysia (BPAM) during its annual BPAM Bond Market Awards presented Cagamas with the award for Top Issuance-All and Top Traded Amount-Conventional categories for 2018.</p><h4>How does Cagamas promote affordable housing? </h4><p>Cagamas continues to play a role in government-initiated housing programs. In promoting homeownership, Cagamas' role is providing competitive, long-term, and ready financing for mortgages. Cagamas is actively involved in the My First Home Scheme and the Youth Housing Scheme introduced by the government. These affordable housing schemes provide support and financing options to eligible Malaysians to own their first homes. For both schemes, our sister company, Cagamas SRP Bhd, acts as the guarantor with the banks on financing above the 90% level. SRP has recently allowed first-time home buyers who are self-employed and with monthly household income of MYR5,000 and below to purchase their first home priced up to MYR300,000. As of December 2018, Cagamas had provided guarantee for housing loans totaling MYR3.7 billion, enabling about 18,000 individuals and households to own their first homes. Innovative schemes such as shared equity funding, Rent-to-Own, and alternative funding options will enable targeted borrowers to be more 'bankable' when purchasing their first homes. In addition, this will enable socially responsible or green investors to include these products in their portfolio, broadening Cagamas' pool of investors.</p><h4>Are you planning to further strengthen your Islamic finance offering? </h4><p>Being the largest issuer of debt instruments in the Malaysian capital market, we have contributed to the strengthening of Malaysia's position as a global Islamic finance hub. Cagamas' Islamic finance offering will continue to progress alongside the conventional offering. In term of sukuk issuances, Cagamas will continue to issue bonds to meet growing domestic demand as well as create international awareness and acceptance of sukuk. The existing MTN program is being upsized and will see additional features to the existing sukuk offerings. Cagamas is also working to add additional sukuk structures to the existing EMTN program to tap the international market. In line with Bank Negara Malaysia's guidelines for a value-based intermediation (VBI) initiative, the company is embarking on purchasing loans and financing related to environmental and social impact projects, in addition to piloting the issuance of sustainability bonds and sukuk to fund these initiatives and mortgage REITS. With VBI, Cagamas aims to deliver the intended outcomes of shariah through practices, conduct, and offerings that generate positive and sustainable impact for the economy, community, and environment, consistent with the shareholders' sustainable returns and long-term interests. Through this initiative, Cagamas will be able to broaden its investor pool to include socially responsible or green investors that would help open the market further. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main accomplishments and milestones of KIB over the past year?</h4><p>As a firm, we have grown in line with our objectives over the past two years. We have tried to ensure that we can serve multiple segments of the market, and have therefore built a mass retail, institutional, and a high-net-worth individual arm. We are seeing particular growth opportunity among high-net-worth and ultra-high-net-worth individuals. At the product level, we have moved beyond mere asset management and are now licensed to distribute multiple funds and work with over 20 partners. In early 2018, we were granted a financial planning license by regulators and are now able to offer a full financial planning platform. We are one of the few players in Malaysia with multi-segment and multi-distributional activities. Furthermore, we are proud of our efforts to promote sustainable investment; we officially became a signatory of the Malaysian Institutional Code of Investors in 2017. We are also the first asset manager in Malaysia to be rated by a credit agency. It is vital for us to focus on sustainability and transparency especially with the growing interest in ASEAN and Islamic finance. We have also worked to expand our strategic alliances through which we can leverage the expertise of other firms and vice versa. Together with our partners in the US and Australia, we launched Malaysia's first AI-based hedge fund, and an Australian income fund in the market, respectively. We are also currently working with the biggest ETF issuer in Taiwan to launch our first leveraged and inverse ETF in Malaysia in 2019. Moving forward, we will continue to build cross-border partnerships.</p><h4>How has fintech impacted the asset management industry in Malaysia, and how is KIB addressing it?</h4><p>There are two elements to look at in this area: the financial part and the tech part. In terms of technology, there have been some strong developments, and asset managers must embrace and deploy new technologies. One way in which new technologies help us is by creating a more interactive experience for clients. In the back office, we are focused on making our processes more efficient through the application of technology. It is also helpful in terms of compliance and regulatory requirements, risk management, and facilitating better investment decisions. Asset managers have to start looking at AI and big data analytics closely. Regarding the financial side of fintech, Malaysian regulators have been quite progressive in their efforts. Two years ago, the regulators launched a digital investment management license. This allowed clients to get their investments information online. We are looking at this too, and it will be an important method for targeting the Millennial generation. We foresee a hybrid model becoming especially popular, with robots and humans working hand-in-hand. At the firm level, we are undergoing this transformation, and are in the midst of a two-year IT transformation plan that extends across our entire business. </p><h4>Are you seeing growing appetite for investment in Malaysia among international investors?</h4><p>Not yet, but I believe that more and more investors will return to Malaysia. We are trading at fair valuations. Malaysia is moving toward political maturity, which is a positive sign. Over time, we will see changes that lead to more transparency and less corruption. This is a part of the value chain that we are developing within Malaysia, and it promises many positive spillover effects in terms of FDI and development. Properties and stocks are priced attractively, making Malaysia an excellent country in which to reap the opportunities. Highly attuned investors from Europe have a keen interest in Malaysia, and investors should recognize that this is an excellent time for a closer look. KIB is the one-stop gateway to Malaysia, and we offer a variety of services to investors looking at the country. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[A bigger reach]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[a-bigger-reach]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is the story of Central Cervecera de Colombia?<br></strong>We are in an industry that has been very stable for many years. Central Cervecera de Colombia was a fresh investment that went into a sector that was run by only one big player for decades. The company is a joint venture between CCU from Chile and Postobón from Colombia, which made an investment of more than USD400 million to create Central Cervecera. Every stockholder has been supportive of our development in Colombia. In the case of CCU, which had a long presence in the Chilean market, it has been expanding and developing its capabilities in international markets since the 1990s. Therefore, Colombia is an important expansion, as it could be one of its top-15 beer markets globally. CCU brings its expertise in the production of beer and experience in how to compete in the international beer market. On the distribution and commercial side, Postobón has been a strategic player in the development of the local market with successful activities and results. Overall, our objective is to dynamize the beer industry in Colombia. During our five years of operation we have been developing capabilities in the commercial space and developing brands. We have also built a manufacturing capacity. It is important to have a local production in this industry due to the market structure. We have been performing well, increasing our understanding of the industry. We have also developed effective strategies to reach more consumers as well as move forward in this industry. Colombian consumers, particularly in certain areas of the country, are open to seeing more brands. The market has been growing, especially in the premium market for brands such as Heineken and Sol. For decades, Colombians did not have the opportunity to try new, international brands. A good thing about Central Cervecera is that it provides consumers in small towns the possibility to try new brands that previously were only available in main supermarkets in major cities.</p><p><strong>What makes Andina different, and how were you able to break the monopoly?<br></strong>Andina was born from a beautiful idea that is well aligned with the future of Colombia. Colombia is a country of regions, and there are different aspects that make it special. This diversity makes us special. We define Andina as Colombia in a beer; the aim behind it is to integrate all of the diversity within the country. That is happening in the beer industry, where there is a beer for the Paisas, the center of the country, and one for those on the Atlantic coast. We think this diversity multiplies. People see Andina reflecting that in the flavor profile. Moreover, in Carlos Vives, we have an outstanding ambassador for the brand. He works with our roots, sounds, and the way different regions behave. Together, we created a masterpiece, Dejame Quererte, where we collected all the rhythms of Colombia and combined them into a single song to showcase our diversity.</p><p><strong>How is Central Cervecera working to promote responsible consumption in Colombia?<br></strong>We have different approaches. First, we are following global platforms for responsible consumption. A percentage of our investment in Heineken goes to educating consumers about enjoying beer responsibly. We also have a “Don't Drink and Drive“ campaign, which is global. Also, the company has specific corporate programs. For example, we have a program with the young people in the local community and via commercial outlets to educate people on how to consume alcohol in a responsible way. This is the beginning, as we are in the process of expanding the reach and scope of our program. </p>]]></richbody0content>

Since then, we have evolved and adapted to the changing economic landscape in order to remain relevant, which has resulted in the RHB we know today. From a business point of view, we have also been supporting the broad base of economic sectors in Malaysia. In the early 20th century, we financed tin mining operations in the country, and while these have ceased to exist, we have exposure to all of the key sectors that form Malaysia's economy.</p><h4>Could you elaborate on the vision behind FIT22 and its main objectives?</h4><p>In January 2018, RHB launched its five-year strategic roadmap known as FIT22. Comprised of 22 initiatives, FIT22 is designed to achieve our 2022 aspiration, which is to be among the top-three banks in Malaysia in terms of performance. Anchored on three strategic themes, first we want to strengthen Malaysia as our core, focusing on selected segments, as 90% of our income still comes from Malaysia. Second, we will be strategic in where we compete overseas. RHB has presence in nine ASEAN countries as well as in Hong Kong. In many of these countries, we will spend our limited resources wisely to compete in selected business areas. Third, we need to think about innovation and people's readiness to meet skills of the future. FIT stands for Funding the Group's journey, Investing in technological and digital initiatives with a medium-term horizon, and Transforming the organization by building a winning operating model that prioritizes customer journeys, internal agility, and digital enablement. FIT22 is an umbrella for the 22 key initiatives that are targeted to propel RHB to be a leading financial services player.</p><h4>How do you assess the impact of fintech on the banking industry in Malaysia?</h4><p>Fintech has emerged from the need to meet what the customer wants. In a way, RHB is a fintech and we also partner with fintech companies that can add value to our offerings. We have partnerships with several fintech companies, such as Funding Societies, a P2P platform through which SMEs in Malaysia can obtain small loans. We have also partnered with RinggitPlus for aggregation of personal finance. We will continue to invest in latest tech, though fintech will be driven by customers.</p><h4>How do you plan to further develop RHB's operations across the ASEAN markets?</h4><p>In some ASEAN markets, we offer commercial banking, investment banking, securities, and asset management products and services. Singapore and Thailand are examples of markets where we are able to provide a holistic value proposition. In Indonesia, we are only involved in securities and asset management as we do not have the retail reach, and therefore we have to be more reliant on digital brokering. The key is to identify where we can fight and where our capital can generate the right return.</p><h4>How do you assess the 2019 budget in light of the need of regaining investor and consumer confidence?</h4><p>The budget is seen in a longer timeframe context as it is about resetting the fundamentals. The three anchors are reducing Malaysia's high debt level, enhancing private-sector participation, and addressing the bottom 40% of households. In 2019, the fiscal deficit will be higher but the government is committed to reducing it. Notably, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Housing has launched the MYR1-billion (USD240 million) Affordable Housing Fund, and through this scheme, RHB and four other lenders will extend credit to first-time home buyers. Malaysia's fundamentals remain strong, as reflected by continued current account surplus, commendable foreign exchange reserves, and low unemployment rate. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main recent highlights and achievements of MDBC?</h4><p>In 2018, MDBC won the APAC 2018 International Chambers of Commerce Membership Engagement Program of the Year Awards. In 2019, we were recognized as one of the top Dutch chambers in the world, being only the second to receive the NLinBusiness quality mark at an accreditation ceremony held in the presence of the Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs, HE Stef Blok. We surpassed the milestone of 1,000 placed students for our Student Internship Program (SIP) in 2018 and continue to grow the program. Equally important, we continue to see a growth in memberships from 40 in 2003 to nearly 300 in 2019.</p><h4>What is the scope of services you provide to your members?</h4><p>MDBC provides business services, representation, and networking for all members and businesses with Malaysian-Dutch links. Oftentimes, Dutch entrepreneurs looking to enter the Malaysian market will approach us. We guide them in the set-up process and put them in touch with the necessary local authorities and our members who provide a wide variety of services—everything from corporate secretariat, flexible work spaces, and relocation services to branding and logistics support, to name just a few. We also directly offer visa services, career services, and provide our member companies with Dutch student interns through our SIP program to help them with special projects. Additionally, as Malaysia's is a relationship-based business environment, we help them establish these relationships at the frequent informative and networking events that we organize. MDBC is recognized as one of the most active business councils in Malaysia, so there is ample opportunity for networking. With chapters in Penang and Johor, we are able to provide these services and networking opportunities even for organizations located in the northern and southern regions of the country. With our fellow, bilateral chambers, MDBC also does lobbying for our members as and when issues arise in the business community. With a collective presence, we can more effectively bring the issues and concerns of the Malaysian-Dutch business community to the Malaysian government, often resulting in a quicker resolution.</p><h4>How do you assess the importance of the ASEAN region, and in particular Malaysia, for the Netherlands?</h4><p>ASEAN and Malaysia are growing in importance to the Netherlands. The Netherlands' Ministry of Economic Affairs has now placed ASEAN-5 (Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam) in second spot, only behind China, in its ranking of priority countries and regions. With a combined GDP of USD2.63 trillion and a fast-growing market of over 630 million consumers, the ASEAN market is a dynamic one. It provides interesting business opportunities for Dutch companies in a wide variety of areas. Within that, Malaysia is a significant market for the Netherlands. In 2018, trade between the Netherlands and Malaysia amounted to a total of EUR7.87 billion. Dutch investments in Malaysia increased with impressive numbers in 2018. Malaysia remains an important market for Dutch machinery and transport equipment, food products and live animals, and meat and meat preparations. Malaysia remains the second-largest trading partner of the Netherlands within ASEAN, leaving only Singapore ahead as the regional transshipment hub.</p><h4>How do you assess the ease of doing business in Malaysia for Dutch investors?</h4><p>Dutch investors benefit from the access that Malaysia provides to a much wider region, and there are similarities between the Netherlands' role in the EU and Malaysia's role in ASEAN. These past 10-15 years, significant improvements have been made in the ease of doing business in Malaysia, and the country has the rankings to prove it. Organizations such as MIDA, MDEC, and TalentCorp, together with the various state investment agencies and economic corridors, have all provided substantial support to foreign investors. As chambers, we have emphasized to the new government the importance of consistency in matters that effect trade and investments; certain laws and guidelines have to be maintained, or for any proposed changes there should first be a dialogue with the corporate sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess BMCC's contribution to supporting the British business community in Malaysia?</h4><p><span></span><strong>ANDREW SILL</strong> BMCC has been part of the Malaysian economy for 56 years. During that time, the chamber has evolved and developed to ensure it remains relevant to both economies and its members. Currently, we have 270 members, and two-thirds of them are SMEs. We provide connectivity and work closely with the Department for International Trade of the UK government in terms of promoting investments. We provide research analysis of the Malaysian market and economy and identify potential B2B partnerships. We also run signature events, such as our big annual Christmas luncheon.</p><h4>What is the philosophy behind BMCC's Business Excellence Awards, and how does it foster the development of SMEs?</h4><p><span></span><strong>JENNIFER LOPEZ</strong> One of our biggest recent accomplishments was the launch of the Business Excellence Awards. The driving objective behind establishing the awards was to create an appropriate opportunity to profile and acknowledge the significant investment links between the two countries. In 2018, we received an amazing response, with over 400 attendees including two ministers, and tremendous media coverage. The BMCC acknowledges the Malaysian government's emphasis on SMEs as the growth engine of the economy going forward. We aim to support SMEs by providing more competitive playing fields and avenues for expansion.</p><h4>What is the idea behind the recent establishment of various sector committees?</h4><p><span></span><strong>AS</strong> We sought to provide a forum for our members to share knowledge, insights, and concerns about their industry. The most logical sector to start with was the energy sector, given the heavy role of oil and gas in Malaysia's economy. We received great support from the British High Commission and enthusiastic feedback from both our members and external companies that were pleased to be a part of it. There is engagement with the relevant ministries and large domestic players, which has contributed to the success, and we have built on that quickly by looking at other sectors. Education came up as a logical choice; around 35,000 Malaysian students are studying in the UK, and in recent years a number of British institutions have established operations in Malaysia. Four commissions have been established so far for advocacy, energy, education, and technology. The education commission will be split into a higher education and secondary education commission, as the issues they face are fairly different.</p><h4>What is the scope of services you provide to your members?</h4><p><span></span><strong>JL</strong> We provide four pillars of services. The first is the B2B element, which includes our social, commercial, and business focus events and our powerful network. Second, we increasingly focus on the business to government aspect. Through our sector committees and advocacy working group s, we identify issues and bring them forward to policymakers. Number three includes the trade services supporting British trade and investment into Malaysia. We are increasingly looking at supporting our Malaysian members that seek to make investments in the UK. We work closely with the British High Commission and Department for International Trade.</p><p><span></span>How do you assess the ease of doing business in Malaysia for UK investors, and where do you see investment opportunities going forward?</p><p><span></span><strong>AS</strong> Malaysia is one of the more open economies and embraces FDI. Generally, the economic environment and incentives provided by the government are fairly impressive, which is reflected in the interest from British companies. The electrical and electronics industry has been and will remain extremely important to the economy, and the halal industry and automotive innovation are emerging strongly. Another opportunity lies in infrastructure development, which will provide opportunities for the construction and services industries. One thing that underpins all the sectors is digitalization and Industry 4.0. This is where British companies have the strength to offer their professional services. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[30 Million Tourists by 2030]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[bill-ernest-ceo-saudi-entertainment-ventures-seven]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>SEVEN was incepted as the latest PIF venture into the entertainment sphere, focused on the establishment of entertainment centers around the Kingdom. Could you tell us more about the mandate of SEVEN, and what we may expect in the coming years?€¨</h4><p>SEVEN has the mission to develop, invest in and operate a number of family-friendly entertainment destinations and attractions in Saudi Arabia. We are the leading arm of the Kingdom's plan to invest USD64 billion to build an entertainment ecosystem right here in Saudi Arabia. It has been widely quoted that Saudi Arabia will attract nearly 30 million visitors a year by 2030, a figure we are working steadily towards. Our aim is to bring visitors to Saudi Arabia, of course, but also provide meaningful entertainment—and gainful employment—options for the people of the Kingdom. Our vision is to become the leading national investor, developer and operator of a diverse entertainment ecosystem in Saudi Arabia. We are working to support and develop the entertainment sector, build capacity and strengthen local talent by establishing a myriad of thoughtful and creative recreational projects across the country. Our vision is four-fold: launching movie theaters, recreational complexes, amusement parks and family entertainment centers. In the coming years, you can expect to witness a sea-change in Saudi Arabia's entertainment sector. We will see a large influx of new visitors, keen to enjoy ground-breaking world-class leisure facilities and entertainment options like the world has never seen before.</p><h4>Saudi Arabia is relatively unknown as a tourist destination — aside from religious visitors for pilgrimage purposes. How does the SEVEN fit into the master plan to attract more foreign visitors into the Kingdom? €¨</h4><p>Our mandate is closely aligned with Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030, and we are the investment arm of the Public Investment Fund (PIF), the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund. SEVEN, as the driving force in the Kingdom's new entertainment era, is charged with implementing the vision, which includes creating a destination worthy of attracting international visitors. Attracting more tourists—and tourist dollars—to the Kingdom centers around developing a world-class entertainment ecosystem. We are lucky in many ways to start with greenfield sites, and no legacy issues. We are also fortunate to have the blessing and backing of the Saudi government and authorities in building the infrastructure. In line with Saudi culture and tradition, our focus from the outset has been on family-friendly entertainment. From providing the very latest high-tech entertainment such as VR and AI-based gaming and events, to exploring the best of the country's natural wonders, Saudi Arabia presents an untapped mine of exciting new tourism opportunities, in a world where people are always craving something new. The Ministry of Culture has stated goals of facilitating greater foreign tourism to the Kingdom, which will of course assist us in our goal.</p><h4>In recent years, the public ecosystem around culture, entertainment, sports and heritage has been expanded. What synergies do you strive for with the other entities? €¨</h4><p>SEVEN is part of the national drive towards a new economy, less dependent on fossil fuel revenues, so we are obviously working very closely with all the relevant government entities and stakeholders. A very visible commitment from the highest echelons of society underlines the importance of the move towards a more diversified economy. Under the auspices of PIF and the government's overarching Vision 2030, we are all working very closely on every aspect of building a new entertainment ecosystem. We are excited to see projects like NEOM, Qiddiya, and the Red Sea Project begin, and we will share knowledge and experiences as we all work together for a bright new future. The creation of this sector involves global business deals, new visa rules, infrastructure, technology, architecture and design, all paying heed to local culture and heritage.</p><h4>What are the opportunities for the private sector—in hospitality, entertainment, F&amp;B, leisure, construction—to get involved in SEVEN projects? </h4><p>As mentioned above, the entertainment ecosystem encompasses so many different aspects. Opportunities for the private sector are many and varied. We are a Saudi Arabian company working for the wider, long-term benefit of the nation, and so looking to engage with the best companies across the Kingdom. From customer-facing staff to experts in every field, we need partners, joint ventures, contractors and stakeholders who are proud, committed and energized to join us in our journey of creating a whole new industry. While we are searching for partners globally, our quest begins on our own doorstep, with an urgent need for world-class local private sector entities to become involved in helping achieve the exciting goals underlined by the Vision 2030 blueprint. The sector's biggest challenge is ensuring we find, encourage and train the Kingdom's brightest, most ambitious people in a whole new set of skills suitable for this sector. SEVEN aims to link up with existing education and vocational training providers across the Kingdom to provide appropriate new courses and training for the new career paths we are opening up. We expect to attract people of all ages and skill levels, but youth are clearly key in ensuring the future success of the sector. We will make training, secondment and on-site learning a key part of the SEVEN success story. We expect Saudi Arabia's educational establishments to offer more courses at undergraduate and graduate level in fields such as design, art, computing, hospitality, leisure, sports science, catering, marketing, advertising, and PR. This is a project firmly for Saudis, and it needs to be managed, run and overseen by Saudis from the outset. Simply put, the offsets will be clear, strong economic growth as the Kingdom moves away from reliance on its traditional revenue sources of energy. With a vast uptick in the number of visitors, every aspect of society will benefit — from direct tourism services to indirect advantages of government utilizing increased tourism revenues on social welfare, for example.</p><h4>What are your primary ambitions for the year ahead?</h4><p>Our plan is ambitious, rapid, and breathtaking. It's unlike anything ever seen anywhere else in the world. When we launched in 2017, it was announced that our owners, the Public Investment Fund, expect the company's projects to serve more than 50 million visitors, provide more than 22,000 direct jobs and contribute to the GDP by approximately SAR8 billion by 2030. On launch in 2017, it is on record that we had initial capital of SAR10bn (USD2.7bn) to invest in nationwide projects. The 2019-2020 financial year will see the rapid rollout of more family-friendly cinemas across the Kingdom. We plan to open several movie theaters this year alone. Our plans are ambitious, but teaming up with AMC Group—the largest movie theater company in the world— makes it simpler to emulate their world-leading experience across the Kingdom. We have scheduled up to 50 movie theaters, that's 450 screens, to be open by 2022. Our schedule is to open up to 20 entertainment destinations before 2030. We have already made announcements regarding our plans for the Riyadh entertainment complex and revealed plans for the Eastern Province. Dammam, Alkhobar, and Al-Ahsa will see a theme park on a 100-hectare site in Al-Aziziyah, along with six cinemas and three new entertainment destinations.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess the measures taken by the Malaysian government in the 2019 budget to restore fiscal buffers, improve governance, and regain consumer and investor confidence?</h4><p>It is important to see the budget and policies for 2019 within the context of Malaysia's broader development narrative. The development model of this country has traditionally been based on an export-oriented strategy. Recently, however, questions have been raised about the appropriateness of this model going forward and how Malaysia can shift to a new development model to further climb up the income ladder and reach high-income and developed country status. Part of this challenge is boosting education outcomes and productivity growth. When the new government assumed power, there were a number of challenges it had to confront, and the budgetary cycle was an opportunity for it to unveil its policy directions vis-a-vis these challenges. In the near term, it had to manage its budget and fiscal position, grow the economy, give confidence to the private sector, and protect the vulnerable in society. The government knew it had to strike a careful balance, and we were fairly pleased that the budget included a number of pragmatic elements. We are still fairly positive as the economy still rests on strong fundamentals.</p><h4>What are your expectations around the impact of the National Industry 4.0 Policy Framework on the performance of Malaysia's manufacturing industries?</h4><p>In October 2018, the National Industry 4.0 Policy Framework was launched. Its success will ultimately rest on the ability of firms, particularly SMEs, to adopt new digital technologies. This framework will have to tackle issues like providing credit to firms that need it and getting connected digitally. Our recently completed report on Malaysia's digital economy found that the country was doing fairly well in terms of connectivity and e-services, both on the government and individual levels. The digital adoption rate of firms in Malaysia, however, is relatively low compared to other regional countries. One key factor was the comparatively high prices for fixed broadband services and a lack of competition. The government is now encouraging greater competition in the telecoms sector, which is leading to lower prices and higher digital adoption.</p><h4>How does the World Bank support Malaysia toward realizing better human capital?</h4><p>Human development outcomes around the world need to improve if we are to meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. Over the last two decades, there has been a real emphasis on the development of human capital by various organizations. There has also been a recognition that we are not moving fast enough as a community of nations to meet the challenges of human capital accumulation, particularly in health and education. In the health domain, there are twin challenges of infectious diseases and non-communicable diseases. On the education front, the latest World Development Report highlighted that enrollment rates are insufficient as an indicator of progress; we also have to look at learning outcomes. To that end, the World Bank introduced the new Human Capital Index in 2018, which provides a measure of the future potential of a child born today given the prevailing human development conditions in her or his country. It is both astonishing and encouraging that four of the top five performers of the HCI came from the East Asia and Pacific region. Malaysia did well in certain areas but lagged behind in other areas. The two areas where improvements are needed are in childhood stunting and the quality of education. Another area of concern is the quality of education. The country's most recent scores in education do not compare as well as those of its aspirational peers. We hope to support the government in its efforts to make improvements in this critical area for development. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You have been advocating for “democratic accountability." What institutional reforms are necessary for Malaysia to mature as a democracy?</h4><p>Under Tun Mahathir, we are seeing a beginning of the reform of the judicial process, although it will take some time for all new judicial reforms to take place. While that process unfolds, judges have been asked to ensure that they adjudicate based on facts and law, and not on bribery or political influence, whatever may have happened in the past. For other institutions, such as the Anti-Corruption Commission and law enforcement agencies, we have given a clear signal that the bodies must operate professionally, effectively, and without political interference. There must be greater parliamentary oversight across the board as a check and balance on executive power. We must have a free media that can shine light on the excesses of business and government. I would also add that a critical aspect of the transition is adopting economic policies that are pro-growth and market based, while at the same time considering the welfare of the poor and marginalized who have been largely ignored. We would not be able to sustain progress toward a vibrant democracy if the country leaves the poor and marginalized behind in terms of education and distributive justice. </p><h4>How should Malaysia deal with rising youth unemployment?</h4><p>As a trading nation, Malaysia must attract high-value foreign investment. We must identify the obstacles companies face and develop a competitive and compelling argument for them to bring businesses into our country, particularly in the area of robotics, AI, and high-end technology. Regaining investor confidence requires the government to establish a clear, long-term policy agenda, deliver on the reforms that have been promised, and make investments in the country's education, infrastructure, and regulatory environment. At the same time, our graduates face a skills gap when it comes to filling positions. We need to redouble efforts to train the workforce of the future and ensure that the graduates that are coming into the workforce have what it takes to be competitive in a global economy. </p><h4>What main challenges and opportunities do you foresee for Malaysian manufacturers around the move toward Industry 4.0?</h4><p>Malaysia was a trailblazer in technology adoption, particularly with Malaysia's Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC), in the late 1990s. It is imperative that we accelerate the process and focus on promoting R&amp;D and skills development. There are many in the SME sector who are hesitant to move into Industry 4.0, fearful of the costs they may incur and not yet convinced of the value. The government can play a role in increasing awareness and supporting the investment in capital and human resources necessary for companies to excel. We have to acknowledge that our economy can no longer be labor intensive. We should focus on high-end technology because we have the resources, and invest in skills training and development outside of the university system to ensure that all workers have an opportunity to participate in this new wave of innovation. </p><h4>How should Malaysia regain investor confidence and make Malaysia attractive for FDI?</h4><p>Malaysia's fundamentals are strong, and we cannot deny that as far as ease of doing business is concerned we are competitive within ASEAN. The new government's policies vis-í -vis corruption and transparency have sent a strong signal and our ranking has improved. Eliminating corrupt practices and shady deals will bring costs down for all parties. Furthermore, we can establish administrative bodies such as a Malaysian Arbitration Center to expedite the process of dispute resolution. Many of the problems foreign investors confront in Malaysia can be addressed with efficient administration, and I believe we must do everything we can to respond to their requests. We also need to make rapid improvements to our workforce to ensure workers can fill the jobs of the 21st century. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What have been the opportunities in 2018, and how have they contributed to your growth?<br></strong>We believe that with the new government there are new expectations at the industrial level. There is a feeling of stability at the business level, which is why international companies have returned to the country due to economic credibility. As a result, there will be business growth, low unemployment rates, and a booming construction sector, which in turn means growth for us. We are coming from a period of economic slowdown, so 2018's growth will be below 7%, but the expectations for 2019 are much higher.</p><p><strong>How do you see the government's tax reform plans?<br></strong>The changes are positive for us because there will be support at the business level. The government seeks to reduce tax rates for companies to produce more dynamism and increase the scope of middle-class taxpayers. With the tax reform, companies will have greater cash flow, so that there can be more investment, for example, in innovation. We prioritize innovation because we are looking for new technologies that are environmentally friendly.</p><p><strong>What new product lines is the company looking for, and what role does product innovation play in its corporate strategy?<br></strong>Our vision is to use new technologies that help the environment and reduce those products that may have harmful side effects on people. We recently launched a water-based enamel flooring product useful for courts and parking lots. By making products that do not contain solvents, we can minimize the side effects on people who work with our products. For example, a few years ago, we launched paint with less odors and volatile organic compounds (VOC), which pollute the environment. We are known as the innovators in the Colombian paint industry.</p><p><strong>How do you invest in human capital?<br></strong>A company is not made by its infrastructure but its human capital. We have been focused on this social aspect for many years. We have had our housing policies for 25 years, which has benefited up to 30 families that work with us. Regarding our employees, we offer many benefits, such as housing, education, and vehicle purchases. In terms of housing, the company supports employee savings with interest-free loans. Our goal is to help people with fewer possibilities, such as workers or helpers, in acquiring properties. We also have programs aimed at educating our workforce. For example, we offer support for higher education related to the company by paying half of the tuition and giving out interest-free loans for the other half. Any employee with a standard salary can access these benefits; if the company grows, the entire value chain must also.</p><p><strong>What is the approach of Quí­mí­ca Cosmos toward expanding its client portfolio?<br></strong>We have operations across Colombia and our strategy is to offer personalized attention. Moreover, we hold discussions with our supervisors and commercial managers about product management, health benefits, and strategies for applying new technologies. We seek approaches of knowledge in the entire value chain of the company.</p><p><strong>What is the approach of Quí­mí­ca Cosmos to international markets? What expansion and international growth plans do you have?</strong><br>For now, the country has yet to experience substantial growth levels. Since we are the second paint factory in Colombia, our participation in the market is still small, and we must continue to grow.</p><p><strong>What are your expectations for 2019?<br></strong>We manage two lines of business. The first line is manufacturing and selling paints, whereas the second involves providing raw materials to the paint industry, producing soap for homes and plastics for various uses. Moving forward, we will increase the production of resins and emulsions and undertake procedures to make new construction and expand our presence in the paint industry. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[colombias-time-has-come]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>How has your relocation of regional headquarters to Colombia changed Coca-Cola's regional operations?<br></strong>We had several objectives, the first being to be based in our biggest market with the greatest opportunities. Colombia's time has come, and locating the sector hub in Colombia was in the best interest of the company and its associates. We still have a hub in San José, Costa Rica, and have spread the Board of Directors across those two hubs. There is a great talent pool available in Colombia. Meanwhile, Latin America accounts for a third of the company's global business. Within the totality, it ranks among the top 25 countries in the world, and we intend to make it bigger still. These factors all played a role in our decision to relocate. We saw a steady increase in the volume of sales last year. We are on a learning curve as we progress toward becoming a total beverage company. In 2018, the trademark brand grew at a healthy rate, in particular Sin Azucar, our sugar-free variant. We have launched close to 40 products, and also reformulated about 70% of our products. Some worked really well, others less so. This is part of the learning curve, where we listen to the consumer, make quick tests and reformulations, and repackage accordingly. The great World Cup activation in 2018 was fantastic. As a company with over 30 years in the market, we need to better learn from the market without holding back. We need to learn and experiment just as start-ups do. With that in mind, my number-one goal for 2019 is to see more empowered associates that feel free to experiment and adapt. With empowered associates comes greater innovation and more differentiation in processes for each aspect of the business.</p><p><strong>How is Coca-cola using new technology to revolutionize its processes?<br></strong>We have a co-generation project in Colombia with Air Liquide for power and CO2 to make a plant virtually self-sustaining. We are also using technology to increase the percentage of recycled plastic in our bottles. In Colombia, 42% of the plastic in every bottle on the market is recycled PET, one of the highest percentages in the world. We continue to test technologies to drive that. In 2018, we made a global commitment called World Without Waste to collect and recycle plastic containers equivalent to the amount we produce, and we are well on our way to achieving that. We continue to experiment with technologies in the recuperation of plastic. We are specifically more ahead in the recyclability of our packages. There is considerable work being done to leverage technology. We also work to engage customers in a digital world, encouraging them to become digital natives, and progress there has been brisk. We have in fact hired a vice president of digital with a background in the telecoms industry. He is helping us draft a plan to address and capture that opportunity. Coca-Cola is the most ubiquitous product in the world, and we want to ensure its presence on all platforms. At the close of 2018, 300,000 consumers had downloaded an application that allows them to experience Coca-Cola activities and products. We are testing the app now across Latin America and learning a lot through consumer engagement. It is not only important to connect, but also to bring a consumer closer to the product, ensuring the technology provides the consumer with a sample. This hopefully closes the loop so a prospective consumer becomes a part of your consumer base.</p><p><strong>How is Coca-Cola responding to the changing market demand for new, healthier, products?<br></strong>What we do best is listen to consumers. They want beverages that taste good and want to have variety depending on their preference at any given point. And that is what we are doing. We have reformulated 67% of our portfolio to lower-sugar or sugar-free variants. Many Coca-Cola trademark consumers actually like the red and want an original tasting Coca-Cola. They do not want to be disappointed with the flavor. Even our nectars have low sugar content. From the get go, new products reflect consumers' wishes. We want our nectars to mostly have sugars from the juice base, and not sugar-added, as well as tasting good. The importance of the entire innovation process is that consumers change and look for new variety while maintaining their desire to have something that tastes good. We underwent a new process that prioritized effectiveness and found that when we focus on fewer, bigger, and bolder bets, we do better than when we are spread across different efforts that may dilute our energy and investments. A perfect example is the Red Coke No Sugar instead of Coke Zero. Instead of spending money branding many different brands, we have built one brand, called Coca-Cola with Variants. It is part of being more effective, while at the same time being more efficient because we are marketing one brand instead of three. Over 60% of consumers thought that Coke Zero had sugar. Our CEO has also spoken of killing zombies; the zombies in Coca-Cola are all the little brands and products that exist due to inertia. In this region, we have identified over 100 zombies. We are in the process of killing about 40 of those, and no longer want to waste resources on brands that do not generate growth.</p><p><strong>What will be the next big, bold bet for Coca-Cola in Colombia?<br></strong>There will be a focus on the importance of being there and on availability and affordability. Sometimes we focus on the more glamorous side of business. However, we have a returnable plastic bottle that we relaunched last year with significant investment in Colombia. We want to continue doing that. While it may not wow that much, it will extend our access to families with an affordable, family-sized product in a returnable, environmentally-friendly package, which is a big deal. We will not stop until that package is seen everywhere. Not only is it good for the environment, but also for Colombian families that could otherwise ill afford a Coca-Cola. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>What markets does Bogota Emerald Mart reach?<br></strong><strong>JONNY BAZALEL</strong> We have clients from all over the world, including the US, India, China, Brazil, Europe and the Middle East. Our main markets currently are New York, Jaipur, Hong Kong, and Thailand. Many of our clients in Hong Kong do two or three shows a year. The two main shows are the February/March show, depending on the year, and the September show. Some do the June and November show, which is smaller, though we see many people doing such shows now.</p><p><strong>How does Bogota Emerald Mart assist with the complications that buying emeralds from Colombia might entail?<br></strong><strong>JB</strong> Our clients have been with us for at least 10 years, some for 20-30 years. They know their markets extremely well; however, we bring to the table my father's 40 years of experience, my 15 years, and our competent and experienced sales associate who sit with our clients and ensure they are buying only the highest-quality Colombian emeralds. Our building is unique. We have a laboratory with an extremely qualified gemologist that checks the stones to make sure we are buying the best ones; the building also has a cutting facility to recut or re-polish stones and a laboratory to oil the stones.</p><p><strong>What do your sales associates do to retain the loyalty of these important clients?<br></strong><strong>JB</strong> The most important factor is my father Benny, who has extensive experience in this field. Clients trust him, know him, and know we will not steer them down the wrong path. If we feel a stone is expensive or not for them, we will tell them, even if we might lose the sale. We want to make sure we build a lasting relationship with our clients. We want them to be satisfied with their purchases, and their own clients will then come back, as it is all a productive chain. We want our and their clients to be able to sell. Our sales associates sit down with them throughout the entire trip and help them check the stones by loop, clean, oil, and re-cut if needed, on top of whatever they need, especially providing the required advice.</p><p><strong>What type of new buyers will come to Colombia in the coming years, and how do you plan to reach them?<br></strong><strong>BENNY BAZALEL</strong> We deal mainly with wholesalers because we are a wholesale company and operate with volume. There are many people who want to buy one stone, and we have to turn them down because I cannot technically sell in Colombia since I am an exporter. We look for someone who is trustworthy, has been in this business for a while, and has references. My clients will buy anywhere between USD100,000 and USD1.5 million per trip. On average, they buy USD300,000 per trip.</p><p><strong>JB</strong> My personal plan was to come to Colombia, learn the business in six months to one year, and then move to New York and open an office there. However, I have been here for almost 15 years and am still learning. The business is a daily learning process. I hope that in the next few years, we will see more people involved in this, as there are now many hedge funds that are buying jewelry. Colombian emeralds have only been rising in price. There are many people who want to buy for holding power; gems are not like a car, which goes down in value, or a home that cannot be sold right away. Gems can be sold relatively quickly, and I hope people will start buying jewelry rather than new purses or smartphones because a phone loses 20-50% of its value depending on how old it is, and there is always something new coming out. Colombian emeralds are unique; there is nothing similar to it. Buyers can own something unique for themselves and their families can keep it for the rest of their lives.</p><p><strong>What can we expect from Bogota Emerald Mart in 2019?<br></strong><strong>JB</strong> We will start 2019 strong, and we hope to see more Colombian emeralds in the market. I am pleased that there are many new mining companies coming in and bringing new technology that we did not know about, allowing us to find emeralds faster and with clean technology. There is currently a shortage of green technology. C.I. Bogota Emerald Mart SAS has been helping in the sense that we have started to do our own mining and have purchased shares in two different mines, the Empavas mine in Muzo and Calceteros in Coscuez, and are looking for a few more. These mines are two of the few mines in Colombia that have environmental licenses; of about 600 potential mines, only 15-20 have this license. We hope that moving forward, we will see an influx of merchandise. We are in negotiations with a company that wants to come in and drill with us. Bogotá Emerald Mart will handle all the commercial processing of cutting and selling emeralds. We used to buy around 200kg of rough to send to India, though that has since stopped, as we have been unable to buy in such large amounts. Mining is the future. If we can continue to find large companies that want to come in, invest, and do it properly, that would be ideal. We are currently working on getting the environmental license for another mine in the area of Muzo over 300 acres so that we can start producing and selling more Colombian emeralds. This will definitely be the future of Bogota Emerald Mart. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What were the major achievements for Fortox in 2018?<br></strong>Commercially, we completed the consolidation of sales for the company, for which 2018 was a great year. In terms of operations, it was an interesting year, because we introduced a software that we had been developing for some time, and it was well received in the market. Moreover, strategies that we were using at different operation sites were improved. 2018 had also been a great year because Fortox received different recognitions and awards from clients and the government. In 2019, we aim to grow at twice the rate of GDP.</p><p><strong>What companies partner with Fortox, and how do you broaden your client portfolio?<br></strong>Fortox is a security company that specializes in serving the private industry. About 99.5% of our revenue comes from the private sector. We are administrators of our clients' security risk. In order to achieve that, it is important to have constant training, have everyone on board, and understand our clients' expectations and what they look for. There is a great deal of training and initiatives that need to be done to reach the standard of a private company. This helps us to establish long-term relationships with clients. We specialize in the commercial sector and are working with over 50 shopping centers in Colombia. We are also in industry, where we have many multinational clients, as well as well-known Colombian clients. We also work with ports, residences, and companies in the service sector.</p><p><strong>What has been Fortox's role in helping to improve investor confidence in Colombia?<br></strong>One thing that sets us apart is our focus on human rights. For six years, the company has put great effort into earning recognition for its way of handling people, namely not only its employees but all of its stakeholders. Today, Fortox is recognized as a company with a program of continuous training for its employees. We all have to go to special meetings once a year where we learn about different issues regarding human rights. To date, over 9,000 people have gone through this program, and it is starting to make a difference in the workplace. Clients tell us our guards are truly different in the way they treat and respect people. It was remarkable to receive recognition from congress and receive an award from the Human Rights Council of the Presidency, which includes members from the UNDP, Global Compact, and Fenalper. Notably, Fortox has worked with the International Labor Association. To differentiate ourselves, we need to have an impact on service, even if the client does not pay for it.</p><p><strong>What technological updates has Fortox been working on?<br></strong>When we arrived in Colombia, we sought to implement our enterprise resource planning (ERP). We hired a well-known provider and after a great deal of investment, we realized it was not doing what we needed. Resultingly, we decided to do it ourselves and created an IT division that built our current ERP system. We started developing software not only for our own use but also for access control in buildings and assessing risk management. We have received recognition for being an innovative company, which we are extremely pleased with. In the long run, companies will have to migrate to a stronger IT component.</p><p><strong>What are your plans for the future?<br></strong>At our last strategic meeting in 2017, we set up plans for the coming years, and IT is a big part of them. We also are interested in growing in Colombia; it is a competitive market with over 900 security companies. In Bogotá, there are 540 companies, and we are competing for the same people, not only clients but also employees. We are working to make ourselves more attractive and running several tests. Our international clients ask about our international expansion, and we are looking into this. We have done projects in different countries, but if we go international, it has to be extremely well planned. 2019 will be an interesting year because 2018 was a landmark; we have to consolidate the gains we made and figure out where we can improve. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is the company's business model, and how is it working to improve the nutrition of consumers?<br></strong>First, Nutreo wants to nourish wellness. We want to improve nutrition not only for Colombians, but the world. We believe in the development of children's brains through nutrition. The nutrition they receive in the first 1,000 days and then up to five years old will change their lives forever. In that sense, we want to change and develop our country through excellent nutrition for our kids. We are a B2B business, and we improve nutrition through our allies. For example, we innovate our allies' products by better ingredients, premixes of vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients. We develop, manufacture, and innovate nutritional products to companies that produce food. We add value to food.</p><p><strong>What is the importance of your public nutrition initiatives, and why is Nutreo the ideal partner to achieve these goals?<br></strong>At Nutreo, we believe in the goal we are trying to achieve and are focused on producing good, innovative, and custom-made products for different populations and needs; we know that the better products and innovation in the process, the more people we can reach. Government programs have wide coverage, and the public sector knows where to go and how to connect with those people. That is something that works well for us. If we can provide an excellent product, then the government can get it to the public, and we can help measure the success of those programs in developing human capital. That is why we like to partner with governments that believe in quality products that can change lives. We have to work with the healthcare system because good nutrition is a good preventative measure that lowers sickness rates and develops a healthier population. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What does FIZA offer and why do so many companies choose FIZA as a partner?<br></strong>FIZA was established in 1985, and it has positioned itself as a serious, responsible company providing great service to customers. We have always looked for companies that manufacture machinery on a global level and with cutting-edge technology. FIZA provides solutions for infrastructure engineering and mining in Colombia. We develop technology and implement technologies in Colombia. We serve foreign and national companies involved in 4G projects and have retained our clients throughout our history.</p><p><strong>Why are the development, construction, and maintenance of tertiary roads so complicated, and what solutions does FIZA provide in these areas?</strong><br>Tertiary roads have not developed as they should due to problems with the government, which has never paid attention to them due to a lack of engineering knowledge. In the past, one solution for tertiary roads was a rehabilitation process called footprint plate, an expensive solution without infrastructure or design. Some 80% of tertiary roads have stones. Our project aims to recycle these roads with our technology that allows using the existing material as a granular base thanks to a recycler that crushes, stabilizes, and recycles; as a consequence, construction costs fall by over 80%. This had not been developed because we used to sell recyclers that were too expensive for tertiary roads; however, we now use ones that cost COP400 million (USD127,000) that use agricultural tractors as the main power to work. We are lowering the costs of construction of tertiary roads. We have many machines working nationwide, and we build quickly.</p><p><strong>What is the importance of the development of transportation infrastructure of rural areas to the economy?<br></strong>That represents 100% of the development. Colombia will encounter several problems if it has no roads. Colombia is a pantry of agricultural production; however, agricultural products cannot be exported without tertiary roads. Second, many leave their villages to go to centers like Bogotá because of the lack of good roads in the countryside. If we build tertiary roads, people will return to their villages, traffic will improve, tourism will grow, and there will be other sources of income. Colombia has extremely beautiful areas like Quindí­o, which has many impassable roads. If we make these passable, the economy will grow both in the small municipalities and the national economy. If there are no tertiary roads, the country will not grow.</p><p><strong>What plans does FIZA have for 2019 and beyond?<br></strong>In addition to the project of tertiary roads, we became distributors of machinery that we did not have before. We will become distributors of agricultural tractors that in turn will pull our industrial applications. These have opened the doors to the agricultural market. We represent a company from Poland called Pronar that has all the agricultural accessories. The machines of infrastructure, agricultural, and many other machines need an agricultural tractor, and in Colombia, people do not know about the agricultural tractor and its industrial application. Earlier, we were leaders in the recycling of large machines, and now we are growing. We will distribute a series of additional products from important companies such as Liebherr, Ammann, Fae, and Stehr. We have Rubble Master and SBM crushers that replace all our previous line. We started as a standard distributor for Wacker Nauson in 2017, and this brand will open the doors of small markets such as manual infrastructure machines, compaction plates, water pumps, power plants, and loaders. The world is changing, so we are looking for tractors and many small machines with specific accessories. We must develop in the sale of accessories for tractors that will do the same as large machines but at lower costs and with no downtime. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>In 2018, you told TBY about your goal of building a business with an ethical model based on sustainability. What has been the advantage of this approach in the Colombian market?</strong><br>An ethical approach that has a sustainable basis means conserving resources and employing tools to become more productive. We have to learn to be more effective than others because sustainability demands it from us. We must make an accurate audit of our resources to ensure optimal use. Sustainability is basically an evaluation of how efficient we are in the processes we engage in. Although it seems to be an expensive endeavor, sustainability is a topic of cultural construction and a new business focus aimed at multiplying resources effectively.</p><p><strong>Tito Pabón has a strong focus on its relationship with communities and institutions. How have these efforts contributed to the growth of the business?</strong><br>These actions allow us to best know our clients. We create a space dedicated not to selling, but rather to connecting with the client to understand their needs and focus our research and business on meeting them. A satisfied and well-attended customer is ultimately a spokesperson for our brand.</p><p><strong>What lesson can Tito Pabón give to the corporate world with this narrative?<br></strong>It is time to rethink the concept of business and the meaning of success. We must reflect on how businesses should change and evolve to respond to global situations, such as climate change and the protection of the ozone layer and air quality. These issues seem distant, but it is something that affects everyone. Businesses become alliances or collaborations between communities, where many lessons need to be learned for sustainable business operation, and this is all the more important in today's highly competitive world. </p><p><strong>What is the role of the industry as an agent of change in issues of integration of marginalized populations as ex-combatants?<br></strong>Regarding ex-combatants, we work with external consultants since we lack the expertise to undertake the issue directly. We are working indirectly and learning from these intermediaries.</p><p><strong>Tito Pabón is known for its social impact programs. What programs are you implementing that are different from previous ones?<br></strong>We have operated a gallery for three years as a space for people who have never had the opportunity to experiment with art. Resulting work appeared at the first “Feria del Millón." We have another project in the countryside called Colour on Two Wheels. The countryside is forgetting what it means to ride a bicycle, which is a clean and healthy means of transportation.</p><p><strong>Tito Pabón is a company led by women. How do you evaluate the status of Colombia in terms of gender inclusion in the corporate world?</strong><br>We are still learning, but there is a definite transition; we have to understand that change is for the better and that we can all contribute. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[at-the-coalface]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>How has 2018 been for Coquecol?<br></strong>We restarted 100% of our operative coke batteries to produce approximately 280.000 tons of coke. This permitted us to have sales of approximately 1 million tons, including metallurgical coke and coal. In revenue, we have close to USD109 million in metallurgical coke and US92 million in coal. Total sales of the company in 2018 was close to USD201 million, achieving a growth of 69% in net sales and complying with 106.6% of the expected commercial budget. Furthermore, we have increased production and efficiency in our plants and strengthened the supply strategy through the purchase of Intercarbon Mining SAS.</p><p><strong>Why do corporate giants choose Colombian metallurgical coal?<br></strong>Colombia is the only producer of metallurgical coal in the region to attend to markets like Brazil, which consumes close to 10 million tons per year of met coal and perhaps close to 2 million of met coke. Furthermore, Mexico is also a major consumer of this raw material; therefore, Colombia has great potential because it is close to Brazil and Mexico, and we have a high quality of met coal and met coke; this allows for our industry to work with the best companies that provide this raw material. In addition, we have big clients in other countries, like India, the UK, South Africa, Canada, Poland, and the Netherlands.</p><p><strong>What would you consider Coquecol's key export markets besides Brazil and Mexico?<br></strong>Latin America is extremely important in our portfolio because we have a long-term contract with Gerdau to provide coal for 10 years. Our other market is for smelting coke that we produce in the north of Colombia for the market of ferroalloys. The results of this line of business in 2018 were extremely successful because of high demand. Our main clients in 2018 were in Asia, America, Africa, and Europe.</p><p><strong>How would you describe Coquecol's approach to responsible mining in an environmental sense?<br></strong>We work closely with our coal providers to ensure they produce it the right way. We supervise the mines and support them with equipment, technology, technical support, geologists, mining engineers, and so on. For example, we have miners and families that have worked with us for 10 years. They initially produced 400 tons per month, and today that same mine produces 5,000 tons per month. In addition, we have a strong government model to support our operation, and our environmental policy expresses the commitment to pollution prevention, continuous improvement, and compliance with legislation.</p><p><strong>Can you elaborate on Fundación Coquecol?<br></strong>The foundation has had important developments in the last year. We have four areas of interest; education, family, environment, and relationships. We support education in two ways: we help to refurbish the infrastructure of small schools in various towns and support teachers with university degrees, courses, and so on to increase their capabilities and qualifications. We provide financial aid to around 48 students per semester to go to the university. In addition, Coquecol has strict policies regarding its contracts with providers and suppliers and the way we manage that. We are a legal company in terms of government requirements. We work closely with the mayors of the small towns where we have our plants, supporting them with investments and supporting the community in general. Every year, we develop courses for the community and many programs for the small towns.</p><p><strong>What is your outlook for 2019 and the short term?<br></strong>We will continue working with focus in our main strategic goals to guarantee sustainability, improve productivity and profitability, develop innovation, and strengthen our organizational culture within the market. Projections of global growth lower than 2018 have a significant impact on important economies such as the US and China. In this way, we will continue walking on the path of consolidating Coquecol as the leading company in the metallurgical coal market in Colombia. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[quality-shining-through]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What role does Green Shine play in the emerald sector?<br></strong>Green Shine was created in 2000, though my experience in the sector comes from my parents and grandparents. Green Shine is one of the main exporters of emeralds in the country. We continuously participate in international fairs in Hong Kong and Las Vegas. We have an office in Hong Kong and will soon have another in New York. Our main clients are in Hong Kong, from where we distribute to China, India, and Thailand. Meanwhile, from the US, we ship emeralds to Europe. Demand for Colombian emeralds is growing because it is unique in its quality. People in China and India truly love our product and frequently seek these emeralds.</p><p><strong>This sector is receiving large sums of investment. How is this being reflected in the evolution of the sector?<br></strong>The Colombian emerald sector is undergoing a process of transformation to become among the most modern in the world. As a result, the process is clearer and can be easily tracked. This makes it easier to trace the origin of an emerald. This ensures it is a legal process and that the emeralds are mined ethically. International companies have invested in Colombia and helped professionalize the sector, and we are pioneers in this sector worldwide. Colombian emeralds are in demand worldwide; they are an established name, and those who want fine emeralds will demand Colombian emeralds.</p><p><strong>What role has Green Shine played in that regard?<br></strong>We are a company that commercializes emeralds abroad. Everything that we buy, we sell abroad. Our products are easier for jewelers to modify and adapt to different designs.</p><p><strong>What potential do you see in GCC countries?<br></strong>There is great potential in GCC countries. Most Colombian emeralds end up in China, India, and Middle Eastern countries. There is also much more to be done to boost production in Colombia.</p><p><strong>Why is Green Shine the best option to buy emeralds in Colombia?<br></strong>We are the best option because of our heritage, and because we buy our emeralds directly from the mines. We also assure clients that we can do the entire process, from purchasing the emerald in the mine to sculpting and carving the gem. As we are able to trace the entire process, we can ensure a cleaner production process across the entire chain. In that regard, we also work with international jewelers to generate greater interest in emeralds.</p><p><strong>What new investments do you plan for the future?<br></strong>As for the mining sector, we are in Fura, Nuevo Milenio, and Gachalan. Besides this, we are also entering new mines and buying stocks.</p><p><strong>What legal challenges does the sector face?<br></strong>When the government legislates the sector, it lumps all minerals and gems together. We want the government to understand there has to be a different regulation for precious metals and jewels. Right now, we have the same legislation as coal, for instance. The current law does not understand the specifications of products like emeralds. Thus, we require a specific legislation for emeralds because they are different from other minerals. In addition, we need assistance in terms of boosting exports because it can take up to two days to process one export, while in other countries the entire process just takes one or two hours.</p><p><strong>What percentage of your sales goes through your Hong Kong office?<br></strong>About 30% of our sales are done in our Colombian office. We also have a broker in New York who conducts sales in the US. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[For the Future]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[for-the-future]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the cornerstones of your agenda for Sabah?</h4><p>Under the new government led by Parti Warisan Sabah (Sabah Heritage Party), we are striving to achieve a sustainable form of progress and development, driven by policies for economic growth, environmental protection, and social equity. The interests and welfare of Sabahans always come first in our agenda. In our pursuit of economic growth, we make every effort to satisfy the needs of the people but not at the expense of our precious natural resources. This is important to ensure that future generations will continue to enjoy Sabah's rich and unique biodiversity. To that end, environmental protection plays a crucial part, and we fully appreciate that the foundation for keeping our ecosystem as pristine as possible is to make sure that wildlife and flora are well taken care of and not exploited needlessly. Therefore, we are allocating special zones in our rainforests so wild animals can still have their own sanctuary where they are free to roam and thrive. Likewise, social equity plays a crucial part in Sabah's direction to greater progress and prosperity, and our policy stresses on the importance of meeting the needs of all Sabahans regardless of race and religion. As a multiracial and multicultural society, social equity is important to uphold and maintain unity in Sabah. For progress and prosperity to become real, Sabahans must embrace their diversity. We also have zero tolerance for any kind of extremism, whether racial or religious.</p><h4>How are you planning to boost human capital development in Sabah?</h4><p>Since forming the new government in 2018, we have set up a Ministry of Education and Innovation to tailor make courses in order to produce human capital that serves specific industries ranging from hospitality to oil and gas. The mainstream curriculum taught in schools will be supplemented with courses that emphasize on skills. There will be greater focus on skills for specific Sabah-based industries in vocational institutions. Professional occupations in medicine, law, and engineering, among others, remain important, but greater emphasis will be placed on skill training.</p><h4>How do you view the potential to further develop Sabah as a tourism hub?</h4><p>Sabah has vast potential to be developed further as a tourism hub. From the mountain tops of the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Kinabalu Park to the deepest waters of the internationally renowned diving treasure of Sipadan Island, there are plenty of attractions to hold any visitor spellbound. What is needed is a more efficient form of coordination and synergy to bring all these attractions together so that they not only offer a visual treat but also create a deeper appreciation for nature. With over 32 ethnic tribes in Sabah, each with their own distinct culture, just discovering about the people in this Land Below the Wind is in itself another attraction for tourists. We seek to increase the number of direct international flights to the Kota Kinabalu International Airport and with our strategic geographical location, we have high hopes of securing that to boost tourism. Similarly, Sabah sits perfectly on the path of cruise liners, and this certainly holds potential that can be explored further.</p><h4>How do you assess the ease of doing business in Sabah?</h4><p>Investors will not find it terribly difficult to conduct business in Sabah because of our strategic location within the ASEAN region and the Southeast Asian trade route. There are already tax incentives put in place by the Malaysian government.</p><h4>Where do you see the greatest untapped investment opportunities in Sabah?</h4><p>Food production is one such opportunity. Food production in Sabah is largely limited to cottage industries. One example is the honey produced by stingless bees, which are highly prized for its medicinal benefits; however, no major investor has tapped into this. Tawau is one district where tropical fruits such as rambutan, mangoes, and durian can be grown without the use of chemicals and pesticides. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Connectivity for equality]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[connectivity-for-equality]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What role will ICT play in the government's plan to develop the economy?<br></strong>ICT's role is central and takes up a whole chapter in the National Development Plan. If we look at other sectors such as health, education, labor, transportation, and agriculture, technology is all over the place. Our role is to make citizens' lives easier. That is what the digital transformation effort is all about: putting citizens and companies at the center and ensuring the government supports initiatives to make our workforce more competitive and our citizens happier. One of the most important things we are doing within the National Development Plan is a bill in Congress now that modernizes the sector. President Duque has three pillars in his policies: legality, entrepreneurship, and equality. This bill hits equality directly and the others indirectly; as one becomes more connected, things such as fighting corruption become much easier with technology behind them. On the entrepreneurial end, it is easier when the government provides services rather than asking you to do everything. On the equality end, it is hard to find a better tool for equality rather than making sure everyone is connected. Our map of 4G connectivity is extremely concentrated, and a large portion of the country does not have it yet. We are working extremely hard to fix that by changing the criteria by which we assign spectrum and doubling the number of years, plus shifting away from maximizing financial income to reduce the digital gap. That will give us the tools to reach more Colombians and provide more connectivity, and that will make a huge change in terms of the way Colombians live.</p><p><strong>How will improved broadband access change the Colombian economy in coming years?<br></strong>It will make it much more dynamic and innovative. There is a direct link between download speed and innovation. Colombia's download speed is half the global average and one-third of the OECD average, and our goal is to raise it to the OECD average. That one indicator is a huge leap in terms of growth, productivity, and changing people's lives. There are 20 million Colombians who do not have access to broadband right now, and if we can connect them, it will be significant. We also have huge quality challenges as well, so it is not just about connecting more people, but also about connecting them better. That means not just having high-quality connectivity, but also working with the population to make sure it is being used for more than just viral content. It needs to be used for things that improve companies or make someone a professional or a more informed person, getting access to content that they would not have otherwise.</p><p><strong>How will the ICT sector continue to be a driver for growth in Colombia?<br></strong>I do not see us as a sector in itself as much as a facilitator for growth in all other sectors. There is no sector that does not use technology or that does not need innovation; we have to pull that innovation and technology and bring it to all the other sectors. It creates new opportunities for people who may not have had them. That is a big change from where we were used to a certain number of years spent for degrees or certifications. Frankly, if you know how to program, get on board; we need you. We are pushing to help people get excited about it. I am part of a small group of women in tech, and we are convinced that the younger the ages of the girls when we reach them, the more impact we can have, as they consider careers in tech. The number of women versus men in the tech sector in particular is always behind, and not just in Colombia. When one is a woman in tech, they have to do their part to inspire other women and especially younger girls to think about it.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you elaborate on your plans to boost productivity by reskilling and upskilling workers?</h4><p>All employers from 63 sub-sectors within three key economic sectors (services, manufacturing, and mining and quarrying) are obliged to register with the Human Resources Development Fund (PSMB) and pay a 1% Human Resources Development (HRD) levy of their total Malaysian employees' salary for human capital development (HCD) initiatives. As of October 31, 2018, the total number of PSMB-registered employers is 24,627, and these employers hire 2.24 million Malaysian employees. The agency offers financial assistance and training schemes that are driven by its registered employers' training demands, encompassing technical and soft skill trainings in domestic and international courses, setup of training rooms and relevant facilities within an employer's working space, as well as facilitating training for disabled and future workers. Recently, PSMB established a full-fledged customer engagement team tasked with identifying the training demands and challenges among its registered employers. More recently, in the 2019 budget announcement under the technical and vocational education and training (TVET) initiative, the government will allocate PSMB a MYR20-million matching grant for the implementation of two TVET driven programs: an Apprenticeship Program and the Graduates Enhancement Program for Employability (GENERATE). These programs are targeted at school leavers and graduates, respectively, helping them to become job-ready while simultaneously ensuring higher productivity levels. From 1993 to October 2018, over 19.7 million local employees of PSMB-registered employers benefited from these schemes, and in 2019, PSMB targets approximately 1.2 million people. Boosting productivity by reskilling and upskilling workers is one of the most important aspects of human capital development.</p><h4>Is there a skills mismatch between university curricula and professional requirements on the labor market?</h4><p>Though we need graduates, there seems to be an issue of a skills mismatch in terms of university curricula and the professional requirements from the labor market. Universities in Malaysia fall under the purview of the Ministry of Education, and it is taking steps to address this issue. On the part of the Ministry of Human Resources, there are several initiatives to prepare local workforces for the future. Among these are conducting a TVET Master Plan Study that encompasses the issues of TVET's demand and supply toward addressing the issues of skills and industry needs, including the challenges of Industry 4.0 and ensuring high employability among TVET graduates with better pay. In order to enhance the quality of TVET and in line with the needs of Industry 4.0, this study will address the aspect of curriculum restructuring, upgrading of facilities and training equipment, professional development of TVET instructors, and other related matters. Another of our initiatives is the review of the National Occupational Skills Standard (NOSS) to meet the current knowledge and skills in the era of digitalization, automation, or Industry 4.0 required by industrial players. </p><h4>How will the government enhance the participation rate of women in senior positions?</h4><p>The 11th Malaysia Plan emphasizes on anchoring growth on people, focusing on empowering human capital, including women talent. The 2019 Budget clearly reflects the government's concern on this matter, and the government is taking the lead in encouraging women to contribute to the economy and pushing for more women in leadership roles. Further to this, there is also a push to increase women on boards to 30% by 2020. To support this agenda, the government also announced tax exemption on employment income to be enjoyed by women on who return to the workforce. Furthermore, the Career Comeback Program under TalentCorp aims to encourage employers to recruit and retain female talent in the workforce. To date, we have placed 694 women in the workforce since the launch of this program with an average monthly salary of MYR7,000-8,000. Moving forward, TalentCorp is highly committed to advancing this initiative forward with the support of the Ministry of Human Resources. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[on-a-growth-trajectory]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess Malaysia's trade performance over the past year?</h4><p>In 2018, Malaysia continued to record a record-breaking trade performance by registering positive growth amid the high-base effect of 2017. Malaysia's total trade expanded by 5.9%, valued at MYR1.876 trillion. The total export value has jumped closer to the MYR1-trillion mark, growing by 6.8% to reach MYR998.28 billion, while imports grew by 4.9% to MYR877.76 billion. The trade balance grew 22.3% to surpass the MYR100-billion mark and reach MYR120.52 billion, the highest level since 2012. Amid global headwinds, Malaysia's trade remained healthy with growing exports and imports, maintaining an upward growth momentum with trade surplus recorded for over two decades. China, Singapore, the US, Japan, and Thailand were Malaysia's top-five trading partners in 2018, accounting for slightly over 50% of total trade. Singapore was the largest export market for Malaysia, followed by China, the US, Hong Kong, and Japan.</p><h4>What are the main opportunities for Malaysian manufacturers around the move toward Industry 4.0?</h4><p>In essence, Industry 4.0 adoption is a major shift toward propelling productivity and enhancing competitiveness. The growth of Industry 4.0 will provide greater avenue for Malaysian companies to short circuit the growth cycle as it enables businesses to grow quickly and access new markets. Alternatively, companies can move up the value chain by providing more customized products, through the use of existing experience and data as well as investing in machines and particularly in CAD technology. The economic impact of Industry 4.0 could noticeably be significant for Malaysia's manufacturing industry, especially sectors that are involved in development and marketing of products. </p><h4>How does MATRADE help local SMEs to prepare themselves trends in international trade?</h4><p>SMEs account for about 90% of businesses and more than 50% of employment across the world and are therefore a crucial backbone of any economy. In Malaysia, SMEs represent 98.5% of registered companies. It is critical to ensure that Malaysian SMEs are well prepared to expand and explore new markets overseas. Currently, SMEs' contribution to exports is 17.3%, and MATRADE plays a pivotal role to assist export-ready SMEs to increase their contribution. For 2019, MATRADE has outlined 437 activities for exporters development, aimed to accelerate and strengthen the contribution of Malaysian companies, mainly SMEs, to exports. Going forward, we will continue to develop opportunities for companies to succeed in international trade by assisting SMEs to expand in the export market and grow as future mid-tier companies (MTCs) who will become regional and global champions. MATRADE has implemented an e-trade program with the aim of accelerating exports by encouraging Malaysian companies to adopt cross border e-commerce by participating in international e-commerce platforms. Taking advantage of the growing e-commerce trend, more than 2,800 companies have participated in the eTRADE program, penetrating more than 35 markets. MATRADE's Exporters Development programs aim to assist around 10,000 exporters in 2019. For export-ready companies and SMEs, a total of 40 trade promotional programs will be implemented in 2019, which includes participation in iconic trade fairs and exports acceleration missions. The strong network of MATRADE's 46 trade offices overseas will help provide market intelligence reports and product market studies and update our Malaysian exporters with the latest business trends and opportunities.</p><h4>How do you envision Malaysia's role in further building the global halal market?</h4><p>Malaysia has to ensure that its halal ecosystem keeps on progressing with support and new initiatives from various government agencies, trade associations, financial institutions, universities, and industry players. Based on Thomson Reuters' GIEI 2018/19 Report, the global Islamic economy is expected to reach USD5.9 trillion in 2022. In 2018, Malaysia's export of halal products was MYR40 billion. Based on the Halal Industry Master Plan (2008-2020), Malaysia's export of halal products will reach MYR50 billion in 2020. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Malaysia has been moving up the Global Innovation Index. How does this contribute to further developing Malaysia as a preferred R&amp;D hub?</h4><p>In 2018, Malaysia came in 35th place overall, moving up two positions YoY. Among ASEAN and upper-middle income countries, Malaysia is ranked second after Singapore and China, respectively. Malaysia's improvement in these rankings reflects the country's strength in tertiary education, knowledge diffusion, and creative goods and services. In particular, Malaysia ranks among the top five for graduates in science and engineering, ease of protecting minority investors, high-tech imports and exports, and creative goods exports. We seek to attract more companies, particularly large MNCs, to set up their R&amp;D activities here. Malaysia has five public universities that were granted research universities (RU) status to promote R&amp;D activities, enhance commercialization, increase post-graduate and post-doctoral student intake, and improve the country's global standing. MIDA has been stepping up its efforts to drive stronger R&amp;D linkages between the industry and tertiary and research institutions. It is a tax-efficient way to invest in R&amp;D whereby industry partners can access these universities' expertise while enabling the academia to produce more research with higher commercial potential. The Public-Private Research Network (PPRN) by the Ministry of Education closes the technological knowledge gap, increases productivity, and strengthens Malaysian economic development through innovation and commercialization programs. The emphasis on R&amp;D as reflected in the 11th Malaysia Plan 2016-2020, focuses on translating innovation to wealth by strengthening relational capital to foster stronger linkages, collaboration, and trust among stakeholders. Under the Industry4WRD initiative, one of the Strategic Enablers includes “Technology." Under this enabler, we aim to intensify research, innovation, commercialization, and entrepreneurship (RICE) programs and activities in Industry 4.0 technologies and processes that support advance priority sectors.</p><h4>How does MIDA facilitate investors to connect with the local infrastructure?</h4><p>MIDA has facilitated over 5,000 companies from more than 40 countries to make Malaysia their location for manufacturing and related services operations. MIDA also undertakes several initiatives to facilitate domestic investments and advocate the development of supply chains between Malaysian companies and MNCs and large corporations. These include supply chain initiatives such as the Industrial Linkages program in aerospace for companies to explore business and investment opportunities through strategic partnerships and joint ventures; the establishment of the Investment Coordination Platform (ICP) to facilitate companies to grow their businesses and investment portfolio; the introduction of MIDA's i-Services Portal, a single market place to link investors and companies; and the outreach programs such as the 2018 nationwide forum series on industrial parks.</p><h4>What are your key objectives for 2019?</h4><p>Last year, MIDA recorded a significant increase of 169.3% for approved FDI in the manufacturing sector worth a total of MYR58 billion, compared to MYR21.6 billion in 2017. We continue to focus on strengthening growth and increasing productivity, creating new generations of jobs and reducing dependency on foreign labor as well as attracting high levels of quality FDI and direct domestic investment. With the launch of Industry4WRD, Malaysia's key objectives for 2019 in this context revolve around growing local companies with the MNCs and providing reinforcement into Industry 4.0 adoptions. Structural efforts have been taken to mitigate foreign labor dependency and transition labor intensive sectors into automation and digitalization. This effort will continue as one of the key objectives for 2019. It will also contribute to productivity growth. Labor productivity in the manufacturing sector improved from 2.2% in 3Q18 to 2.5% in 2Q18. While this is positive growth, greater improvement is needed to reach a productivity level of 3.7% by 2019. Industry-ready talent is another focus area for 2019. Initiatives are being undertaken to review and revamp the current education system to ensure the curriculum is in line with the development and progress of technology. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What were the main highlights for MTC in 2018?<br></strong>2018 was a good year. Production was strong, and in addition to mine modernization, which has continued, the plan in the free trade zone has achieved some of the best cutting of emeralds anywhere in the world. In 2018, a significant achievement was the World Emerald Symposium, a coming of a new age for the Colombian emerald industry. The emerald industry in Colombia was informal and had many challenges. After this symposium, things changed, and the demand for Colombian emeralds remains strong. As a matter of fact, it is difficult to meet demand. For Colombia, 2018 was a year during which the industry matured.</p><p><strong>What does the modernization of mining techniques mean for the Colombian emerald sector?<br></strong>Previously, the mines were mainly artisanal; they were worked by pick and shovel. It was traditional and there was not much technology involved. There is still some of that, but today much more is done by mechanized means.</p><p><strong>How has mechanization changed, and will it change as it advances?<br></strong>Even though we can mechanize some of the production, we still require manual labor because of the nature of emeralds. We can use different technologies to determine where to dig and discover where the emeralds are. Though ramps are not generally productive themselves, we can put them in productive tunnels, which allow us to transport equipment and make it more comfortable, all while improving safety.</p><p><strong>How, in terms of formalization and legality, has the emerald trade changed in Colombia?<br></strong>The global gem trade has changed, and that change is driving our efforts. Within the legitimate gem trade, many things have changed because people have become more aware of the social impacts of mining. As a result, customers demand traceability in emeralds or evidence of proper labor conditions. We have taken steps to assure our ultimate customer that our products from our mine are produced under the correct conditions. We want to make sure clients know these are legitimate emeralds, because it is the right thing to do and this is what the market demands. The government was not that active in this regard, though the situation in Colombia has improved. In addition, the government has started to pay much more attention not just to the mining industry but also everything, including the environment. It has naturally taken more interest in areas such as the emerald industry and has fostered formalization and legalization. For us, it has been positive, because we have been implementing these changes already. We are by far the largest mine, and by implementing these changes we are helping to set the standard for the entire industry. We have enjoyed support from the government for this.</p><p><strong>What markets does MTC help Colombia reach?<br></strong>We help Colombia reach the entire world: China, Japan, the US, Europe, Asia, and India. Our business is to sell emeralds, and we will sell them to any legitimate entity in the global market.</p><p><strong>MTC has spoken about its vision to have a positive impact on the communities it works in. What impact does the company have?<br></strong>From the beginning, it was evident that if we wanted to operate in Colombia, especially in a rural area, we needed to have a good relationship with the communities, or else we would not be going anywhere. If the community rejects a company, they will have problems. We have a talented and experienced social responsibility manager who has worked to provide services to communities such as helping local schools. We help the local public health system as well, making an investment in the local hospital. We also built a dining hall where we feed around 300 indigent elderly people a day.</p><p><strong>What can we expect from MTC in 2019?<br></strong>You can expect more production. We want to take the lessons from recent years and put them to work and keep exploring. We still have many areas to explore for emeralds, so we are optimistic. Things should go well. Sales are not a problem for us. We may launch some major projects, such as establishing a line of jewelry ourselves. We are working on a number of other ventures at an international level. We expect a great year in 2019. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What role does Drummond play in the economy of Colombia and the region?<br></strong>Since we started exporting from Colombia in 1995, we have been growing our production and exports of Colombian coal to become the largest player in the market. Coal is the second-largest export product of Colombia, and Drummond exports 100% of its coal. Drummond set a goal to export approximately 32.5 million tons of coal in 2019. We have been investing in mine, port, and railroad infrastructure so that today our port has an installed capacity of 60 million tons. We have invested in mining equipment and training as well. Depending on the market situation, we plan to continue growing at a comfortable level, as we have done in the past. We have three more mining concessions that have not yet been exploited. Together with the ones currently in production, we have cumulative reserves of 1.3 billion tons, which are enough to last more than 30 years. The reserves left at La Loma alone are 60 million tons. At present, 70% of our production comes from El Descanso North and 30% from La Loma. We are not operating in other areas yet and are working on our future mining plans.</p><p><strong>What can you tell us about Drummond's integrated and multifaceted approach toward the environment?<br></strong>We can do much more backfilling with our integrated operations. Once we finish production at La Loma, we will enter El Descanso South. This way we are able to take some overburden from the new areas and deposit it at the area behind. This is much better for environmental purposes because it reduces the traffic of mining equipment, which means less emissions. It also requires fewer waste dumps outside of the mining area. As we advance, we also recover previous areas and waste dumps. We have been seeding these areas, and we have recovered over 1,000ha. We are always trying to reduce our impact on the environment. We also have a strong commitment to the surrounding communities. We are working in multiple strategic areas in our social responsibility programs and developed a strategy focused on four main objectives: peace and human rights, economic development, strengthening institutions, and environmental management. When we started operations, this region was lacking a strong government presence. We immediately started communicating with the community to understand their needs and expectations, and we designed our programs accordingly. At that time, we identified the main concerns to be education, health, and job development programs. The first problem we identified was a lack of infrastructure, which is why we invested heavily in this. Since then we have also worked on improving the quality of education and expanding our presence.</p><p><strong>What can we expect from Drummond in the coming years?<br></strong>We want to continue being an important investor in Colombia and contribute to the economy and development. We also want Colombia to continue being an important source of coal for the world. We are also in initial phases to enter the oil and gas sector. We are committed and will see how it develops in the country. Lately, there has been a great deal of discussion about shifting to renewables, and the company has been a part of that important discussion. We need consistent and constant energy sources to supply energy at a steady level. In light of recent developments, the end users and clients want to know not only the quality of the coal but also how it is produced. This is why we were the first company in the world to participate in an assessment under the Bettercoal code, an initiative from the most important European coal buyers. There are 10 basic standards they use to evaluate, with over 150 criteria on ethics, human rights, social investment, the environment, and so on. We started participating in 2014 and since then have been reassessed twice. If you look at those reports, Drummond has received the best evaluation. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>What role does SPEC play in Colombia's move toward natural gas?<br></strong>SPEC LNG is the only LNG import terminal in Colombia and a key asset to assure a sustainable and clean energy matrix. Our main role is to guarantee the long-term supply of natural gas for electricity generation in Colombia as we enable the connection to international LNG markets and provide the flexibility needed for the thermal generation in the country.</p><p><strong>How does the terminal's capacity relate to existing demand? What further investments will be necessary with future growth in demand?</strong><br>On normal hydrology levels, Colombia consumes about 1 billion cbft a day of natural gas, and SPEC LNG represents 40% of that since we have the capacity to regasify 400 million cbft a day. However, our current role is to satisfy the needs of the electrical system by serving our clients, who represent 40% of the installed capacity in thermal generation of the country and 20% of total demand for electricity in Colombia. As for further investments, we do not have concrete plans in the short term but are constantly evaluating opportunities to contribute to the development of LNG markets considering the fact that our terminal is connected to the national grid. Our geographic location is also extremely strategic because we are close to the LNG sources of supply of the region and next to important shipping routes.</p><p><strong>What environmental advantages does natural gas present for Colombia, and what does the reliability of natural gas mean for development?</strong><br>Colombia has been using natural gas for over 45 years and has been successful in its development to different uses, such as residential, commercial, vehicles, industrial, and thermal generation. Colombia's current energy matrix, which is 70% hydro and 30% thermal, is one of the most competitive and clean matrices of Latin America. The fact that SPEC guarantees the supply of natural gas for electricity generation in the long term ensures Colombia's energy matrix will maintain its competitiveness and clean energy standing. In addition, considering the potential for renewables that the country has, thermal generation is the best complement for a robust and reliable energy system.</p><p><strong>What can we expect from SPEC LNG in 2019?<br></strong>SPEC will continue to offer the reliability in terms of natural gas supply necessary to meet all Colombia's electrical needs, more importantly when the probability of the occurrence of an El Niño event during 2019 is high. In the first four months of 2019, we received three LNG carriers and loaded just over 240,000cbm of LNG compared to 550,000cbm of LNG in 2018. The way our terminal will operate during 2019 will depend on several factors, such as hydrology levels, electrical system infrastructure, and thermal generation demand. More importantly, it will offer Colombia the reliability it needs to support its electric demand at any moment. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>What internal processes have you changed in the company?<br></strong>We have been reviewing our processes and practices as well as negotiating agreements and looking for new efficiencies. In 2018, we saved around COP60 billion (USD18.9 million), which represents 20% of the company's cost base. This made us more efficient, and we plan to have additional savings for 2019. We decided to make these changes gradually, so we do not have a negative impact on our employees and the communities we work in. We also have a restructuring process in our company's financial liabilities. All these together enabled us to have great results and a strong base for the coming years. One of our main goals is to diversify our electricity production, for which we are working with interesting wind projects that are already in the licensing or investment process. The idea is to have a strong company.</p><p><strong>In 2016, Canadian company Brookfield acquired most of ISAGEN's shares. What are the effects of this action?<br></strong>All the changes the company went through are not due to the change of ownership, but because the company realized the importance of doing so. We are one of Brookfield's biggest assets in the world, and these new results have been a pleasant surprise for it. Brookfield is also committed to the country and to making new investments, for example, by providing Bogotá with natural gas. There are great opportunities in the country for investments in the infrastructure sector. ISAGEN is an important company due to the quality of its plants and operations as well as its security and projects development. Moreover, this is a growing market that will grow even more in the future. This made us an interesting acquisition for Brookfield.</p><p><strong>ISAGEN is currently investing in wind projects in La Guajira. Can you tell us more about these projects and the future of wind energy in Colombia?</strong><br>La Guajira is one of the most important places around the world when it comes to wind potential. Our access to natural resource there grants us many opportunities. We have some projects for the area, some of which are more developed than others, and there is a bright future in this area. The government has created interesting tax and regulatory incentives that boost the sector. We currently have three different types of projects. The first one helps us test our business model. Then, we have Guajira 2, which is currently in the closing process of the previous consults and the environmental permit. Our short-term goal is to operate a small project that will test our investment thesis that we can then use for larger projects. The company believes wind energy will grow in Colombia, and it is a business that we want to be in.</p><p><strong>As one of the biggest energy providers in the country, what is ISAGEN's role regarding the protection of the Colombian environment?</strong><br>One of the most interesting programs of the company concerns water and watershed protection. If we do not protect the water sources where we operate, we will run out of our prime resource. We are working together with communities to protect these watersheds, reforest the areas, and prevent the release of polluted waters into rivers. By doing so, we guarantee that our operations are sustainable, and people in the communities defend and want us. There are fewer problems with environmental entities and communities.</p><p><strong>What is in store for ISAGEN in 2019 and beyond?<br></strong>We want to continue to work efficiently and generate more value. We have an interesting project portfolio that we are working with, and we see excellent opportunities for growth. In addition, we are always open to new opportunities. This is a business that is rapidly evolving, and we need to adjust our company every time for new opportunities. Our company is a long-term business, so the decisions we make do not show results in one year, but 30-50 years later. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>The oil and gas sector is recovering after a difficult period. How was 2018 for SUMMUM?<br></strong>It was a positive year for the company, where we saw double-digit growth over 2017. Our staff doubled to 1,200 employees, which reflects the new contracts and businesses that we were able to generate in 2018. Additionally, in terms of portfolio and customers, we attracted 40% more companies in Colombia, Mexico, and Peru. Furthermore, we forecast a growth in sales of 20% in 2019. We are extremely competitive, and our success rate in proposals made against those won has also increased considerably. In Peru, our operation had only one client a year ago and today has four. We have operated an office with a certain position in Mexico for nine years and continue to generate business.</p><p><strong>What is your outlook for the oil and gas investment environment in Colombia in the coming years?<br></strong>We have a positive outlook. Companies have unfortunately become accustomed to working in a pricing environment that generates little financial gain. In 2018, certain Colombian oil operators reported strong numbers, but still put pressure on prices for services companies like us, which led them to remain without suppliers and certain services required for their projects, thus hampering investment plans. Oil operators must understand that service companies also need to generate financial value. In short, they should review the prices they offer to suppliers as our margins remain tight, despite the inherent risks in the field.</p><p><strong>How does SUMMUM's innovative approach help it face particular challenges in the Colombian market?<br></strong>In 2018, we started with a strong strategy called Ruta SUMMUN 2018-2021. The job of the organization's management committee was to analyze the company's potential position for the coming four years, what it should change to improve, where to innovate, and what lines of business to integrate into its service portfolio. External consultants supported us by generated the roadmap for the Ruta SUMMUN 2018-2021. Having reviewed our current business lines, we identified certain additional technologies that could be integrated into some of those business lines. We also reviewed our partnerships and are looking for key players with specific characteristics in order to penetrate new markets. While we are pleased with our performance in the Mexican market, there are further opportunities to tap in North, Central, and South America. We have offices in Mexico City, Colombia, and Peru. Interesting businesses are in the pipeline. Our evaluations have been translated into concrete projects that will involve the entire company. In 2019, we have to work hard to cover the schedule we have established. 2018 was one of structuring and defining projects, and 2019 will see the start of some of those projects.</p><p><strong>SUMMUM was the first oil and gas company to be part of the anti-corruption business commitment for transparency in Colombia. What is the potential of such initiatives to transform the Colombian corporate world?</strong><br>We have worked hard for three or four years in our commitment to compliance, and on strict adherence to the law in all jurisdictions in which we operate. We have reinforced our compliance work and actively participate in related discussions. SUMMUM has clear operational procedures. We wanted to be part of a representative entity to give opinions and listen to other companies as a good internal practice of our own operations. We are proud to be the only oil and gas company to do so, and this year, we have further initiatives along that line. For example, we will become ISO certified against corruption. We will continue participating in forums because there is an essential challenge to the dirty game that blights everyone in Colombia and the region. This effort cannot come from individual governments alone; the private sector must also contribute. SUMMUM will also be part of many more such initiatives going forward. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Cerrejón has been in La Guajira since 1985. What role has the mine played and continues to play in the economy and development of the region?</strong><br>The arrival of Cerrejón in La Guajira opened the path for Colombia to become an important coal supplier in the global energy market. Since beginning of our activities, operating at the highest standards has been our priority, implementing best international practices and following recognized social and environmental standards to manage our impacts. Cerrejón's operations account for 44% of La Guajira's GDP, representing an opportunity to leverage potential growth sectors such as tourism and commerce. Cerrejón works to generate economic, social, environmental, and individual value at the regional and national levels. We employ more than 6,000 people directly, mainly local, and another 7,000 through contractor companies. Since 2002, we have paid USD7.5 billion in taxes and royalties. In 2018 alone, we paid USD739 million to the national government. As a company, we work to be a strategic ally for the progress of La Guajira, allocating time and resources in overcoming the region's main challenges. We are working on broad and sustainable water solutions and health and education programs, aspects that could materially and strategically influence the community's future and well-being. All of the above must be supported in a form of engagement between communities, the government, and the private sector, where each one has different roles and responsibilities than in the past, allowing the transition toward a disruptive and exponential model of development, that could significantly improve the conditions of La Guajira.</p><p><strong>How does Cerrejón lead the way for Colombian mining to be environmentally sustainable?<br></strong>Sustainability cannot merely be an accessory criterion to the operation but our reason of being. For this reason, we work constantly on the creation of environmental and social value to protect and improve the environment, contributing to its sustainability, for which we have adopted best practices and standards in environmental matters, which have allowed us to achieve significant results. In 2018, we allocated more than USD79.8 million on the prevention, mitigation, and compensation of impacts, prioritizing our actions toward the efficient use of water in operation, air quality management, and conservation of biodiversity. Additionally, we have a robust comprehensive environmental management plan (CEMP) that includes more than 1,600 environmental and social obligations, and for which the National Environmental Licensing Authority (ANLA) carries out the respective monitoring and control. Since we started our operation over 30 years ago, we have implemented advanced practices in managing environmental impacts and cutting-edge technology in our operation. We also have adopted standards to prevent, mitigate, and compensate our impacts.</p><p><strong>How has the Cerrejón Foundation impacted the lives of local communities?<br></strong>Our mission is to contribute to the transformations that La Guajira requires for its development. Traditionally, a company addresses social and environmental issues in order to produce; we are proposing the opposite. Cerrejón wants to lead changes that contribute to an equitable development, where society evidences the benefits of our activity in La Guajira and where agreements can be built. With our foundation, we develop social programs focused on the protection of watersheds, and water access solutions for communities, the strengthening of community and institutional capabilities, and the development of strategic projects for the department in sectors of potential development such as tourism in order to generate positive impacts for its population. We promote actions aimed at conservation and also water and soil management, which are directed at preserving and restoring regional micro-basins. This approach includes conservation projects for the watersheds of the Bruno, Pupurema, El Pasito, Majagüita, and Paladines creeks, providing social and economic benefits and promoting their sustainability. In 2018, we invested USD7.9 million in our social programs. Likewise, we have contributed to the education of 8,000 young people, mainly Guajirans, with the intention of strengthening their skills, so they may return to their territory to contribute with the necessary improvements. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>How is Colombia's electricity generation diversifying to reduce variability and meet higher demand?<br></strong>Colombia has initiated a path toward an energy transition. We will diversify, complement, and improve the competitiveness of our energy grid, promoting unconventional sources of renewable energy. About 70% of the energy produced in our country comes from water sources. This has led to an energy matrix considered the sixth cleanest in the world by the World Economic Council. However, this also makes Colombia's power generation system vulnerable to climate variability, which is why it is essential to diversify. This government will promote the full potential of alternative renewable sources. In the Caribbean region, there is a unique opportunity: the wind in La Guajira blows at a rate double the global average, and that region also has one of the highest luminosities in the world. The potential of wind and solar resources in this region is greater than the hydroelectric potential of the whole country. However, all this potential has yet to be developed. The goal of the government of President Duque is to go from 50MW to at least 1,500MW of installed capacity in unconventional sources of renewable energy, which represents estimated investments between USD1.3 and USD1.8 billion and an approximate reduction of 2 million tons of CO2, equivalent to the planting of 6 million trees.</p><p><strong>Which segments of non-energy mining see the largest investment and present greater opportunities in the medium term?<br></strong>Colombia currently counts over 1 million tons of proven reserves of copper, and we estimate this number to rise to 2 million by 2030, which would make Colombia the third-largest copper producer in Latin America. Our goal is to have at least two copper projects in advanced exploration stage in 2022. However, in our strategic plan for the mining sector, we have set the goal of enhancing gold production. Our goal is to move from 21 tons of gold to 27 tons produced by mining owners. For this, we have an active inter-institutional agenda that includes the financing of environmental authorities with resources from royalties generated by the mining-energy sector, as well as a roadmap between the National Mining Agency and the National Environmental Licenses Authority for the exchange of geographic information and responsive procedures between the two entities.</p><p><strong>What will be the role of the mining economy in the post-conflict era?<br></strong>As a result of the production of hydrocarbons and mining, the regions will receive COP24.2 billion (USD7.799 million) from the Biennial Budget of Royalties for 2019 and 2020. This is the highest amount since the creation of the General Royalty System in 2012. The regions will receive COP30 billion (USD10 billion), if we take into account the COP6 billion that has not yet been executed from previous periods. These resources will finance works in the departments and municipalities, as well as education, science, technology, and innovation, and the stabilization of the areas affected by violence. Resources for post-conflict areas will increase from COP511 million to COP1.9 billion, almost four times the value of the previous biennium. To conserve this source of revenue, it is essential to continue to bet on the mining and energy sector and increase the current reserves of oil and gas, which are 5.7 years and 11.7 years, respectively. Self-sufficiency in hydrocarbons will not only guarantee the energy security of the country but also continue to provide resources for peace, equity, and the development of the regions. Finally, our goal is to bring electricity to 100,000 families who do not have access today. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>To what do you attribute the remarkable success of 2019?<br></strong>The increase in our revenue and production, and the rise of the company to become one of the largest operators in Colombia can be attributed to several factors. First, the increase in oil prices benefited all the actors in the industry. Second, our exploratory success has contributed to an important increase in our production; we made two discoveries in 2017 and two additional ones in 2018, in addition to the continued extension of the Tigana-Jacana play concept in Llanos 34. Our success can also be attributed to our ability to reduce operational costs, successfully test our new discoveries, and manage our surface risks providing special attention to our engagement with stakeholders.</p><p><strong>How has GeoPark's commitment to responsible extraction and taking care of the environment evolved?<br></strong>Our integrated system of values is called SPEED, which stands for safety, people, environment, employees, and development. Based on this, we have a commitment to nature, and our operations are structured around this promise. In Colombia, we have also been certified with ISO 14000. Moreover, we are engaging in environmental investments and trainings as well as participating in studies with local or regional NGOs. We constantly strive to become better and to create programs to achieve and increasingly sustainable operation. For example, we are working on a solar alternative energy project, with the pilot project providing solar energy for one of our fields in 2019. On a larger scale, we are also transitioning from diesel to natural gas, not only for cost reduction but because we are also committed to emissions reduction. In fact, we expect to be certified very soon in product carbon footprint. Other than that, we are reutilizing our water and have so far reduced our water consumption by 40% through reverse osmosis. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the reasons driving Daltile's continuous investments in Mexico?</h4><p>The company was originally established in Monterrey in the 1950s with a focus on the export market. I have been with Daltile for 33 years and have seen how the company has evolved over the years. Mexico has been the cornerstone of our operation for many years. Daltile invested more than USD160 million in plants not only to export from Mexico, but also to meet the needs of the local economy. That is the idea behind our most recent plant in Salamanca, Guanajuato. We manufacture more than 230 million sqft of tile a year and provide direct employment to more than 450 people. 98% of the Salamanca plant's production is destined for the Mexican market. In the last 10 years alone, we have invested USD500 million in Mexico. In total, Daltile relies on 10 plants across the country to produce 550 million sqft of tile per year, of which 50% goes to the US and Canada. The remainder stays in Mexico and South America. In 2010, Daltile had a workforce of 2,500, a number that has increased to 4,000 now. In this context, we have taken advantage of Mexico's skilled labor, though we have also worked to empower and develop our employees and make them feel safe and happy.</p><h4>How does the growth in second-tier cities in Mexico impact the demand for tile?</h4><p>Dynamism in these cities brings dynamism to our business. The ceramic industry has changed significantly as a result of manufacturing technology, allowing us to create designs aligned with consumer preferences around the world as well as the technical requirements of the place in question. Daltile has been able to build a strong distribution network in Mexico; in total, we have more than 600 points of sale. We have seen higher growth, especially in the Bají­o region, with many hotels and buildings under construction, as well as Jalisco and Nuevo León. Moreover, the tourism industry continues to grow at a healthy pace as usual. In this context, growth is expected, but not as dynamic as in 2018. The ceramic industry will grow between 3% and 5%, and Daltile will likely grow at a faster rate to capture greater market share.</p><h4>What are the main export markets for Daltile, and what is the role of quality in reaching further markets?</h4><p>Our mission is to provide quality and service at a fair price. Our designs are subject to strict quality controls, which is why we are able to export extensively to the Canadian and US markets. Specifically, the state of California has extremely stringent requirements. Over the past two years, we have been exploring markets in South America, especially Peru, Colombia, and Chile. Our consumer audit department has played a vital role in making it all happen. It guarantees that ISO and other quality standards are met, and addresses consumer satisfaction.</p><h4>What is your perspective of the future of Mexican economy?</h4><p>Given the uncertainty around tariffs for exports to the US, companies in Mexico need to work to become resilient and be ready for changes. This will allow the overall economy to also become less sensitive to external factors. Constantly working to be a competitive company provides greater flexibility in prices and gives room for action when a potential tariff arises or any other event occurs. Given Mexico's manufacturing capacity, integration with suppliers and customers is extremely important. As for the economy in general, unfortunately, 2019 will not record as much growth as we all would like, and 2020 will be challenging. However, certainty will return. What is important is that we must link the growth of the south with the dynamism of the north. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[growth-in-sight]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main areas of opportunity in the Mexican health industry?</h4><p><span></span><strong>ALEJANDRO MARTÍN </strong>Mayoly Spindler is a French company that specializes in gastroenterology. For us, it is important to develop products that help people to improve their quality of life. We offer medicines and food supplements considering primary care not only in the private system but also in the public system. We are working to introduce our products to the public health system. At present, some of our brands are available in some specific public-sector institutions, such as the military SEDENA and the national oil company, Pemex. Our main clients are in both the public and private sectors. </p><p><span></span><strong>ANTONIO POZOS</strong> The public health system is changing and becoming more centralized. Our products treat irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), diarrhea, constipation reflux and gastritis symptoms, and dyspepsia. Our new probiotics line complements the digestive system.</p><h4>How competitive is the gastroenterology medicine market in Mexico?</h4><p><span></span><strong>AM </strong>There are many players in the market and some of them are focusing on IBS. In order to be diagnosed as a patient with IBS, one needs to see a physician. However, this is a common illness for many people around the world, especially in countries such as Mexico. A global study found that Mexico has the third-highest number of diagnosed IBS patients, after Japan and the US. Stress can be a trigger for symptoms, but not a cause.</p><h4>What areas of opportunities in the market drove the company to incorporate probiotics into its portfolio?</h4><p><span></span><strong>AP </strong>Probiotics are experiencing growth in the market because gastroenterological conditions are common in the country. Nowadays, specifically in Latin America, it is not as common as in Europe, the US, or Canada to use probiotics for different health conditions. However, in Latin America, it is something that is growing and expanding. We began incorporating probiotics into our portfolio in 2009. </p><h4>How does the company plan to incorporate the use of probiotics into Mexican culture?</h4><p><strong>AP</strong> We focus on working directly with physicians. The first step is to provide them with the best information and research. The company shares its knowledge and technology with physicians to motivate them to prescribe our probiotics. Our probiotics are more specialized than others.</p><h4>How were you able to achieve such a high growth number in 2018?</h4><p><span></span><strong>AM </strong>The overall market did not do very well in 2018; however, for our company it was a different story, as we posted 36% growth. We were able to achieve such good results by keeping our business focus limited and strategic. We focused only on key clients: physicians. We made sure our sales representative team gets in touch with them and makes sure they know how to use our products. </p><p><span></span><strong>AP</strong> The company has a base of scientific information that is continuously shared with clients and doctors. Our sales representatives are focused on targeting the correct physicians. Our sales teams are knowledgeable; we have specific training that helps them explain the products. Our representatives can interact with the physicians regarding the science behind the medicines. Something that also helped us is that there are only four or five labs for gastro with a niche portfolio like us.</p><h4><span></span>What strategies are you using to further grow in the next year?</h4><p><strong>AM</strong> We predict 2019 will not be as active as 2018 because the economic situation in the country is uncertain. It is also not sustainable to grow more than 30% every year, so we would be satisfied with a 10% growth. Throughout the company's history in Mexico, it has never suffered a greater loss than the market rate. This is why all our competitors are watching our strategy closely. We are working to expand further in Latin America. The strategy of the company is to find any partnership with a distributor. Once we have a solid presence, we establish an office. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your overall perception of the healthcare industry in Mexico?</h4><p>I am positive about the healthcare industry's future prospects because it has been growing for the past few years. Looking ahead, the new government has mentioned two main priorities. One is to provide true healthcare access to all Mexicans. The second is transparency. As a global company, with high standards in terms of compliance and integrity, we are happy to see the new government prioritizing transparency. The government's agenda is a huge aspiration, and we want to communicate to them that we are here to help.</p><h4>In what ways will Pfizer collaborate to increase access to health services?</h4><p>The new government wants to generate more efficiency and transparency, and the industry has provided ideas and high-level points that could be good strategies to implement. The Secretary of Health has offered working groups to work together; it is imperative to start having those meetings in order to find a solution to achieve our common objective. It is also important that the changes to be implemented should respect the procurement law and all the FTAs with regards to tenders, sanitary regulation, and intellectual property.</p><h4>How is Pfizer preparing itself to meet the future demographic needs of the country?</h4><p>We have a large portfolio that tackles the burden of non-communicable illnesses such as cardiovascular diseases and central nervous system (CNS) diseases in Mexico. Moving forward, we will focus more on different types of diseases, oncology, new antibiotics, vaccines, and treatments for rare diseases. Pfizer is a large company working on many fronts to develop new cures and innovations. Our new CEO has publicly declared that Pfizer is ready to launch 25 new medical breakthroughs until 2025. I will do as much as possible to bring those products to Mexico in the coming years.<br>How many products are being launched in the short to medium term in Mexico?<br>We have been launching an average of three to five products per year over the past three years, and we'd like to keep that as our baseline in the future. It is difficult to say the exact number because it depends on the regulatory process and the approval of the product. We are currently launching new antibiotics. We are also aiming to launch biosimilars focused on inflammation and oncology. Three or four years from now, we also plan to launch new vaccines.</p><h4>What strategies is the company using to compete with new companies?</h4><p>Pfizer is entering a new era, because globally we will not face many patent expirations until 2027. This is partly why Pfizer is expecting a new growth period. Our new CEO is talking about how we can reframe our purpose and establish a purpose-driven agenda. We have always been a company that is focused on patients and their lives, but the new CEO wants to make this vision bigger. This is why we are changing the wording to “breakthroughs," which is not just about new medicine; it is science that truly changes patients' lives.</p><h4>What will the USD8-million investment in the Toluca plant focus on?</h4><p>We have been investing around USD8 million per year in our manufacturing plant to keep it up to date. It is something that we will continue to do. We are investing in new manufacturing lines, as well as new technology for our quality lab. Notably, Pfizer's was the first pharmaceutical plant in Mexico, demonstrating from the very beginning its commitment to the country. The plant is a great source of jobs (500 direct workers) and has an annual production of 44 million products and different certifications that has made it a socially responsible, inclusive, and modern complex for more than 60 years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How has 2018 been for the company?<br></strong>It has been a good year, and the company has experienced double-digit growth in both managed assets, collective investment funds, and trust assets. Our generation of EBITDA also continues to experience double-digit growth, and this is a trend that we have maintained steady over the past five years, which is a huge achievement. On the other hand, it has not been a good year for the industry as due to the country's political situation, the economy has been showing signs of overheating. At present, we feel that the business climate is waking up again. Overall, 2018 has been a good year considering the circumstances. Alianza has taken advantage of a slow year to lay the foundations of transforming its business.</p><p><strong>What do you mean by “laying foundations"?<br></strong>The asset management business in Colombia is a business that is still incipient at a general level. The assets under management of collective investment funds in Colombia represent around 9% of GDP, while in developed countries it exceeds 50%. This means that the evolution of the channels of attention we use to reach our customers, the way in which we relate to them through digital means, and the type of value on offer are things that have to change. They have to change in an accelerated way for collective investment funds to grow exponentially, growing the appetite of our target market. To this end, we are starting a series of transformations within the company, and we are striving to make change constant. According to our analyses, the demands and our customers will multiply in the coming years, and we must be prepared for that.</p><p><strong>How do you evaluate the growth of human capital in Colombia's financial sector?<br></strong>Colombia has great human capital. The competitive advantage we have compared to other Latin American markets is the quality of people who work in Colombia. The Colombian labor market is still global, so there are people in our investment tables who have had experience in JP Morgan in New York as well as experiences in large consultancies in Chile, Brazil, and Mexico. Human capital is just as globalized as the supply of products and demand; therefore, retaining human capital is a growing challenge. </p><p><strong>What is the profile of companies that come to Alianza for their financial needs?<br></strong>We have a profile of companies that range from large multinationals to whom we provide investment services, cash management, foreign trade, to small local companies for whom we provide the same range of services but modulated in terms of what type of operations are carried out. The interesting thing is that all modern companies are consuming the same services and have been driven by the evolution of competition and regulation, which is why the same range of services are consumed regardless of the size of the client.</p><p><strong>How has Alianza evolved with respect to technology?<br></strong>According to our vision, the digital world will handle 90% of the relationship with the client in the next five years. What we are doing is investing significant capital to carry out a project that will allow Alianza to lead the market in the next two to three years. </p><p><strong>What can we expect from Alianza in 2019 and the following years?<br></strong>Sustained growth based on an excellent offer of value for our clients in the different lines we operate, and an improvement in the digital offer for our entire range of clients. If we aim to double the size of the business between 2018 and 2023, similar to what we did between 2014 and 2018, Alianza has to be at the top of the table. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Why do international giants like BMI choose Colombia as the next step in their expansion? <br></strong>BMI chose Colombia because it was looking for a market that has opportunity to grow. The Colombian market has a lot of potential in life and health products where BMI is focused, so this is a major opportunity for us to develop. Individual penetration in Colombia is low; hence, we believe we have great opportunity to make an important impact. </p><p><strong>What lead to the decision to start a new company instead of acquiring something existing? <br></strong>The process of acquiring businesses in Colombia is difficult and competitive. We chose to start a new company because that way we will have control from the start. The company has made it clear that we also do not want to develop any other business lines; we want to keep our focus on life and health insurance.</p><p><strong>What is BMI going to bring to this market?<br></strong>We bring the experience of more than 45 years in the Latin American market. We are leaders in Ecuador and developing markets like Costa Rica and Guatemala. We have many opportunities and characteristics in those markets that we bring to Colombia. We can leverage the capacities that we have in other markets by bringing them here. </p><p><strong>What is your strategy to capture a market share in the market segment that BMI is targeting?<br></strong>We are working on three strategies in the short term. First, we have to do a lot to position the brand in the Colombian market as a personal insurance company. Second, we need to develop an independent sales force with specialized training and excellent incentives. We are working to develop the right tools based in technology to support their business. We believe agents are fundamental to BMI's strategy. Third, we need to design products that cater to the customer's needs. The base is going to be the segments. The concept of the family and life products must be maintained and updated to take them to mass market. We have to focus on that and on the marketing strategies for the company. </p><p><strong>What are some of the specific needs in Colombia? <br></strong>We have to analyze and adapt to the local market our main strategies but in general the structures are the same as we have been working in each local market as Ecuador, Costa Rica, and Guatemala, for example. We have developed efficient processes and have to bring the best practices there and apply to Colombia. </p><p><strong>How does BMI plan to attract and develop the best human capital? <br></strong>We need to work to attract and develop the best employees and best sales force. We are focused on developing the different skills of the people, as well as customer service and efficient processes as our promise of value. On the other hand, we have an independent sales force that works for multiple companies in the market. We have to develop those strategies and tools so that they choose our company over other companies. The training, incentives that we built for them dictate if they will choose you or not. But the main strategy is to focus on service. In order to be successful, a company has to develop the best service and processes as well as technology and incentives. At the same time, it is important to train salespeople regarding what differentiates BMI and our value proposition.</p><p><strong>What can we expect from BMI Colombia in 2019 and beyond? <br></strong>I have a clear objective, to get the company to be recognized in 2019 as the specialized company in personal insurance. Whenever there is a necessity to purchase a personal policy such as health and life, we hope BMI is the answer. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>In recent years, Scotiabank has invested significantly in Latin America. How does Colombia feature in the regions for the bank?<br></strong>Scotiabank has as a strategic priority of investment in the countries within the Pacific Alliance. The strategic goal is to be an important bank in each of the countries that are part of that pact. Also, we have an open innovation strategy in which we have relations with fintechs to improve our innovation process and have some partners to do that. We have a focus on the technological investment and thus we have digital factories in Colombia and each of the capitals of the Pacific Alliance. We already have 280 people working on that having commenced two years ago. In addition, we have created a service hub in Colombia to support worldwide services like the call center. </p><p><strong>You acquired Citi's operations in Colombia. How has that affected your customer portfolio?<br></strong>That was an important acquisition because Citi has affluent clients. Besides, we use and synergize our capabilities from Colpatria to increase customer centricity, one of the characteristics that differentiated Citi from its competitors. Hence, our goal is to synergize and maximize on all the capabilities we acquired.</p><p><strong>What ratio of your portfolio are corporate clients?<br></strong>They represent a third of our customers right now. The intention is to continue leveraging all the capabilities that Scotiabank has worldwide to increase our wallet share among those customers. We are a significant player in this area. We built all the capabilities to integrally serve such customers, not only in lending, but also with cash management products and the entire portfolio. </p><p><strong>What is your organic growth strategy to identify new customers in Colombia?<br></strong>We have a value-added offer thanks to Colpatria and Scotiabank. We renamed the brand Scotiabank Colpatria. This merges capabilities from both sides and allows us to provide value-added services to our clients. </p><p><strong>What is the need for an integrated banking service in Colombia?<br></strong>Our main priority is to invest in all technological needs to support this integral offer. We are leveraging the size of our Canadian book to serve large clients in the country. We are investing in technology to improve our digital services and platform. </p><p><strong>What sectors offer the best opportunities for Colpatria?<br></strong>We have many clients across a diversity of sectors on the corporate side. We are well received in the power and energy sector, with companies like ISA and Ecopetrol. And for other large Colombian local companies keen to grow in the region, we are an excellent partner. </p><p><strong>What can we expect of the company in the near future?<br></strong>We expect to continue growing in the country. We are the fifth bank locally by market share, and we expect to reach a 10% market share next year. Once the acquisition of Citi is completely implemented, we will evaluate the possible purchase of another company. We are targeting to be a 100% digital bank for 2020. For that reason, we will continue in our strategy to improve the customer experience in our digital channels and in our offices. It is also worthy to highlight that we are offering products with no fee. We want to have a more inclusive and democratic banking system in the country. With this type of products, we expect to dynamize the Colombian economy by including people in the system and to expand our costumer's portfolio in the retail market. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What contributed to the company's successful year in 2018?<br></strong>2018 was a year of certain economic difficulties for the country. Despite that, we were able to grow in our commercial and business areas. We consolidated ourselves as the second bank in the country in terms of portfolio. That was also triggered by greater efficiency in banking processes. Our results were successful, and yet the key achievement concerns the digital transformation of the bank.</p><p><strong>How have you managed to achieve such high levels of penetration for your digital services?<br></strong>We launched our digital platform DaviPlata six years ago. Through it, we have been able to perform well, and, as a result, the bank ranks among the key players to boost financial inclusion across Colombia. Today, the platform provides many services for clients that they can also find at a regular bank. Every Colombian who has a mobile phone and an ID card can use this platform at zero cost. We have launched this platform in El Salvador, and are also planning to do so in Costa Rica, Panama and Honduras. We are well into the process of transformation all the bank into a 100% online financial institution. For example, today we can offer loans through our digital platforms in under five minutes. Nearly 70% of our clients are digital, and we expect to include additional services for retail customers. In June, we aim to launch many more online processes for investment banking. Through this strategy, we expect to reach more customers and make processes more efficient. Our goal is to be an institution that offers more than financial services. Our clients do not want a mortgage; they want a home, and we need to offer the right services enabling them to fulfill their wishes. For example, companies do not want loans, but to sell more. So, using that example, we must become a partner for them, facilitating the achievement of those targets. </p><p><strong>You are set to partner Rappi and other companies in offering digital financial services. What makes Davivienda the right partner of choice for this endeavor?</strong><br>We are about to announce a partnership with Rappi, which will be crucial in that the firm is known as the Colombian unicorn, enjoying a strong international presence. With this partnership we expect to surprise our clients. DaviPlata is a platform with 5 million customers, who have the opportunity to purchase goods anywhere. It is on that platform that we create alliances, one of which will be with Rappi. We intend to establish additional partnerships with others by leveraging this platform. </p><p><strong>What role do the Central American countries play in Davivienda's portfolio?<br></strong>The banks in Central America represent 25% of our business. It varies from country to country, but we are not the most important player in the region unlike other Colombian financial institutions. Our rivals there are achieving fantastic profits. Ours is good, too, but as yet continues to lag, and our strategy is to offer digital products that differentiate us in Central America, a market of significant potential.</p><p><strong>New international players have entered Colombia. How has that affected the sector, and what steps have you taken to remain competitive?</strong> <br>Certain new players have come from across the region, while others have left, as was the case with Citi. These players have been important in prompting us to improve in many areas, such us financial inclusion, or risk management, for example, thereby rendering the sector more competitive. Davivieda must play a major role in the sector's changes. Indeed, we must play the lead role in this field. To do that, we must reinvent ourselves to offer added value and ensure sustainability. Colombia is an attractive country for international investors, especially since the peace agreement. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How will the new fiscal reform advances by the government change Colombia's prospects as an investment destination?<br></strong>The Financing Law is a substantial effort to reduce the effective corporate tax rate to boost investment and short- and medium-term economic growth. The strategy centers on reducing the effective corporate tax rate from 67.9% in 2018 to 50.4% in 2022. The main measures to meet this objective include a gradual reduction of corporate income tax rate from 33% to 30% in 2022; VAT paid on the acquisition, import, or creation of fixed assets may be treated as a credit for income tax purposes; 50% of the industry and commerce tax effectively paid will be deductible if it is directly related to the taxpayer's income-producing activity; and a reduction of the presumptive income tax rate from the current 3.5% to 1.5% in 2019 and 0% by 2020. Meanwhile, the withholding tax rate for portfolio investment will fall from 14% to 5%. This is part of the comprehensive economic strategy to promote foreign investment and the deepening of the Colombian financial market. The reform aims to promotes competitiveness by reducing income tax tariffs for corporations in an effort to increase formal employment and boost the economy.</p><p><strong>The ministry's growth projections for 2019 stand at 3.6%, a full percentage point higher than 2018. To what factors does the ministry attribute such a notable increase in growth?</strong><br>The Ministry of Finance expects economic growth to be driven by several main factors: higher investment due to the Financing Law, better perspectives for internal demand growth, and solid institutional framework. The fiscal package implemented a group of measures that will boost economic growth. The Financing Law will create more firms and motivate current enterprises to bring more jobs with better benefits, while expanding private gross capital formation and economic activity in general. Second, we expect private consumption to accelerate in 2019. This will emerge as a consequence of the convergence of annual inflation to the Central Bank's center target, increased consumer and business confidence that has been recovering in recent periods, and the expansion of real credit. With investment and consumption growing at a higher pace, domestic demand will increase by approximately 4% by the end of 2018. </p><p><strong>What major structural issues affecting the economy does the ministry plan to address through policy in the coming years?<br></strong>One important challenge that has to be addressed is the Venezuelan crisis. The combination of an economic slump in the neighboring country affects Colombia negatively via weaker external demand and higher fiscal costs associated to migration flows. Meanwhile, Colombia remains on the frontlines, responding to the severe humanitarian emergency in Venezuela. Remarkably, more than 1 million migrants from Venezuela currently reside in Colombia, and many more have either transited through the country or crossed the border temporarily. Colombia has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to provide humanitarian support such as healthcare, education, as well as granting labor rights to migrants to help integrate them into the economy. The associated fiscal costs are estimated to be around 0.5% of GDP in the near term. In addition to the migration issue, we highlight the importance of increasing the total factor productivity to narrow the negative output gap. A scenario of strong economic recovery in Venezuela, a lower tax burden for corporates from the Financing Law, and a more efficient public spending will foster productivity as well as medium and long-term economic growth. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What made Itaú choose Colombia for expansion?<br></strong>We had a proposal for Latin America, and Itaú aims to be the most important Latin American bank, supporting regional companies and investors looking to expand as well as global companies who are planning to enter Latin America. Any company with an aim to target Latin America must include Colombia in its strategy, not only because of its relevance in the region but also because the country has a population of 50 million people. Moreover, Colombia has dealt successfully with inflation and the drop-in oil prices. Particularly, Colombia has never defaulted on its debt. According to my knowledge, Colombia recorded negative GDP growth only once during the last 15 years. With these facts in mind, it would be wrong to claim that we are a Latin American bank if we didn't operate in Colombia. Itaú's Colombia operations were established here six years ago with a small second floor wholesale bank with the objective of understanding the country. We waited for the opportunity to have a full-scale bank here, which arrived in 2016 when Itaú merged with CorpGroup in Chile. CorpGroup owned two banks: Helm Bank and CorpBanca. </p><p><strong>What is the importance of the Itaú brand for your business model and specifically when entering new markets?<br></strong>Talking about institutional investors, the brand of Itaú is extremely important. Once we integrated the brand Itaú in our branches, the regulator was clear that Itaú has a long-term view of Colombia. When talking about retail, we represent 30% of the value of the Itaú brand in Colombia while the other 70% will depend on the quality and value proposition we are creating for Colombia. It is easy to say that you have to be customer centric, but it is hard to implement. A company has to be creative and experiment with all sorts of operations, from small tasks to digital strategy, while keeping the clients' needs in mind throughout the entire process. </p><p><strong>What is the competitive advantage that Itaú can offer its customers?<br></strong>First, Itaú has an organized way to work—one that focuses on setting a different value proposition for our three segments. Our aim is to not be the cheapest bank in the market, but I believe that it is possible to have the most competitive value proposition, so that our offer for one client with the service quality of digital solution can be the best value offer in Colombia. Itaú employs the same technology in Brazil, and while it is applying the same model here, the solution needs to consider the needs of the Colombian market. </p><p><strong>What unique challenges did Itaú find in the Colombian market?<br></strong>Colombia has a highly organized financial market with strong players, thus presenting tough competition. We had to deal with a tough market during the integration process; it wasn't a part of our plan, but we are succeeding in our efforts. It is better to work on organizing a company's operations in a new market when the market is not so strong because there are less opportunities to lose. At present, looking at the non-performing loans related to the retail market, I think that the market is at an inflection point.</p><p><strong>What can we expect from Itaú in Colombia in the coming years?<br></strong>We have an organized plan and a vision that we want to be the best retail bank in Colombia. If an interested investor comes to Colombia and a consulting firm wants to present a successful story about a bank that expanded to Colombia, Itaú will be the reference. Our vision is to maintain that image of Itaú. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role did Ecuador's open skies policy play in Plus Ultra's decision to open the Madrid-Guayaquil route via Quito?</h4><p>The policy of open skies adopted by the government has attracted the interest of several international airlines, especially from Anglo-Saxon companies, to come to Ecuador because it has a great deal to offer and has untapped potential. Ecuador is the country of the “four worlds.“ The policy of open skies was a central piece behind the decision of several airlines, including Plus Ultra, to bet on Ecuador. Apart from the capacity of Ecuador to attract visitors, we need to bear in mind Ecuador has a population of 17 million, so the outbound capacity of the country is also attractive for airlines. With our new route, Plus Ultra is now a player driving tourists into Ecuador and positioning Spain in our country. Our motto says we will bring the best of Spain to Ecuador and the best of Ecuador to Spain. We will operate this route three times a week with an Airbus A340 300 with a capacity of 303 passengers.</p><h4>What is Plus Ultra's strategy to position its route and differentiate itself from other operators?</h4><p>Indeed, we will compete in this route against other airlines. However, we have an important differentiating value, which is the passenger service. Plus Ultra seeks to put passenger service back at the core of an airline's service, not only from the commercial side, but also onboard, in the airport, and during post-sale services. Additionally, we will offer the most competitive flight from Ecuador to Spain, and the flight includes one suitcase for free and up to three pieces of luggage in economy class. In addition, in business class, our seats are flat beds, which guarantee a superior comfort level. Our inaugural flight was on July 12, and we were extremely pleased it was an almost full flight and spaces are quickly filling up. In addition, we are the closest Spanish airline to Latin America. We know well the region and its characteristics, the people and also the distributors. Therefore, will work closely with wholesalers in Ecuador to make sure distribution is done through effective channels. We had 10,000 bookings just in the first two months of commercialization.</p><h4>What will be the impact on Ecuador's outbound capacity if nationals are exempted from visa requirements to enter the EU?</h4><p>One of the factors limiting growth at this time is the requirement of a Schengen visa for Ecuadorians to visit Europe. We are confident the outbound market will see considerable growth if the visa requirements are lifted. After the open skies policy, relaxed visa requirements for Ecuadorians would be the next step to guarantee the viability or expansion of new routes and the arrival of other airlines.</p><h4>How is Plus Ultra positioned to not only capitalize on potential Spanish tourists to Ecuador, but also European?</h4><p>At present, we are consolidating the Spain-Ecuador route, though we are quickly moving to sign strategic alliances with other airlines to promote the connection to Ecuador via Spain to the rest of Europe. In this regard, we will benefit from getting the IOSA certification, which will allow us to form alliances worldwide with other airlines. Besides, the Ministry of Tourism of Ecuador's promotion plans are proving to be effective and provide for close cooperation with airlines.</p><h4>What are the objectives for the route over its first year operating?</h4><p>We hope that with all the strategic alliances and the communication plan in place, we will be able to increase the frequency to at least six flights weekly by 2020, and to in order to achieve this objective, a new 340 600 airplane will cover the route. Plus Ultra not only seeks to grow in routes, but also in frequencies. Apart from that, despite being a young airline, Plus Ultra has ambitious plans to become an airline of choice, connecting Spain to Andean countries. We will open a route with Colombia, adding to our flights to Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, and Peru.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Decarbonization Roadmap]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[jose-vicente-mozos-president-asociacion-espanola-fabricantes-automoviles-camiones-anfac]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The automobile sector is in a transition process due to the increase in demand for electric cars. What strategy is ANFAC following to ensure that this transition is as smooth as possible?</h4><p>The automotive industry is committed to the decarbonization objectives of the EU, which is why we are continuously working to ensure that the transition to zero emission vehicles is as orderly and efficient as possible. It is essential that the consumer understands that the purchase of a new vehicle is a safe bet for the future. We need to establish a framework that gives them confidence in their purchase. We need these messages of confidence to come through a government plan to encourage the renewal of the car fleet. We also need the standardization of transportation policies throughout the country. It is also a priority to carry out industrial reforms that promote the competitiveness of factories in Spain.</p><h4>The change of regulation at the national and European level is affecting the sector. This month ANFAC has asked the government to reduce VAT on electric cars. What is ANFAC's relationship with the government, and what other measures should be taken to improve the efficiency of the sector in the medium-long term?</h4><p>ANFAC is committed to the development of the automotive industry in Spain. We have worked and will continue to work alongside the government to achieve an orderly transition to the transportation modes of the future. We have an easy relationship with all the ministries. The Ministry of Industry and its minister, Reyes Maroto, have been a high-level partner with whom we hope to progress further. As I have already mentioned, stability in the administration is fundamental for investment security. The help of the administration is essential in terms of incorporating new technologies and supporting R&amp;D in production processes. We need to focus on both Spanish factories that are strong and segments where investment should increase. Any innovation that can be developed in the automobile sector can be applied to other sectors and small businesses. Furthermore, it is necessary for concrete measures to be carried out by the administration. Those measures include subsidies and reduced taxes for alternative vehicles, as well as a unified tax scheme for all autonomous communities that take into account environmental criteria and decarbonization goals. These reforms will promote the renewal of the vehicle fleet. It is also important to design a national strategy for the implementation and development of recharging infrastructure. These infrastructures can be slow, for public parking, or fast, for example, on intercity roads.</p><h4>One of the main challenges today is the decrease in production. Spanish factories have registered a 5.5% drop in production between January and April 2019. What are the factors that contribute to this decrease?</h4><p>There is uncertainty, not only in Spain but throughout Europe, regarding the future of the automotive industry. It is undergoing change because of the international trade environment, where protectionism is on the rise. Protectionism is happening alongside particular economic crises, as happened in Turkey last year. Spain is seeing a cut in its production, of course, but Spain is not alone. Markets in Europe are reducing their production and their orders in recent months, which is the cause for a reduction in orders sent to Spanish factories.  </p><h4>What are the main objectives and priorities of ANFAC for 2020? </h4><p>It is necessary to define a common roadmap for decarbonization. We need a strategy with real solutions, including plans to help alternative vehicles, taxation with environmental criteria, and reduced taxes for alternative vehicles. We must follow the examples of other EU countries that are passing legislation across their entire territory, adopting important accompanying measures for the development of their automotive sectors.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[house-hunters]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your outlook for demand for houses and apartments in Mexico City?</h4><p>There is a great demand for housing in Mexico City. The problem is the housing policies that limit the capacity of the industry to attend the demand needs; so the offerings are much lower than the demand. This means house prices are always going up, particularly in central areas. Mobility in Mexico City is extremely complicated, so housing in central areas are in high demand. The industry does not have the capacity to produce enough housing to meet demand, and this is an issue the government needs to solve. We need to reuse large plots of land so developers can develop megaprojects with many units to address this demand. Another factor that impacts the industry is that all new projects are being put on hold while the new administration reviews everything done under the previous administration. This has stopped new projects from flowing, and permits are difficult to get processed; however, the demand and need for housing means it is just a matter of time before things start to move forward. Nevertheless, we see Mexico City as a strong market with great potential to continue growing.</p><h4>Mexico City requires 50,000 new houses a year to meet demand, but only 15,000 are being built. Is the city realistically able to develop that number of houses?</h4><p>It is extremely difficult to develop a project, and there are not many housing projects taking place. There is land, though we do not have the right land usage rights, so in many areas we lack the housing density the city requires. For example, one might only be permitted to build four or five houses on a plot that could potentially take 15-20 units. The government needs to address this urban planning issue. Other cites globally tend to be more densely developed than Mexico City—they build higher and with smaller units. That is something that Mexico City needs to incorporate in some way. The infrastructure and utility services also need to be improved so more people can be accommodated on a single piece of land.</p><h4>How much land does FICADE currently own in Mexico City?</h4><p>When we acquire land, we start developing it straightaway. We do not have any land in reserve. Having land reserves works well in the provinces, where things need to be organized, like bringing in infrastructure before one can develop. In Mexico City, it is difficult to have land reserves because land is so expensive, and there is no need to wait to develop it. </p><h4>What is your opinion of the trend of building urban housing developments for rent and not for sale?</h4><p>Rental units have great potential. This trend is becoming more professionalized in Mexico City. Currently, we have a large secondary or informal rental housing market here, and we need to develop a more institutionalized product and mechanisms for renting, such as a legal framework. It is more common for millennials and others who want to have less debt to rent rather than buy. This is definitely a great opportunity in Mexico City and globally. However, it is more akin to being in the office space segment, where one owns and maintains the building they lease. FICADE is into the buying and selling model currently. We will enter the office and rental market in perhaps four or five years' time. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[virtual-real-estate]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the motivation and reasons behind the creation of Redus?</h4><p>Redus is a result of an issue we faced as entrepreneurs. A few years ago, we needed to find land to develop a building, the search process was difficult and time consuming. As for technology, we did not find the support we needed to find a solution. For example, the contacts on the ad pages were not answering the phone or they showed something online that was physically completely different. A large majority of the advertised properties online are frauds and can put investment at risk. Being in the real estate market is a great responsibility because buyers invest their wealth and savings into it. Real estate is often a once-in-a-lifetime purchase. We wanted to develop a platform in the market that could offer a safe space to conduct these investments. Another thing that we noticed is that real estate brokers in Mexico do not require a title or a license to operate. At Redus, the people who are part of our team of real estate brokers, with or without previous experience, have all the tools to give the best service to our clients. We train our Representatives via online tutorials on the different topics and trends in the industry. We mix two of the most important businesses in the world: technology and real estate. Redus is the safest platform for buying, selling, and renting real estate. Anyone who is looking for a property to buy or rent can find it through us with all the security guarantees of a certified property. </p><h4>What verification process does the company use to prevent fraud?</h4><p>We have a strong team of attorneys who review each property. All advertised properties on our website are supervised by a team of lawyers that has already ensured all the papers are in order and that it is not a fraud. We rely on Mexican law. We certify each property according to what is required for the deed. The most important factor is knowing that the person offering the property has the real intention and means of selling it. People offer their property and put it up for sale without realizing that maybe they cannot sell it. It makes a client wonder why it is even for sale in the first place if it cannot be sold. We want to avoid these situations in the real estate market. At Redus, we aim to be the bridge between the buyer and the seller. The company's headquarters are in Mexico City, where we have the strongest presence, but we are present all around the country.</p><h4>What role does Redus strive to have within the Mexican economy in the long term?</h4><p>We are starting with real estate but Redus is a platform that connects buyers and sellers and ensures a safe transaction through technology. In the future, we see Redus selling practically any product that a buyer and a seller wants. We call ourselves Redus and not “Real Estate.com." Taking as an example Amazon, the world largest e-commerce platform. Amazon started by selling only books, if Jeff Bezos had named Amazon "Books.com," Amazon would not be the most successful platform in the world. In the future, Redus will be able to carry out any purchase-sale transaction. We believe that technology has no limits, and Redus is the living proof of that. In the short and medium term, we are focused 100% on the real estate sale but we have strong technological infrastructure that in the future could give life to a platform where you can sell or buy any product digitally. œ–</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<intervieweelist0description><![CDATA[Born in 1963 in Conegliano (Italy), Sandro Bottega grew up in a family closely linked to the world of grappa and wine. He began managing his late father’s distillery at the age of 19, supported by his siblings Barbara and Stefano. 
Over the years, he has flanked the distillation of grappa with the production of a wide range of sparkling wines — including Prosecco -, of great red wines from Valpolicella and Tuscany, of Limoncino and other liqueurs. The basic principles Sandro holds fundamental are simple: creativity, quality, and flavor are inextricably linked, discovery is a never-ending process, and imaginative presentation is absolutely essential. Bottega is a family company located in Bibano, Treviso (45 km North of Venice) that produces and distributes typical Italian premium quality beverages and food products to over 120 countries worldwide.]]></intervieweelist0description>

		<url><![CDATA[sandro-bottega-president-ceo-bottega-spa]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main milestones of the company since its inception in 1977?</h4><p>We have been working at the highest levels of quality, design, and sustainability, which are our company's values. This allowed us to create state-of-the-art products that are highly innovative. We have always been a step ahead of the others, and this has paid off. The strength of this company is not in the financial numbers but in the name and brand awareness globally, because everybody recognizes Bottega as a master of quality, design, innovation, and sustainability.</p><h4>What strategies have been implemented for Bottega to become the second-best selling sparkling wine in travel-retail?</h4><p>The strategy has been to look at market needs. We do not focus on the mass market but on niche markets. Our products are available in the most important department stores of the world, and we have a distribution in about 300 airports around the world, 60 airlines, and the best wine shops globally. This allows the consumer of the Italian style, of the dolce vita, namely those who want to drink and live well, to find our products in the best locations where we are present with a beautiful display.</p><h4>What is the idea behind Bottega Prosecco Bars?</h4><p>The mission of a company is to produce and earn profits as well as have social responsibility and help consumers improve the quality of their lives. This for Bottega has been a must since day one. Teaching consumers how to recognize the quality of a product has always been extremely important, and for this we opened the Prosecco Bar, where we show the consumer how to enjoy life. We know what people want not only in terms of wine but also food. We also bring a design capability; the design we provide is the one that consumers want. We are in a more relaxed atmosphere where one can eat something in a homemade style and where they can spend their time in a way that they do not have to pay attention to what they say or how they eat.</p><h4>What makes Bottega unique in such a competitive wine market?</h4><p>Apart from quality, design, and sustainability, we have always managed the company with a concept of efficiency. The value of our products is extremely fitting if we compare and consider the above three elements. One can find wines that are cheaper; however, the level of quality that we provide is much higher than the price one pays for.</p><h4>What is the relationship between technology and sustainability for Bottega?</h4><p>When setting up a company, one has to manage it by having a vision for the future in order to ensure everyone's well-being. Normally, it takes a liter of water to make one bottle of wine. Our prosecco is cultivated without using any water, so the one we use is only for the bottling system. Our system allows us to recycle about 20,000 liters per day, which means that the use of water is about 300ml per bottle, one third of the average. We use geothermal energy by pumping water from the soil and injecting it into the system, so we reduce our energy consumption, saving 756 tons of CO2 per year. On our golden bottle, we use a water-based coating. 50% of the glass that we use in our bottles comes from a recycled system. We always use technology to improve our concepts. Automation is one of the major changes in the world for cultivation of vineyards. Our consultant developed insects that are predators that allow us to protect the vineyards in a natural way. All these things together make the technology important and fit perfectly with the principles and rules that we strive for in our company.</p><h4>What is the approach of Bottega to wine tourism?</h4><p>Bottega welcomes visitors at all estates: in Treviso, in Valgatara (Valpolicella) and Montalcino. We offer free visits and we can arrange tasting as well as short lessons about the wines. We have created some beautiful locations where the people can visit the vineyards and walk in them, and we think we should do more in terms of promotion. For example, a few years ago we made a promotion with British Airways and with Sligro in which we invited all consumers who were buying our products to keep the cork, which entitled them to a free visit and tasting at our premises.</p><h4>The Conegliano-Valdobbiadene Prosecco hills were awarded the UNESCO World Heritage status. How will this impact Veneto, and how will Bottega capitalize on this?</h4><p>Veneto is the region in Italy that offers more than any other. What you can find here is absolutely unique: architecture, from Palladio's villas to Venice; nature, from the Dolomites to the beautiful hills to the countryside to the beaches; historical sites; and high-quality restaurants. The World Heritage status will increase the number of visitors and I hope the level of services and the number of restaurants and hotels. In our locations, we will welcome guests that want to buy or experience our wines. We receive about 2,000 visitors every year, which is small compared to what we have. We hope that this will bring them a better feeling of what Prosecco is.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2020?</h4><p>My strategy has always been to grow between 5 and 10% YoY, and this is what I want to continue to achieve. I am not looking to double the turnover or to have a huge increase. In 2020, I expect to achieve normal results, though always in line with our strategy to be more known to the number of people with the ambition to live better.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What does Varichem offer to key players in Colombia's energy sector? </strong></p><p>We are a company with 22 years in the industry, during which time we have developed a series of divisions, one of which is consulting. We are responsible for developing and updating emergency plans, contingency and risk management, and providing the basis of action in times of emergency that can result from an oil spill, which is our specialty. We work with the entire oil industry, which has clear policies and a defined social and environmental responsibility, whereby a good contingency plan is vital. As an expert in emergency care and clean technologies, we have been developing such technologies to offer the oil industry options, although they are not the cheapest solutions. Companies should have more specific and higher compliance levels at the environmental level in order to optimally close the cycle. We must look for a balance of green technology, and learn to develop it, with companies adapting their environmental policy to commercial practices. The areas where exploitation already exists have already suffered the initial impact, although the natural resilience of the environment allows for a return to the original state. Today, we see that in many of these areas, improvement programs can be implemented to reduce that existing impact. We must act on lessons learned and close the circle of repeatedly damaging the environment. We are convinced that clean water treatment plants can recycle effectively. The issue of oily residues is covered by clear rules for compliance and security. We strive to incorporate innovations arising worldwide to reduce environmental liabilities and environmental impact, achieving the right balance. We are optimistic about 2019, as companies here completed their restructuring processes in 2017 and 2018.  We believe that 2019 will be a year of reactivation, new challenges, and developments.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Jeddah Islamic Port]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[farooq-shaikh-ceo-logipoint]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How can automotive players benefit from the facilities you offer at Jeddah Islamic Port? And how can the private sector help raise the competitiveness of the logistics industry on the western coast?</h4><p>Automotive industry has been using the LogiPoint facilities for many years now and we have been a part of the supply chain of almost all the automobile brands being imported in the Kingdom. Automakers lease our yards and store their vehicles here free of VAT and customs duties until they are finally sold and delivered, which is when the VAT and customs duties are paid. LogiPoint also offers an excellent option to automobile-makers, who have more than one representatives in the Kingdom, to maintain their inventory here in the Jeddah Islamic Port under their own control and dispatch units to their clients not only in the Kingdom, but to other clients in the region as well. The Private sector has to actively play its part in realizing the objectives set forth by the Government in the Vision 2030 plan. We will need to collaborate with and work extensively with all the stakeholders in the Logistics industry including first and foremost the regulatory authorities, the shipping and logistics companies, the freight-forwarding industry, as well as the end-users including traders, manufacturers and retailers. Our perspective is that everything can be pictured as a unified chain. We should not fixate on any one mode of transportation as long as everything is conducted with complete transparency, efficiency, reliability and security. At the end of the day, we are in the business of moving goods; it does not matter whether we do it using sea, land, or air routes.</p><h4>Are Jeddah's logistics solutions sophisticated enough to make it a regional hub?</h4><p>That's a very good question. Sophistication is an ongoing process, and over the past decade we have seen Jeddah emerge as an increasingly sophisticated market vis-í -vis logistics solutions. We have to cover some ground before we can be amongst the world's most sophisticated logistics hubs, but we have two great enabling factors working in our favor — one is the vision and the will of the leadership to transform not just Jeddah but the Kingdom into a sophisticated market, and the other is technology. These two elements act as great accelerators for sophistication in any field. It is then for the Private sector enterprise to leverage the opportunities and break new ground. On the specific question of sophistication, while enabling regulatory measures and investments in infrastructure development are paramount, right now the focus should be on the next phase, which is to optimize the existing assets and infrastructure and to maximize their output. The Jeddah Islamic Port is the logical geographical gateway between the East and the West, lying as it does on one of the world's busiest shipping corridors. However, over the past few decades, other regional hubs have acquired greater sophistication because of which many businesses, including even some of the largest Saudi businesses, have opted to transit their cargoes through them despite the longer transit times involved. That is all now set to change in a big way, as Jeddah takes its rightful place alongside the world's logistics hubs through a commitment to innovation as well as through collaborations with the industry stakeholders. At LogiPoint we pride ourselves at having been at the forefront of the sophistication drive. Today, our clients can terminate East-bound imports from the Western origins in Jeddah Islamic Port, and move them under bond to all destinations within the GCC by road. Our Value Added Services in the Bonded Zone have enabled clients to import goods here, customize them for their respective markets, and serve their clients with just in time deliveries. We are already receiving air imports for import clearance as well as re-export via LogiPoint. More than anything else, we have brought an enabling mindset to the Logistics market of Jeddah, which has opened up a world of opportunities for regional and global trade.</p><h4>How have new technological developments such as Fasah impacted Logipoint's business and the logistics sector in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>The 24-hour customs clearance took us to the same level as the rest of the world. Customers' first priority has never been time, but rather transparency and certainty, because planning a supply chain for your business requires knowing a lot of details about inspections and rates in advance; however, the current decline in business volumes has led us to think of alternative solutions: shipping a container from one part of the world to another has never been easier given the present availability of services and all-inclusive solutions in the market. Our customer composition is going to change totally over the next few years in a way that shipping lines will form the largest segment of our customers. Clients are keen to work with a single company that takes care of every step instead of turning to a company for maritime shipping before finding another for customs clearance. As such, big industry players will become even larger and smaller players will start working for large players because they cannot afford the technological transition. At the same time, there are many manufacturers and logistics companies that are beginning to use blockchain-powered tracking technologies, something that all players will need to integrate into their supply chain system within two to three years, particularly as the shipping industry becomes more digitalized by the day.</p><h4>What is required from the Saudi government to kickstart economic activity and promote a viable, competitive business environment?</h4><p>Our economy has been traditionally reliant on oil prices and government investments, but activities in the construction sector can change this situation, given its size. After three years of decline, consumption is on the rise again, which is seen as a positive improvement; however, stronger investments from the private sector are necessary to move away from the current heavy reliance on government spending, a trend that has completely taken off. Having good regulations that encourage competition and private sector participation are both important, but implementing these regulations and people's compliance is of equal importance.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How is the Colombian economy raising its profile for international investors and markets?<br></strong>Colombia continues to be one of the most attractive Latin American countries to invest in, thanks to its democratic, political, and institutional stability. The strength of our economy, the degree of investment granted by risk rating agencies, and the confidence that investors have in the country means the arrival of foreign resources is considerable when compared to other nations of similar development. The country has sound economic and fiscal management and a central bank independent of the government, which ensures responsible decision-making around key indicators such as inflation and interest rates.</p><p><strong>What economic challenges will the new government have to address?<br></strong>There are a number of challenges. The government must reduce the fiscal deficit from 3.1% in 2018 to 2.4% in 2019, according to what is established in the fiscal rule. It is one of the most complex tasks, because the Law of Financing aimed to raise an additional COP14 trillion (USD4.472 billion) to meet the needs established in the 2018 budget, but finally only standards that generate revenues of COP7.1 trillion (USD2.268 billion) were approved. Another challenge is to overcome an economic year that will surely be affected by the regional elections that will take place in the second quarter. 2019 could also be affected by the El Niño phenomenon, despite its moderate intensity. This has substantial consequences not just for the agricultural sector, but also the country's energy grid, which is highly dependent on hydroelectric power. One of the major factors causing uncertainty is the volatility of the prices of oil and other exportable raw materials. Colombia must work hard to promote competitiveness, equity, formalization, and insertion in the fourth industrial revolution. Externally, the storm clouds come from the commercial war between the US and China, Brexit, and the Venezuelan political crisis. The government and the economic policy must increase investor confidence, including taking measures against corruption, insecurity, and legal protection of capital.</p><p><strong>Looking to the future, where should investors and international markets invest in Colombia? What sectors or industries were previously overlooked?</strong><br>Colombia has potential in several sectors, but it is evident that agro-industrial activity represents a great option due to its lag, for international investors, as well as tourism. There are also great possibilities in sectors such as renewable energy and unconventional hydrocarbons.</p><p><strong>What are your expectations for the Colombian economy in the coming years?<br></strong>2019 will be a better year than 2018 for the Colombian economy. GDP would grow between 3.3% and 3.6%. The lower figure comes from the IMF, and the higher figure comes from the Colombian government. Most of the country's indicators are positive. Inflation will continue to be under control, there will be stability in interest rates, exports will continue to rise, several public works will take shape, and sectors such as industry, foreign trade, and tourism will boost the economy. The 6% increase in the minimum wage, which represents an improvement in the purchasing power of households, will stimulate domestic demand, thus slowing down the growing trend of unemployment. Consumer confidence has begun to recover, after the sharp fall generated by the text of the original project of the Financing Law. In foreign trade, exports could grow around 5% in 2019, approaching USD50,000 million; however, everything indicates that the deficit of the trade balance will continue to rise, due to the fact that imports also show an upward trend. 2019 also looks good on the hydrocarbons side, although uncertainty will remain over the evolution of international prices. These prices had a YoY downturn but have begun to recover. They are already above the average of USD65 per barrel, established in the government's financial plan. In general, the Colombian economy is doing well, although it could be better. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>How would you evaluate the investment climate in Bogotá?<br></strong>2017 was a great year for the city, since certain interesting strategic sectors consolidated. Every year, Bogotá is better positioned as a global business destination. For instance, América Economí­a ranked us the fourth-most attractive city in Latin America, when in 2003 we were in 16th place. Bogotá has an interesting value proposal regarding the size of its economy; it is the same size as the economy of Ecuador and is bigger than countries like Uruguay, Paraguay, Costa Rica, and Panama. The human talent in Bogotá is also key. There are more than 115 higher education institutions, and every year more than 140,000 students graduate from these universities, 33% of them with postgraduate degrees. A third of the country's tech professionals are in Bogotá. We continue to work to make Bogotá a city not just with a better investment climate but also a better quality of life. That is what people seek when they move to a city like ours: gastronomy, culture, arts and public spaces, and events. </p><p><strong>Which sectors in Bogotá receive the most attention from foreign investors?<br></strong>In Bogotá, the local government and the chamber of commerce are currently working together on a development agenda. The city is not only strengthening its service sector, but also providing new opportunities for manufacturing. Invest in Bogotá currently has five teams, two of them working in the service sector. One is oriented toward value-added services and the other works on creative industries. The national government is also interested in this digital content industry, and Bogotá will certainly benefit. Regarding the manufacturing sector, we have two teams: one focused on the healthcare industry and the other on manufactured products that can be sent via air, such as processed food, construction material, and electronic devices. We are looking at Chinese products that now have a tariff in the American market, so we can export our products to the US. The fifth team is infrastructure oriented. There are great challenges to be solved concerning mobility, urban development, and logistics, and we are currently prioritizing 10 projects out of more than 40 that have been studied. These 10 main projects represent more than USD13 billion, and this could be an area for investment where foreign companies can help the city's development. Some of these projects include a subway system, a second airport terminal, and a water treatment plant. All these projects are part of the work we do here. We help the city find global investors that can help build the infrastructure that Bogotá needs.</p><p><strong>What are your expectations and plans for 2019?<br></strong>The trade war between the US and Asia is a situation that we need to monitor closely. Another challenge is the tax reform currently taking place in Colombia; we need our taxes to be competitive with other countries. Another aspect is enhancing free trade zones, so that Bogotá has some of these zones inside the city, and companies do not have to go outside of the city. We are optimistic about 2019. We have at least 40 projects in mind and are looking for major global companies to settle in the city, which will help with Bogotá's development, promotion, and transformation. We also need to continue to work side by side with the local administration and the federal government to have better results. In the last 12 years, Invest in Bogotá has helped bring about more than USD2.5 billion in investment and more than 34,000 direct jobs. For 2019, we expect around USD400-500 million and 5,000 new jobs. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>What growth do you expect for the Colombian economy for the next two years?<br></strong>For 2019, we expect growth of 3.5%, which is much better than 1.4% in 2017 and 2.7% in 2018. Our average growth over the last 15 or even 30 years has been between 3.3 and 3.5%. That is not bad in these times and is good in the region, too. Countries like Bolivia and Uruguay are growing faster, but it is a good rate. And part of the story is that there are huge shocks like oil prices, financial crises, and others. However, right now, we have a new president and less uncertainty, and the tax reforms that were discussed last year have been already decided.</p><p><strong>What sectors will drive the growth in Colombia?<br></strong>Most sectors are doing well. Manufacturing and finance are growing fast. The statistical department has a new method to put the sectors together, so it is difficult to compare things to the past. In general, most sectors are growing faster than in the past. Public administration, commerce, and the financial sector are doing well. Although construction did well in the last two quarters of 2018, that is the sector that we worry about. </p><p><strong>What sectors are the most attractive for international investments? <br></strong>Half of FDI goes to mining, though transport and manufacturing also receive considerable FDI. Oil and mining depend a lot on oil prices, so it varies. Our technical staff is expecting USD63 per barrel in 2019; however, this is difficult to measure. </p><p><strong>What sectors should Colombia look at to diversify its exports?<br></strong>Agricultural exports should be key. They are doing well in Chile and Brazil but not in Colombia. One of the problems is protection in Colombia; we have a protective private sector. We have some products that have 80% tariffs, and if we do not remove these tariffs we will not start to export because it becomes more attractive to sell in the domestic market than exporting. Unfortunately, I do not see this debate taking place. So far, I do not see a discussion on what we have to do. </p><p><strong>How can Colombia address its lagging productivity?<br></strong>To grow more, we have to increase fiscal figures and pension reforms to ensure people save for old age. The best factor to increase productivity would be to open the economy. But we are not doing it.</p><p><strong>What factors could impact the economy long term?<br></strong>We have some balances that we would have to correct. We have fiscal rule in Colombia that reduces the deficit in the long run to 1%, so I expect a structural deficit in the long term. For the next few years, we have to work to reduce subsidies and introduce technologies in the tax system through online invoices. The external deficit of Colombia is close to 3.8%, which is higher than what we expected. </p><p><strong>What are your predictions for the economy in 2019?<br></strong>In general, what I see is positive compared to international volatility and Latin America. Inflation is doing well; the economy is growing, and the exchange rate has been stable. Therefore, we will have a good 2019. </p>]]></richbody0content>

We provide the space to be leased by institutional and multinational companies based in Colombia. In more mature markets such as Europe, the US, and Asia, such real estate warehouses have a number of specifications and features that allow them to perform to the highest standards of security and efficiency. </p><p><strong>What is the role of Colombia in your overall portfolio?<br></strong>Colombia represents almost 50% of the total portfolio for the company, while our projects in Costa Rica and Lima make up 25% each. Our investors count on us to create a significant presence and become a recognizable company in Colombia since it is our largest market. Once we finish or have at least 75% of the project already leased, we expect to either move to Medellí­n or open a new project in Bogotá. We would like to explore Medellí­n, as the conditions there are different.</p><p><strong>What can we expect from LatAm Logistics in 2019 and beyond in Colombia?<br></strong>We want to be recognized as the best logistics provider, first in Bogotá and then in the country. Second, we want to consolidate our image of a regional provider for local companies and be sufficiently attractive to bring in more investors to our platform. We want to not only be recognized by our customers and tenants for our excellent service, but also attract more international investment to our platform, as these infrastructure projects need large sums of money due to land and construction requirements. Therefore, we count on our investors for continued growth. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Colombia and the Netherlands have had a long relationship, though your visit in 2018 was the first time a Dutch leader visited Colombia. Why was this the right time?</strong><br>Colombia is a neighbor of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and is an important and reliable partner. We enjoy a comprehensive bilateral relationship both politically and economically. My visit to Colombia, together with a trade mission of more than 100 companies from the Netherlands, Aruba, and Curaçao, gave us the opportunity to strengthen our ties even further. The signing of the peace agreement with FARC has encouraged many countries, including European ones, to look for business and investment opportunities in Colombia. </p><p><strong>Why is Colombia becoming an attractive destination for investment from all over the world and EU countries, such as the Netherlands specifically?</strong><br>Economic and trade relations between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and Colombia are strong and growing. The extremely dynamic bilateral Chamber of Commerce, Holland House, has grown to 200 members in five years' time, while the Netherlands is among the top-five foreign investors in Colombia. Six Dutch sectors, as we call them 'top sectors,' have identified Colombia as a priority country where they want to explore business opportunities: agrifood, horticulture, water, logistics, life sciences and health, and the creative industries. </p><p><strong>How has the Netherlands' support and experience helped design a better model to achieve Colombia's goals for land titling and formalization?</strong><br>During my visit to Colombia I had the opportunity to visit Apartadó, a region highly affected by the armed conflict. Together with the Colombian Minister of Agriculture Andrés Valencia, we handed out land titles to 25 families of the 'vereda' Los Mandarinos in Urabá. These titles were the result of a pilot project executed jointly by the Agencia Nacional de Tierras and the Dutch Cadastre. The pilot aims to demonstrate that it is possible to register land and provide land titles, faster, cheaper and in a fully participatory way. I spoke to the farmers that have obtained a land title and was extremely impressed to hear their stories of resilience and hope for the future. For farmers, it is important to have a land title. It gives them legal security and enables them to access credits and invest in their land. </p><p><strong>How does Colombia compare to other Latin American countries in terms of investment potential?<br></strong>Economic growth in Colombia has been convincing over many years. Its stable and liberal macroeconomic policies are important for investors and companies from different countries. Colombia is also strategically located, which offers possibilities, for example, in port development. </p><p><strong>What work or improvements still need to be done to increase its competitiveness in terms of attracting investment?<br></strong>An important challenge for Colombia is the need to diversify its economy. The government is aware of this and has formulated policies in this regard. The country relies to a large extent on the exports of natural resources; coal is one of the most important export products. Another challenge the government needs to tackle is improving transport and logistics, sectors that the Netherlands has developed to near perfection. How else could we become the world's second-largest exporter of agricultural products with a country the size of the department of Casanare? Additionally, to further stimulate Dutch investment in Colombia, President Duque and I agreed to sign a double taxation agreement in the foreseeable future. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>The government has presented an ambitious tax reform that aims to reactivate the Colombian economy. How does it work to improve Colombia's attractiveness for FDI?<br></strong>When our government took power, we inherited a difficult situation and low expectations of economic growth in the medium and long term, reinforced by the low rate of economic activity that was evident at that time. These situations put Colombia in the sights of ratings agencies, to the extent that Standard &amp; Poor's reduced the country's credit rating at the end of 2017, and Moody's changed the rating outlook from stable to negative at the beginning of 2018. Faced with this situation, we had to  present a clear plan for economic reactivation during the next four years to businessmen, local and international investors, and even ratings agencies, and the reception was very positive. This was fundamental in order to quickly give assurances that this government has a well-defined structural economic reactivation strategy based on the promotion of private enterprise, support for the free market and innovation, fiscal austerity, formalization, and firm commitment to seek equity as a central objective. What was the immediate effect? That two of the main ratings agencies ratified the credit rating of the country at investment grade. These were the first steps we considered necessary to improve confidence and accelerate the recovery of the Colombian economy, which had been growing discretely. And we were right. The growth of the economy accelerated significantly from 1.4% in 2017 to 2.6% in 2018. Furthermore, after growing at an average of 2.3% in the previous four quarters, the economy grew 2.8% in the last quarter of last year, the second highest figure in three years. Domestic demand was the main protagonist, growing 4.5% in the same period, the highest figure in four years. In that sense, the figures showed a strong rebound of investment, which is lagrely dependent on the confidence of entrepreneurs, with a growth of 6.7% in the fourth quarter, the highest rate in more than four years. This behavior was partially supported by the dynamics of imports of capital and intermediate goods, which are intimately linked to the behavior of investment beyond construction, and grew at their highest rate in almost seven years. Moreover, in the first quarter of 2019, FDI, according to figures from the central bank, grew by 68%. Investment in construction also rebounded to its highest level in two years, growing 4.2% in the fourth quarter, mainly boosted by the civil works component, which showed its first positive growth in that year. The measures we have adopted to unblock the construction of Fourth Generation (4G) projects, led by the Ministry of Transport, as well as other types of infrastructure works, are also showing their first positive results. In effect, road construction, which is the most important component of civil works, displayed its highest growth since the beginning of 2017 after six consecutive quarters of contraction and practically zero growth in the third quarter of 2018. Investment in housing construction grew 2% in the fourth quarter, the second quarter of positive growth after a year of contractions. To this, we must add the new energy surrounding the housing programs that we launched after just 10 months in government. It is worth noting that the residential building area recorded its highest growth in three years and the first positive growth in seven quarters, indicating a positive trend for housing construction in the coming quarters. All these figures have filled us with optimism and we predict GDP growth of 3.6% for 2019. We have always been aware that the confidence that our economic revitalization plan began to generate required concrete and immediate action. We believe it will begin to bear more fruit as of this year. This is where our Financing Law, which was approved by Congress last December, plays a fundamental role. The Financing Law not only constitutes a fundamental step to improve the fiscal prospects of the country, but also includes several measures that stimulate entrepreneurship, investment, productivity, and the formalization of labor and enterprise in the country through the reduction of the corporate tax burden—the effective tax rate, including mandatory contributions, will fall from around 70 to 50% in 2022. With this, we expect an even greater boost to GDP growth, not only in 2019, but also in the medium and long term. That is, we anticipate that one of the effects will be to raise the potential growth of the economy from current estimated levels of 3.5% to levels above 4%. The Financing Law also points to a more progressive personal taxation regime and incorporates a series of measures to strengthen the Colombian Tax and Customs Organization (DIAN), in addition to fighting against tax evasion, which will also contribute to increased levels of tax collection in the upcoming years. In addition to that, we must take into account that, through the “Simple State, Agile Colombia" program, we have simplified 615 administrative procedures (374 procedures, 33 barriers, and 208 standards) and our goal is to reach more than 900 by the end of the year. The interventions we have made have generated savings in the country of more than USD20 billion. That sums up the effort that has been made. To all the above, we must add that in the framework of state visits to different countries, I have participated in forums, held meetings with potential investors, and come together with entrepreneurs from all sectors, whereby I have highlighted the benefits that exist in the country because Colombia is a country that is open, in a decisive way, to investment and business development.</p><p><strong>What is the government's plan to accelerate the technological progress of the Colombian economy?</strong><br>Technology is about how we improve quality of life by bringing knowledge, goods, and services closer to the hands of citizens. And here you have to be realistic. The country, for years, had been demanding regulatory improvement and we eliminated much red tape, because today's world needs intelligent regulation, deregulation associated with the provision of services, and deregulation that allows us to understand the growing competences between new technologies and not continuing with patterns from the past, when we seemed to want legislation to hinder the arrival of new technological tools. That is why we decided to present to Congress a new Law on Information and Communications Technologies—a law that would allow for regulatory convergence, but that at the same time encourages long-term investment so that we can truly reap the benefits of the digital transformation. Finally, we obtained the necessary support in Congress to make this law a reality. Today, we have a law that provides transparency to those who want to invest in the long term. We have a law that is also clear on the independent development of content and one that wants Colombia to become a country that achieves 5G, starting in 2022, because it is from that arrival of 5G that the maximum potential of the IoT and AI really materializes, along with many other technologies of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Today, we have law that allows citizens to guarantee that we will close the great technological gaps, and that 70% of the country, by 2022, will receive broadband coverage. We will be reaching the most remote places of the country with fixed installations, practically closing that gap of about 500,000 homes and giving the municipalities that are part of the Territorial Approach Development Plan 100% coverage, which also means a great social transformation. We must also refer to elements complementary to the Law on Information and Communications Technologies. This law does not come alone; it is accompanied by measures that are also generating enthusiasm in the investment community, through benefits that exist in tax matters for the creative industries and the instruments of promotion of the orange economy, i.e. the creative and innovative sectors. In terms of fintech, we are ready to move forward. We launched in Medellí­n, at the World Economic Forum, the first center for the Fourth Industrial Revolution in a Spanish-speaking country because we want to discuss topics such as the IoT and advanced technologies (AT), and also security technologies and blockchain encryption. Here the role of the Financial Superintendency is essential because we are already realizing that the decision that was adopted to create a regulatory sandbox is increasing the appetite for new operators and new competitors to arrive in the country. It brings us challenges but can also lead us to expand the coverage of financial services through digital platforms and, through this, we can provide room for financial inclusion. Cybersecurity will also be one of the most important tools we will adopt to strengthen financial inclusion in our country and generate confidence on the part of citizens. Likewise, we will hold an auction for the 700Mhz spectrum so that we can also have a presence in the high bands and low bands, and that allows us to guarantee an excellent provision of service. That must also be accompanied by other measures. And the measures have to do with the stimuli that digital entrepreneurship in the country can evolve. A large part of the stimulus is in regulatory quality. However, our wish is that, by understanding the needs of the labor market and the application of technology in the sector, we will have more programmers and more integrated data analysts. We are short about 150,000 professionals according to big players in the sector. With all the above, I can say today that Colombia has taken a historic step in technological issues. In that sense, technology has to be ready to close gaps. And we are seeing that if we take the technology and training to the most remote parts of the country, we also begin to make great transformations. So, for us, coverage, quality, and closing gaps are priorities.</p><p><strong>You have repeatedly emphasized the potential of the orange economy. How is the government working to develop the full potential of Colombia's knowledge economy?</strong><br>This government wants Colombia to be a country of entrepreneurs. That is why, in terms of entrepreneurship, we are making a bold and radical commitment to the orange economy; that is, the creative economy, innovation, and the transformation of ideas into goods and services with high added value. We aspire to make creativity and culture the engines of entrepreneurship, economic development, and the generation of new wealth and, therefore, equity and social progress. Globally, the orange economy contributes between 2 and 11% of GDP, depending on the level of development of an economy. For Colombia, according to the methodology of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), it represents 3.4% of GDP (one and a half times that of mining) and 4.5% of employment (greater than that of coffee), and has huge potential to diversify exports and create quality jobs. Therefore, at the beginning of our administration, we launched a series of measures to support creative entrepreneurs as we realized that they face, in their early years, difficulties such as lack of resources and access to credit. Additionally, through legislation, we granted zero income tax for seven years to those entrepreneurs in creative industries with a minimum amount of investment and a minimum number of jobs. We are helping small businesses through the “Simple Regime" program, whereby, with a single tax ranging from 1.1% of the Industry and Commerce Tax (ICA), to a maximum of 11%, this differentiation is recognized so that there is stronger business formalization throughout the country. We also created a financial instrument called orange bonds, which works like any ordinary bond but its resources are used to finance or refinance, via credit, the activities and projects of companies linked to the orange economy, which belong to any of these three categories: conventional cultural industries, functional creations, new media and software, and arts and heritage. Thanks to these measures, Colombia has roused the interest of large global companies such as Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Apple. Additionally, the Colombian legislature approved a bill to modernize the ICT sector, which seeks to close the digital and connectivity gaps that exist in the country. With all that, we can say that the orange economy has already started and what we want is to multiply its effects in the country.</p><p><strong>What is your approach to boosting Colombian exports?</strong><br>The commercial policy of Colombia is focused on the use of trade agreements and diversifying exports. In order to identify the agroindustry, manufacturing, and services products that have the greatest potential in international markets, a procedure was designed to identify and prioritize them according to the productive capacities of the regions of the country, as well as the degree of potentiality from international demand, and to subsequently identify, analyze, and lower barriers, especially non-tariff barriers, which have impeded exports. In addition, current export promotion instruments that have shown their effectiveness will be strengthened, among them repowering free trade zones and promoting the use of special import-export systems. Elsewhere, international distributors are the right instrument to boost small-scale exports from MSMEs. They can gather small producers working in specialized niches and lower export logistics costs. Trade facilitation is another axis for diversification. On August 21, 2018, the Trade Facilitation Thematic Committee was installed, a component of the National Competitiveness, Science, Technology and Innovation System, composed of representatives of the public and private sectors. Within the framework of this committee, regional and sectoral working groups are tasked with identifying the difficulties faced by the private sector in its import and export processes and to generate measures to solve them. </p>]]></richbody0content>

The government understands the importance of building new firms and attracting more investment to not only increase growth but also build equity to generate employment and build inclusive growth. There are many sectors that the country will develop in the coming years. The tourism sector has grown by double digits in the last four years and attracts millions of international visitors. The sector is growing in terms of domestic tourism and is taking advantage of Colombia's most important assets: our biodiversity, beaches, sun, and the growth in events and convention tourism. Adventure tourism and environmental tourism are also rapidly growing. However, there are many ways to further develop this sector. Another important sector is the creative or orange economy. It takes advantage of one of the most important assets of this country, namely our human capital. The quality, perseverance, resilience, and creativity of our human talent sets Colombia apart from other countries. The creative economy includes traditional sectors such as music, arts, design, fashion, architecture, gastronomy, and even tourism. The sector currently represents approximately 3.8% of GDP, and we expect it to grow to 5% in the coming four years. Another key sector is industry, particularly in metal mechanical and auto parts, as well as in plastics and other sectors. These have developed significantly in terms of productivity and competitiveness. Industry is also growing considerably in terms of exports. In December 2018, industry growth in exports was almost 5%, and we expect this to continue in the medium term.</p><p><strong>How can the ministry help develop a mentality and a culture of entrepreneurship?</strong><br>Something that is different in this country is the courage of our entrepreneurs; the global entrepreneurship index highlighted Colombia as a country with a great deal of potential. We have the organization iNNpulsa to further develop entrepreneurship. Every year, we hold the most important meeting of entrepreneurs called Heroes Fest, and 2018 saw the highest-ever number of attendees. We develop this mentality and culture by holding meetings and discussions with clusters of entrepreneurs in different regions and promoting them. We also give them the opportunity to obtain seed capital to develop their ideas. To further organize the ecosystem of entrepreneurship, we work with institutions such as Fondo Emprender and others focused on entrepreneurship. We have to segment the policy, as sustainable entrepreneurship is different from opportunity entrepreneurship or high-value entrepreneurship. </p><p><strong>Which sectors of the economy are currently the most important for Colombia's export economy?</strong><br>We have three strategies in our trade policy that were also adopted by the national council of trade: taking advantage of current FTAs, facilitating commerce, and legal and loyal commerce. We have a great opportunity to benefit from the many FTAs that Colombia has signed. In terms of the sectors, we want to boost agro and agroindustry products, especially in the EU, where we have almost full access. We have other opportunities in terms of industry, for example in terms of confectionery. Other important sectors include metal mechanical and auto, plane, and boat parts; plastics; and services. We have to open new markets and continue our negotiations with Asian countries and associated nations in the Pacific Alliance to take more advantage of inter-Pacific Alliance commerce. We should also sign partial agreements with African and Caribbean countries, which are important in terms of buying food and agro products. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been the role of Cien Grupo Inmobiliario in the Mexican real estate sector?</h4><p>During our 35 years, we have made all kinds of developments. We started by building small open commercial plazas, industrial warehouses, and offices, as well as residential developments in the countryside. We decided to do residential developments with small lots, swimming pools, sports spaces, and clubs. The success was impressive, and we became the largest rural residential development in Latin America, with more than 11,000 lots. Now we are entirely dedicated to commercial developments.</p><h4>What makes your current commercial developments different from existing offerings? </h4><p>Usually, shopping centers use departmental stores or supermarkets as an anchor. We offer a modern macro market where people have all the comforts of a mall but also have items from the basic food basket. These spaces not only have a section with the classic offerings of a shopping center, but there is also a section with butchers, groceries, and retail fruit shops, with prices of a food market. People can buy the basic food basket up to 40% cheaper than in a supermarket. This model seeks direct trade without intermediaries. Our target market is the middle- and lower-middle class. Our shopping centers are not luxury, and are located in municipalities of medium and low-level income, where there is high a level of population concentrated. Additionally, our commercial developments contribute to employment generation and can be considered “commercial ecosystems." Our development Multicomercial Guadalupe generates 2,000 jobs, for example. These people belong to the socioeconomic target level of the commercial center, so they work in the shopping center, and they also consume what the shopping center offers. It covers all the needs of people and their families. Besides, many businesses within the shopping center buy their inputs in the market of the shopping center. There is a reciprocal chain of consumption, due to this commercial ecosystem. In addition, tertiary employees such as taxi drivers or anyone who works around the mall can be consumers in these shopping centers. At the end, our developments are born with a sound consumer base from within.</p><h4>What is the social impact of Cien Grupo Inmobiliario's commercial developments?</h4><p>We are based in Monterrey, where most of the developments are targeting rich people, which is becoming an oversupplied segment. We are looking at other municipalities that are growing and that have unattended, yet considerable, middle-class sectors. It is more convenient for developers to make a commercial center for wealthier segments, but we have made these kinds of developments to benefit families in under-served markets. In our developments, we make sports courts, outdoor theaters, we offer shows, we put municipal offices, and children's rooms. All these services are free with the presentation of a purchase ticket. The target of our developments are people who cannot pay for those kind of services, so we supply those services. On top of that, we bring municipal services to our developments so that people can do their paperwork with ease. Free schools of arts and crafts, like confectionery and cooking classes, are also available. Our developments include social services that eventually improve the living conditions of large populations. </p><h4>What are the plans to expand other cities in the country? </h4><p>Our concept is different, and we can replicate it in the whole country. First, we want to finish developing in Nuevo León where there is a large market to serve. Simultaneously, we want to explore the country in 2020. We are studying Puebla and Guadalajara. In our investment system, we do not invite investors but the owners of the land. They contribute the land in exchange for commercial premises. Our real estate developments are socially minded. They help people; they leave a mark in the cities and the country. They stay and make history. It brings us great satisfaction as a real estate developer. Beyond profit, there is support and benefit for people. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been INDAABIN's legacy over the past 15 years?</h4><p>A great deal has changed in terms of the way Mexico manages its assets since the creation of INDAABIN 15 years ago. Our establishment was the first milestone of our story. Its predecessor had limited functions and was in charge of appraisals of national assets. With the creation of INDAABIN, the institute became the governing body for federal property, and since then its relevance has increased. In 2017, the Secretary of Finance and Public Trade increased the tax collection responsibilities of INDAABIN. Now, I am honored to preside over the institute and contribute to its work in appraising and managing Mexico's property in an effective way for the benefit of all Mexicans.</p><h4>How do you see INDAABIN's role continuing to grow under the new administration?</h4><p>The new administration seeks to optimize the use of the budget in all areas of government. INDAABIN is working to optimize the administration of national property by making sure every government office has the space it needs to perform its activities in an effective way both for public servants and citizens. There are many activities to do on a daily basis, but the government has defined this as a priority to contribute to a slimmer state. It does not have any problem selling some of its real estate, for example by divesting itself of those properties that are no longer useful or whose value has increased, preferring to relocate a government office elsewhere and sell that property to capture its value for the government. This means we can have better spaces for federal government offices, at the same time creating new resources for the government's future plans.</p><h4>What role do you see INDAABIN playing in important national projects?</h4><p>INDAABIN plays an important role there, because in past projects people complained that the government paid indigenous people too little for their land or overpaid when it was land owned by someone close to the government. INDAABIN's role is to ensure a fair price for land by appraising it using a transparent, internationally approved methodology and eliminating the corruption factor. In these cases, INDAABIN maintains close consultation with the owners during the process. INDAABIN is currently doing all the prices for important government projects like Tren Maya and Santa Lucí­a Airport. We have signed agreements or letters of intent with FONATUR for the appraisals and are working closely with it while it acquires the land for these important projects. We are doing this together to obtain a fair price and improve the quality of life for the public. INDAABIN's pricing methodology is certified by the International Appraisals Standards Committee. </p><h4>How do you see INDAABIN's role with the private sector evolving?</h4><p>There are many ways in which we can relate to the private real estate sector. The most important one is via forums where we discuss relevant issues with appraisers, developers, and public notaries. It is important to maintain strong relationships with the private sector. If we communicate our methodology, promote international certification standards, and work closely with appraisers' and developers' organizations, we will avoid conflicts in the future and work with the private sector in a more effective way. As the President has said, we need to work together with the private sector to achieve the goals he has proposed to create a better Mexico. We are not selling all the properties, but have two or three interesting properties that the President has instructed us to pursue the sale of. We have been in talks with three or four big real estate sector players, and they are interested. By holding a bidding process, we will get a great result for the administration and bring in some money for the projects the government wants to develop. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the portfolio of Cápitel Desarrollos developed over the years?</h4><p>We have 30 years of experience in the real estate business, having developed more than 70 projects located in 10 cities throughout Mexico. We have developed industrial spaces, hotels, office buildings, apartments, shopping plazas, single-family neighborhoods, medical centers, and mixed-use developments. We are currently mostly focused on mixed-use buildings that satisfy the market's real estate needs and help improve the quality of life. We offer spaces where people can work, eat, receive medical attention, have fun, and so on. Our buildings are real shared benefits collaborative communities where people network and form business relationships. For example, Azuna Cancún has 16 floors for offices, four floors for medical offices, and four floors for commercial spaces. Another example is Centralia Cancún, a mixed-use development that includes offices, a commercial and services plaza, a hotel, and an industrial park with buildings that can be adapted into industrial offices. These industrial offices are modern premises for the production industry where in the same place there can be production capacity as well as a sales show room or an office. Our project offices are located in Monterrey, Hermosillo, Querétaro, Mérida, and Cancún and they coordinate projects in seven cities. </p><h4>Given Mexico's highly competitive environment in the real estate market, how can developers work to differentiate their services?</h4><p>Grupo Cápitel throughout its five subsidiaries offers the CÁPITEL 360° Service, an integrated real estate service that starts form land acquisition, to the operation, occupation and management of real estate space. Cápitel Desarrollos develops the projects, from land acquisition to the first round sales, Cápitel Properties runs a real estate investment fund and leased assets, and Cápitel Connect is a marketing and real estate brokerage company that commercializes both its own and third-party buildings. Redwood Property Management is a property management company that helps increase the property value by managing the properties operation and maintaining high occupancy. Last but not least, we have NEX Offices, our business and coworking space centers, where we offer serviced offices for lease including co-working spaces and virtual offices in our six centers in four cities. By 2020, we will have at least three new centers in Cancún and San Luis Potosí­, and Monterrey. Our mission is to develop high-quality real estate that provides great value to its owners and all who visit them. This allows us to keep developing back to back projects with high returns to our investors. The last 15 projects we have done in the last 10 years have produced a yearly ROI of 23% on average and an average occupancy of 94.7%.</p><h4>What are Cápitel Desarrollos' plans for 2019-2020?</h4><p>We currently have four projects under development, and two different ones are about to start. Moreover, we have land reserves that can hold at least four new mixed-use developments. These six projects will be completed between 2019 and 2020. Grupo Cápitel wants to continue growing. We form strategic alliances in the cities where we are, and we want to keep in touch with governments to continue with their help, developing high-quality urban infrastructure for the local communities. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[pick-up-the-pace]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does Mexico play in the company's operations?</h4><p>Mexico has an extremely significant role to play. We are now in a global economy, and this means all international markets have a massive role to play in contributing to UPS' bottom line. The best part about Mexico is that we are growing. 2017 was a great and record-breaking year, and in 2018 we were able to surpass that. Between January 2018 and January 2019, we grew 20%. Mexico plays a huge role in the UPS enterprise. We seek to become the leaders in this market, and we are actively pursuing this goal. </p><h4>How is the rise of e-commerce impacting UPS in Mexico?</h4><p>We cover all the different sectors in this area. Right now, e-commerce is growing the fastest. In the next five years, e-commerce is predicted to grow by 35%, which will challenge us to keep up with this fast pace of growth. Mexico has a population of around 130 million, and 62 million of them have access to the internet; however, only 2% of those 62 million are currently purchasing online. Still, the average age in Mexico is 28, meaning that soon, there will be an explosion in e-commerce. We need to be ready for this growth, and we are excited by the many prospects on the horizon. We are also interested in assisting firms with logistics services and growth development. We are keen to help the micro-, small-, and medium-sized firms that will enjoy growth in the coming years. We will focus more on the export component of our business. We will continue to expand just as we always have. Domestic e-commerce is another area that we will focus on a great deal.</p><h4>How does UPS use technology to improve its operations and efficiency?</h4><p>Every year, UPS invests USD1 billion in technology. Some of this technology goes into our vehicles, including telematics. Telematics is a system in our vehicles that allows us to assess the health and efficiency of our assets. The system lets us know when parts and components are about to break down, so we can change them before things can interrupt our operations. Additionally, there is a safety component to the system that tells us when drivers are speeding, not wearing their seatbelts, or tailgating. The other component of the system shows the driver the most efficient route. </p><h4>In what ways is UPS improving the services it offers in the country?</h4><p>This is difficult to identify because we offer many services. We recently opened a new service in Juarez, and cross-border travel has always been a challenge. A current challenge is how we can expedite moving goods and services from Mexico to the US. There is a great deal of red tape required for businesses to cross the border. There are many changes coming though, which is positive and will help the industry and economy. In Juarez alone, there are around 350 manufacturers interested in cross-border trade, and we are learning about the needs of these firms from a logistics perspective. </p><h4>What are the main areas of opportunity you have identified in Mexico? </h4><p>We are moving forward quickly in Mexico in terms of logistics. The new trade agreement with the US will open up many doors, and goods will be able to flow much more. This includes the flow of goods between countries, and we will only see more goods flowing around the region. The sky truly is the limit, and that is the exciting part about being in Mexico.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why is Mexico the second-largest country in the world in terms of demand for air services?</h4><p>The mobility issues in the country are the primary cause of demand for air travel. Traveling within cities that are important in terms of industrial and economic activity is fairly difficult due to traffic congestion. Air mobility significantly reduces the amount of time it takes to travel from one place to another. The country has a strong oil and gas industry as well that requires the use of helicopters and air taxis frequently. This volume of helicopter use is an area of opportunity for a company such as Voom. We are a digital platform that does not own a single air taxi; our goal is to connect operators with users through an application. A city as congested as Mexico City with a high amount of economic activity requires people to get from one place to another on time and quickly.</p><h4>What is the future of air mobility?</h4><p>The nature of Voom at the moment lies with helicopters, though the future is with Electrical Vertical Take-Off and Landing (eVTOL), an autonomous vehicle being developed around the world that could change the face of urban air mobility. At some point, we will have to incorporate such services. It will ultimately make air mobility more efficient and less costly. These vehicles will likely be electric and less noisy than helicopters as they use smaller blades. The first step for us is to help clients get used to air mobility; one day, it will be as normal as taking the train, car, or bus.</p><h4>How many riders do you target by the end of 2018, and what are your goals for 2019?</h4><p>We have over 50,000 users in our website spread out between Brazil and Mexico, with most of them in Sío Paolo, where we have been operating for a year and a half now. Brazil has a stronger client base and more helipads, and we plan on tripling the number of riders in the system. We are confident in our business in Mexico and have seen steady levels of growth when it comes to people adopting air taxi services and repeat customers. Some clients have already used our service up to 12 times. Owning a helicopter is expensive, and before we entered the market, only those with a fairly high net worth could afford them. Voom allows all people to take advantage of this form of transportation; we are democratizing the use of helicopter and air mobility.</p><h4>How do you ensure there are enough heliports for your application?</h4><p>We have contracts between heliports, operators, and our digital platform. We are only allowed to use heliports with commercial permits since we charge landing fees. Mexico City only has three heliports with these permits, and all are part of our platform. Private licensed heliports that want to be part of our network will have to switch and apply for the commercial permit.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What steps did the company take to realize it could go from being a bus company to an intelligent mobility solutions company?</h4><p>A few years ago, we realized that although we were doing a good job in transporting people from one city to another, we could do more. Around five years ago, we acquired a company in Spain and figured that mobility is much more integrated than just from one city to another. We therefore decided to evolve from a regular bus company into a mobility group. We want to improve the lives of people in cities. At MOBILITY ADO, we believe that every client's mobility needs start right before they plan to go on a trip, in terms of how the ticket is purchased and the best mode of transportation, no matter the purpose of the trip. People in cities with excellent mobility systems have a higher quality of life and are thus much happier. Our mission is to make the experience of customers better in order to improve their lives. This means the way passengers get to the terminal, the trip itself, and how they connect to the urban systems have to be more integrated. </p><h4>What do cities in Mexico need to do to avoid congestion?</h4><p>We have to start viewing cities as systems and invest in public transport; cities that invest in infrastructure for cars are becoming less mobile. Mexico City has had some success in the BRT and metro systems but there is a need to integrate them further. We are trying in Querétaro to take over the urban system, and this will be a huge challenge for us. We have to transform it into an integrated system to improve the quality of life. Several Mexican cities have political issues regarding transport, but the stakeholders fail to prioritize people's mobility needs. </p><h4>What does your mobility project in Querétaro consist of?</h4><p>We are developing eight routes that will go through the city. In some areas, there will be buses and cars but the difference is that it is an integrated system with one ticket to pay for all the different modes of transport. The project is huge and quite a challenge with 150 people from MOBILITY ADO working there. The governor of Querétaro fully understands what is needed to transform it into a city with an improved mobility system. This is why he chose to partner with us, which is the first such partnership in Mexico. We expect to receive 250 buses in August, and that will make a difference. We already have the payment method and are trying to integrate it to inform and educate the city about its uses and features. We are trying to build a strong base to start seeing results in 2019.</p><h4>What other countries or regions are you targeting?</h4><p>We are expanding our operations in Central America, with a particular interest in Guatemala and Costa Rica. We are trying to make international routes from Tapachula in Mexico all the way through to Panama, which is set to be completed by the end of the year. In Guatemala, we have been present for nine years, and in 2019 we decided to cover the entire of Central America. We are looking at opportunities in India, South America, Ghana, and Australia, so we are proud to be considered as an option in countries across the world. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>During this six-year term, the federal budget in the transportation sector will be slightly higher than MXN600 billion (USD31 million). President Andrés Manuel López Obrador is clear about the idea of stimulating the participation of private initiatives. In 2019, there will be an investment of MXN70 billion (USD3 million), which will be channeled to various road programs, ports, airports, railways, and telecommunications.</p><p>The private sector will be invited to invest MXN20-25 for each peso invested from the public budget. This will preserve the state's control over concessions. We have many infrastructure needs, which is why the government is working on several projects. We are going to reactivate the merchant navy and the roads. The government will participate in the development of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, which is fundamental for the development of the southeast, as well as in Tren Maya and the paving of 300 roads to municipal capitals. </p><p>Work will be carried out on the conservation and maintenance of the transport infrastructure and the continuation of useful works in process. The country is full of half-finished or paused projects, which have stalled for many years. These need to be finished in order to make the resources that have been invested there valuable.<br> The Secretary of Communications and Transportation stresses that attention will be given to the strain on the International Airport of Mexico City. That airport will be rehabilitated. There will also be a boost for the Toluca airport, which has a capacity of 4 or 5 million passengers. Today, it only moves 600,000 users. A third international terminal will be built in Santa Lucí­a. These terminals will have national and international operations.</p><p>Another project to be promoted will be universal broadband internet connectivity. This connectivity will spur the development of new generation communications networks, essential for security, education, public health, culture, and communication. <br></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[zachary-venegas-executive-chairman-ceo-helix]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What drove you to create Helix TCS?</h4><p>My professional background has been highly invested in frontier markets. As these develop, there are necessary components that must be put in place to enable a truly open and transparent marketplace. This is especially critical in the cannabis sector, as there are social equity, law enforcement, and social cost concerns that do not exist to the same degree in other markets. We recognized very early on in the development of legal cannabis that this type of integrated critical infrastructure platform would be needed in order to create a global marketplace, which is our vision.</p><h4>What is the main added value you offer to the growing Latin American medical cannabis market? </h4><p>We provide critical infrastructure services such as seed-to-sale tracking, security, transport, and wholesale marketplaces that are necessary to facilitate a global B2B cannabis marketplace, and allow Latin American countries to realize the full economic and social potential of their competitive advantages. We are facilitating the transition from the black market to the legal market, which means billions of dollars in revenue to governments, communities, entrepreneurs, and employees. As the global market matures, product manufacturers or dispensaries in large consumer markets like the US will begin seeking ways to import products from competitively advantaged markets. They will demand a means of verifying that the product was grown legally and carries verifiable test results, all of which must be backed by a government stamp of approval. Our critical infrastructure platform provides all such services in a single place, supported by the data analysis that gives business, governments, and investors the ability to track financial, operational, and other market outcomes. </p><h4>How can you help new companies overcome the biggest challenges of the market? </h4><p>One of the biggest challenges is certainly the ever-changing compliance requirements. All of our services are tailored to the unique operating requirements in any given jurisdiction. We currently provide seed-to-sale tracking services for dispensaries and grow facilities as well as government traceability through BioTrackTHC, our leading technology services provider; security and transport services through Helix Security, which is the largest cannabis-focused security operator in the industry; and the oldest and only fully compliant wholesale marketplaces through Cannabase and Amercanex. All of our businesses function together to create an unmatched data source for the global industry.</p><h4>What are the main advantages that the Mexican market offers the industry, and what strategies are you using to enter the country? </h4><p>Mexico possesses a climactic advantage and is capable of producing massive amounts of legal cannabis and industrial hemp year-round at a lower cost than the US or Canada. In addition, Mexico will have a significant medical cannabis patient count that could result in a lucrative market. We already have a strong foothold in several Latin American and Caribbean markets including Colombia, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico. In the latter, we provide the government cannabis traceability system to oversee the island's entire medical cannabis supply chain. We provide a Spanish user-interface for seed-to-sale tracking through BioTrackTHC, supported by Spanish-speaking technical support agents across multiple time zones. As soon as there is a legal product and thus, a need to track it, we expect to enter Mexico immediately.</p><h4>What are your main goals for 2019?</h4><p>Our performance has kept pace with the rapid growth of the industry. Helix TCS was established in 2015 and since then it has reached quarterly revenue of USD3.45 million, with 199% revenue growth in 1Q2019. We are the largest provider of security services in Colorado, and BioTrackTHC has been publicly identified as the leading provider of dispensary POS software in the US. As the industry expands, we are poised to grow alongside it. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were your operational results in 2018 and how do they compare to 2017? </h4><p>We achieved 18% growth in 2018 YoY. Our goal is to grow 12% in 2019 with annual sales of MXN900 million for car rental and international royalties.</p><h4>What differentiates your services from other car rental companies?</h4><p>We offer an inclusive product on our website with a simple rental process and the lowest required deposit in the market. Our variety of cars stands out in the market. We plan to expand our presence in Querétaro, Culiacán, and two locations in downtown Mexico City. We will also expand our affiliate program, which at present is in 42 locations in 20 different countries, to 100 locations in 35 countries. Notably, we are committed to reducing our carbon footprint. We will replace 400 vehicles in our fleet with hybrid cars such as Toyota Prius, Prius C, Hyundai Ioniq, Toyota Camry, Rav4, and Kia Niro, among others.</p><h4>Why is the company deciding to expand into three more cities? </h4><p>Querétaro's airport has the highest growth percentage in the country. Even though it is a small airport, its potential is relevant for the business sector and Mexico-American travelers that come back to Mexico to visit their relatives. Moreover, the airport in Culiacán is being consolidated for the business sector. It is essential for every business in Mexico to have presence in the capital, since it has the highest number of tourists flying to other locations across the country.</p><h4>What is your outlook on tourism in Mexico, and how does this impact demand for your services?</h4><p>Approximately 73% of the tourism in Mexico is domestic, which we find amazing. The growth of low-cost airlines impacts our industry positively since they now connect different destinations within the country. This leads to an increase in demand for our services.</p><h4>What will the future of mobility in Mexico look like?</h4><p>Car sharing and ride hailing will continue to have relevance for new generations. The traditional car rental is obligated to evolve so it can work as a hybrid. We are also focused on making the rental process simpler in different ways. For example, in the future, the owner will have most of the responsibility, not the driver. We are adapting to this changing reality by investing in our technology department to add value to every chain of the company. We have developed a ride-hailing platform and will soon launch our car-sharing platform as well. We estimate to launch these by end-2019. The ridesharing project is our priority, and ours is a great and stable platform. Equally important, ride sharing will help to reduce our carbon footprint significantly.</p><h4>When it comes to providing transportation to and from airports, in what ways are you starting to discuss it with the public sector? </h4><p>We are also willing to collaborate with the public sector on transporting people to and from airports on electric buses. There are many ways to approach it; however, coordination is needed between airports and the private and public sectors. Our proposal is to develop a mobility center in each airport according to the air traffic of every terminal. This plan must feature, depending on the infrastructure, mass transportation, shared transports, and personalized transportation.</p><h4>What would you like the new administration to prioritize in terms of mobility?</h4><p>The focus should be on promoting and supporting the car sharing industry. The public sector should also promote car sharing in government departments to make efficient usage of public resources and parking spaces. Another idea is to incentivize the use of electric or hybrid cars. The government should also standardize and coordinate mobility centers at airports to promote the organized use transportation.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What major challenges regarding clinical trials do companies face when bringing medicine to Mexico?</h4><p>The biggest challenge is definitely regulatory affairs. We are not sure yet about the Federal Commission for the Protection against Sanitary Risks' (COFEPRIS) impact on review process under the new government, but I hope there will not be a significant impact in this field. We are doing fine regarding quality and patient recruitment because companies know that we will produce the results. Throughout Latin America, Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico are the top three countries in terms of medicinal products. For us, it helps that we are next to a country like the US that has a large pharmaceutical industry. But they still have molecules that we don't have access to. Usually, the development of new molecules takes place in the US, the EU, China, and India.</p><h4>What clinical trials are you working on?</h4><p>Our main areas are rheumatology, pediatrics, immune respiratory diseases, urology, and dermatology. We are working with a stage-two and stage-three rheumatoid arthritis clinical trial and medical monitoring. This trial is focused on small molecules since it is part of a biological therapy. The medicine was launched in 2018 but we still have 41 patients who have been taking the medicine for the last five years. Mexico has many types of medicine, including those that are considered new drugs. There might be a medicine against orphan diseases that is available around the world but not in Mexico because of low demand, and these are most likely to be the ones that you cannot find in the country. COFEPRIS has the power to authorize medicines in Mexico, and this facilitates the process. Once it's in Mexico, it can be easily found in Latin America, even if the US doesn't approve it. COFEPRIS and Latin American audits have gained this recognition.</p><h4>How do you use alliances to improve your clinical trials?</h4><p>Bioclinica is a global research network that works with all kinds of pharmaceutical companies. It offers projects to us since it has the quality they are looking for. The main advantage is that we have direct contact with them and not through an intermediary. Therefore, they offer feedback on things like our recruitment system. We also work with big laboratories, such as AbbVie, that have partner research sites and are looking for sites that guarantee quick regulatory affairs, patients, and quality. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Italy is 90% SMEs]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[alessandro-benetton-chairman-founding-managing-partner-21-invest]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>More than 100 investments with an aggregate rate of return of 20%. What have been the key drivers to achieve this success?</h4><p>My vision since day one was to find correlations between different variables in different sectors, and this was before big data was available. Since Italy is 90% SMEs, especially so in the Venetian area, instead of getting involved with something large, I decided to invest in companies where I could understand 100% of what was going on regarding marketing, production, and communication. During the first phase, it was difficult to demonstrate that my theory was right, because we were doing minority cases. By the end of the 1990s, I realized that my approach was right in many cases. Over the years, we have found that in order to create value, you need a vision, and the vision can be substantiated by an opportunity during a change in the system. We need to sell companies that are better than companies that we acquired.</p><h4>What are the defining criteria in selecting the companies in which you will invest? What success stories are you most proud of?</h4><p>The movie theater sector with Space Cinema is a great example of discontinuity. We entered a sector with no margins; everyone expected technology to kill the sector, as people shifted to watching movies on their phones, tablets, and computers. We looked at it from another way. In the US, the sector still represented aggregation from a social point of view. Starting from this observation, we envisioned a different market. Everyone was losing money in the sector due to extremely high fragmentation and conflicts of interest; most of the players were in the production business as well. They had to make money selling movies and were negotiating with tough distributors. We started by investing in side businesses such as food and books that are sold there to solidify our revenue streams. We did not see a reason for theaters to be empty on Saturday mornings, for example, and began streaming football games or documentaries for schools, or live opera using satellite technology. We boosted sales that way and consolidated about 30% of the market share in Italy. Then, it was time to go to the majors, and we told them we did not want to pay the huge prices they were demanding. After negotiations, it became a sector where everyone makes money. We were truly a game changer, and even though it is not well known, we made a difference. Then, there was Pittarosso; the success there was starting to apply the same industrial approach of continuously changing the collection, applying a fast fashion vision to the shoe business for the first time. For Forno D'Asolo, it was more of a straightforward situation, as we believed the frozen food technology could improve enormously. It is the only company with its own frozen food distribution chain. We invested heavily in technology, and the quality of the product increased. We also made many investments in terms of the workforce. That was the first case in which we fully applied the shared value approach with local communities and schools. There is also a case in the wine industry with Farnese, perhaps the most eloquent case of shared value. We collaborated with entrepreneurs talented in commercial business to design a method to teach small local suppliers how to maintain a high level of quality that takes quantity out of the equation. We designed a program to certify good suppliers, which changed the process in the sense that people who truly care about their vineyards can continue to do an incredible job and gain recognition for it rather than rushing to produce a large quantity of wine. It was a sector that was doing well but had not seen big growth; however, as a result of our work, we tripled sales and profit. On average, the above companies have tripled their profit.</p><h4>What sectors hold the biggest potential in the coming years?</h4><p>I look for situations where we can add a different perspective. I am skeptical of anything where we are expected to work in continuity. We do not say we have to be revolutionary, though we are looking for something new. Today, with technological advancement, all sectors are heavily influenced. People live and work differently than they did before. People eat and move differently. Therefore, distribution and food are at the top of my list.</p><h4>What are some of 21 Invest's commitments to sustainability?</h4><p>We are the first private equity company in the world to have joined Michael Porter's Shared Value initiative. When I first met Al Gore in the mid 1990s, he told me that when talking about sustainability, one has to make sure what they are doing is advantageous for people. We should focus on philanthropy and good practices; however, at the end of the day, the important thing is to make it convenient. I have always kept that in mind, and we have proven that commitment. Our business is to find excellent companies and spot excellent entrepreneurs that create value for both investors and society.</p><h4>How do you plan to further increase the commitment of your investors in the coming years?</h4><p>What makes us unique in today's landscape is that we are a good balance between a reasonable size and a distinguished footprint in the way we approach investment. Our competitive advantage is that each company, no matter how small, is part of our own family. We really do care and bring a level of relationship, knowledge, and brainpower. Having said that, growth is our objective. We probably grow every new fund by about 20% of the prior fund. We have an industrial vision, and one thing that is important is that our companies outperform their budgets after they are sold. This means we have done a good job.</p><h4>How do you assess the appetite for private equity in Veneto?</h4><p>Now, compared to where we started, there are many more options. It will continue to be a healthy business because, despite pessimism in recent years, looking at statistics, many companies are doing well. That says there is still fertile ground for entrepreneurs and activities, and I see no reason why that should not continue.</p><h4>On the other hand, what challenges does this sector face?</h4><p>They are many, including technological and managerial. Size is a factor. Sometimes, you end up in sectors where size does matter, and that means you need to know enough about managerial skills and organizational skills. In Italy, we are not strong in that respect. At the same time, there is an incredible level of ability in terms of adaptation, and we can capitalize on that.</p><h4>What can we expect from 2020?</h4><p>We are becoming better at measuring what we do and the shared value approach. There is a new aspect today that is profound and has not been recognized yet, namely social sustainability, which means taking sustainability to an even more advanced level. The consumer of the future will recognize the role of companies that care about social sustainability. This is a trend that we have been following since we were established.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main trends in the market when it comes to cybersecurity?</h4><p>We have more than 10 years of experience working in Mexico and more than 21 years worldwide. We are a cybersecurity laboratory. Approximately 30% of our employees are focused on R&amp;D, which gives us the strength to monitor and understand what happens nationally and internationally. Through our monitoring, we are witnessing 746 daily attacks on a global level, or nine attacks per second. We monitor more than 100 attackers that are composed of groups of spies with a strong arsenal of technology and tools to get information or money. We are also continuing to work on our antivirus program, which has grown by 18% in Mexico; however, intelligence, monitoring, initial response, and other technologies focused on the financial aspect of the industry have grown by 40%. AI is trending, and we can help protect that aspect. However, this technology is not enough, and analysis is necessary. The expertise of people with these tools creates the HuMachine technology, superior to AI. The consultancies that we offer help companies understand their infrastructure, processes, and vulnerabilities year by year based on the budget, needs, urgencies, or priorities. We assist in strategy and cybersecurity culture so that it is coherent at all levels. However, the person can be a point of vulnerability. Cybersecurity and technological innovation go in opposite directions, and we, as experts, must warn the industry about this because the attacks will be increasingly sophisticated.</p><h4>Why is Mexico one of the 10 countries worldwide in terms of cyber attacks?</h4><p>There is a lack of strategy and prevention. Companies do not take immediate actions after being attacked, and they let a long time pass without a contention reaction. The people in charge of cybersecurity both in government and in the private sector must have a reaction strategy. We always talk about data, though now we must talk about people. There are already cases of hacking of trains, subway, cars, water, gas, industrial machinery, and airports. We help more than 20 car manufacturers like Audi, BMW, and Mazda avoid being hacked when users connect to their automobiles. The Wi-Fi communication between the car and the user's mobile device must be protected. The IoT is strong now, and someone else can access those devices and know one's location by GPS or habit frequency. That is why it is important to change our home's Wi-Fi password periodically. We must use secure channels to make bank transactions, recordings, and encrypted phone calls, among others.</p><h4>What does the public sector need to do to increase cybersecurity in Mexico?</h4><p>The public needs to be more aware of risks and attack channels that can affect people. We must be aware of the apps we use and the tools to protect them. This applies to everyone, from individuals to SMEs and large companies and industries. It is everyone's job to have this information and understand what is happening.</p><h4>How will the development of IoT impact the future of cybersecurity?</h4><p>There are no borders anymore. Attacks can originate from anywhere in the world. The laws will change. We are promoting a transparency center in Switzerland to make clarifications without the participation of third parties such as Interpol Organization of American States (OAS) and other impartial entities. The trend toward the future is skepticism because there is a great deal of information, and we do not know what is real. Another trend is the strengthening of laws in case of an attack in any part of the world. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What factors led up to the acquisition of Software Blanco and the subsequent rebranding as Delete Technology?</h4><p>Blanco used to be a Finnish company until it was sold in 2014 and became part of a group from the UK. Delete Technology is now a fully Mexican company with a presence all over Latin America. The acquisition was a major step forward for our company. When we opened an office in Mexico, we were following the company's general strategy. We became independent in early 2018 and came up with new ideas for the company, as doing business in Mexico and Latin America differs from Europe. In the region, companies are more concerned about receiving certain services rather than just the software. We have a wide range of services, which has helped us form better relationship with our clients.</p><h4>What are the main characteristics of your average customers?</h4><p>Our customer profile is divided between private corporations, financial institutions, and the government. We have a greater focus on the latter, as the Privacy Act opened many doors for us. The government is required to follow a strict set of norms and compliances when erasing data. This was the first segment that we started to serve in Mexico. Financial institutions are another important target for us, as they have to abide by many international regulations. The banking system in Mexico is dominated by foreign companies, and most of the top banks are international. The few Mexican banks that are owned by Mexicans also need to comply with these norms, so that is a great market for us. The third customer base is corporations listed on the stock exchange that need to comply with international regulations. </p><h4>How well prepared are Mexican companies when it comes to cybersecurity?</h4><p>In the last several years, Mexico has invested a great deal of money in cybersecurity. Private companies, government entities, and banks are now familiar with the risks, and hackers have shown what they are capable of. Now, securing customer data is a large issue for companies, and they are investing accordingly. We see a great deal of excellent qualifications from people leading IT security departments. In Latin America, Mexico is the leading country in this regard. We do need to start developing applications, software, and hardware in the region related to security in order to improve. Most of the technology comes from the US, Europe, and Israel. These areas are developing many solutions, while national security agencies typically prefer the local development of this technology when possible. This is a gap that needs to be closed in the region.</p><h4>How do you plan to continue expanding in Mexico?</h4><p>Mexico is our biggest market, while Colombia our second-biggest market and it is growing significantly. Even though Brazil is the largest country and economy in the region, it does not have the latest technology or an established data protection law. That makes it difficult to convince people that they need our product. Due to security reasons, Colombia has been investing significantly in technology, especially cybersecurity. That is why it is a great market for us; the more rules and regulations there are in place, the more popular our software is.</p><h4>What are your plans to expand your services and products in the region?</h4><p>In Mexico, we have covered most of the market. Our next challenge is the change of administration. Many contracts will come to an end in 2019, and we seek to renew those. Hopefully, we can retain the trust of our customers on the government side. Mexico is a steady country in terms of income for the company, and we are focusing more on Latin America, specifically Colombia, Chile, and Brazil. We have distributors in the region, though the next step is to open offices in these locations. We are currently the leading company in Latin America, as we have been operating since 2006. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the role of the Mexican market within Oracle's global strategy?</h4><p>Mexico is one of the most important countries in Latin America, and worldwide it is among the countries with more potential growth in terms of adoption of technology. However, this is not new. Oracle has a 30-year history in Mexico and has been a benchmark for various technological trends over the years. Mexico is the second-most important country in Latin America after Brazil, and, therefore, sets the trends for other markets in the region. Many clients from other countries come to Mexico for reference visits and to grasp what is being done locally. The proximity of Mexico with the US is also significant in terms of infrastructure and software applications such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) and human capital management (HCM), among others. Mexico is a reference country for Latin America and Oracle worldwide. </p><h4>What kind of solution do you offer to SMEs?</h4><p>Previously, Oracle solutions did not have an offering for SMEs, which were left behind in the world of technology, lacking the CAPEX to invest and regularly update their technology. Today, the SME segment is the fastest growing in terms of cloud service adoption in all of Latin America. In the region, there is a great imbalance between the companies at the base of the pyramid and those at the summit. Oracle has traditionally oscillated between the large- and medium-scale companies, but now we also cover the base. The SME sector is growing because of the ability to offer services in the cloud that reduces operational costs. The cloud allows innovation and constant transformation, whereby SMEs become more competitive in the market. With our new approach, small companies can have a world-class solution in the cloud, one that can make a difference.</p><h4>What main areas of opportunity have you identified to transform the Mexican market?</h4><p>The growth in the adoption of technology in the Mexican market lies in customer service, technological infrastructure, and ERP and HCM enterprise applications. There are other solutions such as business analytics, supply chain management—which goes hand in hand with ERP and business intelligence—and transportation management. We have a great solution suite that yields results for the hospitality and transportation sectors, which again, is a reference for Latin America. This private sector solutions suite is used by distribution, logistic, and transport systems. Grupo Bimbo, Mexico's largest bakery company, has just started a worldwide logistics solution implementation.</p><h4>What is your vision as the new Managing Director at Oracle? What kind of transformation are you looking to instill in Mexico?</h4><p>Oracle Mexico is part of a larger strategy and purpose at a Latin American level. It has a global framework but is essentially a regional initiative. The purpose is for technology to be associated with people as end users. Oracle is recognized as a B2B company, but now we also want to be a B2C company. Starbucks makes use of Oracle solutions. Four pillars are being determined in Latin America: the people, our customers, technological innovation, and our communities. We ask ourselves how we can help companies grow, reduce their costs, and differentiate themselves in the market. We do this with a mixture of people and technological innovation. Finally, we are concerned about how we can support communities. Start-ups are part of the growth of any community, and we provide them with the knowledge that promotes growth. This will result in improving the economy of Mexico. We are investing in a center in Guadalajara with a capacity of 4,000 people.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What kind of cycle is the mining industry going through at the moment?</h4><p>The mining business is extremely cyclical. It goes from boom to bust. My own belief is that we are moving from a bust period into a boom period, but the recovery will be slow. The precious metals sector will recover before the industrial materials and base metals sector. From a Mexican perspective, over the next two years you will see strength in the silver sector in particular, which is important to Mexico. You will also see increased investor interest in the mining sector. Mining has been an important economic sector for a long time, but the global economy of 2019, which is all about adding value, basic resources are less important than in the past, a trend likely to continue. Booms and busts are self-correcting. During certain periods, like the last five years when commodity prices were low, sustaining capital investments and new investments did not occur. Mining is a business where your existing business depletes is over time. As such, the industry's ability to supply basic commodities declines. When supply and demand meet as a consequence of supply destruction, it takes the industry a long time to ramp up to meet the pricing signals. New mines are expensive and there are long lead times before they open. We are in a circumstance now where the copper business, for example, is in a rebuilding period. The thing that could derail it is not unique to Mexico. It is global. </p><h4>What Mexican companies are you currently investing in?</h4><p>We have been involved in Mexico for a long time, mostly North American companies that have been active in Mexico. I personally have been a Fresnillo shareholder in various sizes since the 1980s. We have been successful in Mexico in making and selling discoveries for a long time. I would say the largest position we have that North Americans would be familiar with in Mexico is a company called MAG Silver, which is a partner with Fresnillo. It is a high-quality deposit. We are eager to restart our generative exploration in Mexico, but we are concerned about how the community consultation procedures proposed by President Andrés Manuel López Obrador will affect our abilities, particularly in the Sierra Madre and particularly as a consequence of the presence of drug traffickers in the area. We do not know how this legislation will impact the mining businesses ability to operate safely and legally in western Mexico. Therefore, until our Mexican partners show us how that will be done, we are going to have to sit out. We are waiting a little to see what happens because that part of the business grassroots exploration, particularly in the Sierra Madre, is not a place where we feel welcomed. </p><h4>Which mining companies do you have a more positive outlook on apart from the big four Mexican ones?  <br></h4><p>The big four have some advantages right now. They may be less interesting, but they have deep advantages. Traditionally, operating in Mexico has been more of a political and social challenge than a technical one. Mexico has an amazing mineral endowment, especially in the west. We can literally prospect reserves with imagery from satellites. However, prospecting has driven mining success in Mexico, which has only come through understanding political challenges at a state and federal level, and undertaking community engagement at a local level. The big four Mexican companies have been able to exist in that environment. They are not necessarily loved at the local level, but they understand how to operate there. And they have also been historically able to operate better than foreigners from the US and Canada have at the federal and state level. So they have some definite competitive advantages over American and Canadian companies. We have an advantage over them, too, in that Mexican companies traditionally have been risk adverse and have not done the level of grassroots exploration that we have been willing to. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-quick-study]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the biggest areas of opportunities for Mexico to strengthen its mining industry?</h4><p>Mexico has huge potential to be a mining country; approximately 70% of its territory has not been explored for mining potential. The Frasier Institute in Canada ranked it 11th in the world in 2011 in terms of 15 different parameters for mining jurisdictions, but in the last four years we fell to 44th place. This was due to a variety of reasons, including additional taxes collected for local communities. However, only part of the money goes to mining communities; part of it is also kept by the state. Over the last four years, the mining industry paid close to MXN16 billion (USD837.384 million), a large amount of money that takes too much time to distribute and see an impact in these communities. This taxation made the industry lose a great deal of competitiveness against other mining jurisdictions. The new government in Argentina is also making major changes that are catching the attention of investors, while Peru has been declared a mining country and put in place favorable policies to attract investors. Mexico needs public policy to ensure greater certainty of investments similar to other countries, which is the government's responsibility. We, the industry, also need to invest in technology and systems. Another issue is that when one purchases land, they do not have any certainty it will be theirs, as the registration is not up to date.</p><h4>What is your top priority as the new president of CAMIMEX?</h4><p>There is a list of eight or nine things that the mining chamber has identified and that we are proposing to the new government. It has been extremely open and interested thus far. The new president has made a list of 25 priorities, of which one is mining. The government needs to recognize that mining can be a great way to develop isolated communities. Typically, mining goes where no one does, and we can bring in services, education, and infrastructure to isolated locales. We can also be an excellent arm for the government to look into the development of isolated regions in the country. One of the top priorities is to change the image of mining. Unfortunately, many do not know exactly what we do; many think it is a highly dangerous accident-prone industry, but that is not the case.</p><h4>What is your strategy to break these paradigms?</h4><p>We need to recognize our audience and speak the same language. Indeed, we need to let them know what our business is about, how we interact with communities, and how we care about our people. We are morally responsible for every one of our workers and committed to their safety, well-being, and health. We also need to learn how to transmit this, gauge how involved we are in different activities with the community, and show that we care about the environment. Mining is an activity closer to nature than any other. Since we depend on natural resources, we must also care greatly about them.</p><h4>What are the advantages of expanding your focus from Mexico to Latin America?</h4><p>It is always positive when a big company looks at different areas. There are mining deposits everywhere, and we need to go wherever makes sense for our culture and business philosophy to seek new businesses. Peru and Chile are extremely convenient for us in terms of culture, language, and ways of doing business. They also have a quick learning process. We have been there for many years now and have different projects in different stages of exploration. We have a project in Peru that is at the end of a successful exploration process. Our intention is to finish the exploration, acquire the land, develop the project, and operate it. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[can-you-dig-it]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the new administration's vision for the Mexican mining industry?</h4><p>The government has good intentions to promote investment in mining as well as increase production for the benefit of the country. Initially, it will focus on increasing the taxes the federal government receives for mining production, a policy toward which our company will contribute greatly given that the new Buenavista del Cobre concentrator is already operating. It is the largest concentrator in Mexico and was part of a USD3.1-billion investment over two years that is already producing more than 110,000 tons of milled minerals per day. With that investment, the people of Sonora are receiving more benefits in the form of much greater tax revenues through the Mining Fund. For example, the people of Cananea received MXN240 million (USD12.6 million) to invest in infrastructure. Yet, the current government seems to want to change this and use the money in other unforeseen ways.  </p><h4>What advantages does Mexico offer the mining sector?</h4><p>The water we need generates one of the highest costs because the government is in charge of it. In Peru, water is cheap, and in the US, we pay nothing because the owner of the land owns what is underground. Other than that, in Mexico, there are not as many problems with the communities as in other countries. We had some problems in the past with the ejidos, communal farming land, and there are still occasional problems when we need to buy their land, as they want to sell at high prices. However, states with a mining history and knowledge about the sector are in favor of attracting foreign investors. For example, Sonora has many investors from Canada.</p><h4>What are the company's international expansion plans?</h4><p>We are looking at entering Ecuador, Argentina, and Chile and working to continue developing the ASARCO mines in Arizona. Mexico will continue to play a central role, as this is where the headquarters of the group are located. We have a railroad throughout the state of Florida in addition to the railroad in Mexico we have with Ferromex from Mexico City to the border, not to mention our railroad to Mérida. We also have an infrastructure subdivision part of the group that includes a construction and an engineering company. Moreover, we drill in the sea and on land for Pemex. There are certain benefits for us to make investments in energy. At present, we generate enough energy to serve our projects and generate some cash flow by selling the rest. We produce energy from gas and wind in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and want to do a solar energy project in northern Sonora for Mexicana de Cobre and Buenavista del Cobre. Two-thirds of Americas Mining Corporation's production was in Mexico and a third in Peru. In the latter, it will improve thanks to the Toquepala concentrator, which will increase production by up to 100%.  </p><h4>Which of your projects in development are about to start producing in Mexico?</h4><p>We are just about to start the Buenavista zinc project, which will export zinc and copper reserves. We need to extract those reserves to continue exploring the copper that is underneath. In 2019, the construction of that plant begins, and it will take about two years before it starts producing zinc. With this production and that of our underground mines here and in Spain, we will produce a significant amount of zinc for Grupo Mexico. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-right-kind-of-investment]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the biggest challenges facing the energy sector as a result of the new administration?</h4><p>The most important challenge for the industry is to understand how it can work with the new administration to continue investing for the benefit of the country and industry. But we need to give it some time, even a year. At the beginning of 2019, President López Obrador announced that the administration had national electricity and oil plans, though he was only talking about policy sketches, not the completed policies themselves. These will likely be issued in 2Q2019 as a result of the National Development Plan public consultation process. Many in the industry are waiting to see what else they can do under this new administration.</p><h4>What are the pending issues for the energy reform?</h4><p>The energy reform that was approved in 2013 and passed by Congress in 2014 requires further steps in terms of implementation. Although the Energy Regulatory Commission (CRE), the National Hydrocarbons Commission (CNH), and the Ministry of Energy (SENER) issued most of the regulations needed, some issues continue to be pending. For example, the new rate schemes for the distribution of natural gas or electricity tariffs. In addition, some manuals of the rules of the electricity market are still pending. Although these are not essential pieces of regulation and the industry can work with the existing regulation, they are still important pieces of the new framework that have to be finished in order to give more certainty for investors to make project decisions in Mexico. Investors are also waiting for the National Electricity and Hydrocarbon Plans, which will lay out the policies for the rest of the administration. These documents will provide more information about the role that the private sector, PEMEX, and the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE) will play, and, hence, the opportunities for investment.</p><h4>As one of the architects of the reform, what does the gas market in Mexico need to be more competitive in comparison to other global markets?</h4><p>All energy segments are different, and what is needed in Mexico's natural gas market is not the same as the electricity or oil products markets. We have different situations and stages of evolution for each single market within the energy industry. Some markets are more mature, while others are newer and require more regulation or experience from the authorities issuing the rules. As for the natural gas market concerns, in general terms, the government, SENER, and CRE need to continue implementing what was already in place. This means that they need to maintain in place the capacity-contracting scheme on the pipelines, promoting a secondary market and pushing the owners to relinquish capacity when it is not being used after considerable time. One of the key decisions taken after the reforms was to force PEMEX to release part of its portfolio of customers. That allowed new players to come in and compete in the market. If the government sticks to such regulation and leaves prices unrestricted, then we will have a vibrant market similar to an extension of the US gas market. </p><h4>Why do the new electricity tariffs play such a key role in the wellbeing of the electricity market in Mexico?</h4><p>In most electricity markets, a central theme is how the new tariffs are set. In Mexico regulated rates are basically the key signal for competitors of CFE to invest in the market. If the rates reflect what is going on in the market and CFE's costs as the basic service supplier, then we will see a great deal of investment. However, if the rates are subsidized in a way that goes against CFE's numbers or finances, then it will be difficult to have other players compete. This is why it is important for the government to realize that the auctions for renewables were extremely positive in terms of reducing electricity rates by means of competition in the provision of energy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why is it important for the country to increase its storage capacity to 10-12 days, the international average?</h4><p>Many countries face limitations in storage capacity for oil products, which is a key element in the value chain to secure the supply to the consumer, both on time and with the desired quality. Many variables can risk our supply lines, be it transport incapacity, bad weather, war, terrorism, contamination, sabotage, or lack of supply. If the system does not have enough storage capacity, there will most likely be critical shortages. The number of days of storage capacity each country needs depends on local crude availability, refining capacity, logistics system capacity, and financial resources. For example, countries that are members of the International Energy Agency have 90 days worth of net imports. Having between 1 and 3 days, which is the case of Mexico, is a huge risk. </p><h4>What added value does your company offer the industry in Mexico?</h4><p>The CLH Group has more than 90 years of experience in this sector, and adding value to the several stakeholders is our core pursuit. The group is focused only on the logistics industry, including operating pipelines, storage facilities, ports and airport tank farms, and providing plane refueling services. We have the objective of bringing all that value and knowledge to the country. Second, the CLH Group is financially healthy, which makes it possible to materialize investments in logistics assets. We are a not just an operator of infrastructure, but an investor with an operations background, a winning combination. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[gas-stations-40]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Which changes are you seeing as a result of companies embracing new technologies?</h4><p>The results depend on the amount of time in the implementation of the technologies. For example, in the automotive industry where technology is immersed in each of its processes, there is a fair amount of innovation, which helps achieve higher and higher incomes. These companies are already in industry 4.0 mode with innovation labs and creating patents for robotics or the use of new materials. In a rapidly changing industry like the automotive sector, these innovations are taking shape more quickly. New technologies are the vehicle for growth and permanence in the future. However, other industries are still in early stages where the application of technology is slower, the processes are less efficient, and their competitiveness is lower, which lowers incomes and even causes companies to disappear. Technologies such as AI, machine learning, IoT, and predictive data analysis allow companies to have a better understanding of customer needs, creating trust and loyalty to generate mutual benefits. HACSYS it a leader in digital transformation in the energy industry; we are currently participating in the Nuevo León 4.0 initiative to be an intelligent state. The most business in technology in Nuevo León is in IoT, manufacturing processes, and robotics. At HACSYS, we also see great potential in data analytics, predictive maintenance, and machine learning.</p><h4>What kind of investments are still needed in Mexico to boost the IT sector?</h4><p>Mexico needs to invest more in business angels and venture capital firms that invest in projects and offer experience, knowledge, and guidance to SMEs and research into new technology start-ups that can then be applied to industries that boost the patent inventory in Mexico. We need to bear in mind that most Mexican companies are SMEs, which are adaptive and can innovate and implement new changes. However, SMEs often do not have the financial muscle that larger companies do. Public investment in SMEs' digitalization should be encouraged, and access to bank credit should be eased. </p><h4>What is your view of the digitalization of the oil and gas sector?</h4><p>After the energy reform, the industry had to launch an intense transformation across many processes. The oil and gas sector must be digital in order to be competitive, and the arrival of new foreign brands has been a challenge for Mexican ones. The sector also needs to be transformed in order to implement new technologies that can meet regulations coming in place in January 2020. HACSYS is revolutionizing the oil and gas sector, and our 16 years of experience with our team of innovation experts have helped build the S3 Smart Service Station, converting them from a traditional to a multimodal model that can operate different product options (gas, oil, hydrogen, electricity). This model uses a whole new ecosystem of software that will help transform the service station to renewables over time. The main challenge in the digital transformation is building an ecosystem in which the government, companies, universities, and society can work together to technologically change Mexico. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why did DG Impianti decide to enter the Mexican oil and gas market when it did?</h4><p>DG Impianti decided to enter the Mexican market as part of its international business development strategy. For many years, the Mexican industry had closed its doors to private sector research, exploration, and production of hydrocarbons. The state later gave foreign companies an opportunity to enter the market. We consider this to be important, as it demonstrates many areas of opportunities. Mexico has great potential in the production of oil and gas and has favorable political and environmental conditions, in addition to its excellent diplomatic relations with Italy. We are committed to investing in the long term, which means investing in our people and their knowledge and capital. We see human capital as an indispensable and fundamental part of our work. That is why wherever we operate, we commit to acting with respect, honesty, and integrity. When we enter new countries, we do it not only to develop our capabilities, but also to develop the country and locals' capabilities and combine and integrate our capabilities with the ones of the country we are working in. In Mexico, we want to enrich ourselves as well as the country, which is possible only if we expand within it. We believe that in Mexico—as well as other countries such as Kazakhstan, the UAE, and the Congo—we can set up a system that can be perfectly integrated into the local system.</p><h4>What strategies is DG Impianti using in Italy and abroad to mitigate the risks of oil prices dropping?</h4><p>As a result of the company's skills and the experience it has built up over its 52-year history, DG has been able to tackle this uncertainty. All oil companies have had to deal with a fall in the price per barrel from USD140-130 to USD50 and thus review their strategies. DG has also developed a strategy to reduce the time to market from exploration to production. This required an optimization of the systems, an impeccable organization and management, and a reassessment of the production processes within DG, from engineering to procurement, logistics, and construction. DG stressed the importance of valuing the strengths and growth potential and capabilities of its personnel with the final aim of developing its projects more rapidly and accelerating processes while still maintaining the same quality and safety.</p><h4>What added value does DG offer its partners in Mexico?</h4><p>Our greatest added value is our ability to provide services in efficiency and accountability for a wide range of processes. This translates into greater strength in all phases of the process—engineering, procurement, and construction—and an acceleration of all aspects that contribute to the realization of a project. What we offer is speed, efficiency, and accountability. Over its 50-year history, DG has had the opportunity to completely settle into the oil market, from onshore to the offshore sector and from the moment of exploration to production. DG perfectly understands the development of the oil industry, including the structure and operational logistics. We have an extremely well-developed multidisciplinary engineering capacity of developing both offshore platforms and its processes. This same know-how can be used for both on and offshore projects. An extremely strong core in the sector of project management services that allows us to manage the whole project—from engineering to procurement and logistics until construction—is of great value here.</p><h4>What type of projects are you collaborating with in Mexico?</h4><p>We are currently engaged in a fast-track and important project with one of the most important oil companies in the world. Our client has an ambitious project, and we have been able to supply an excellent service. They sought to set up a plant to treat oil, its first project realized in Mexico, within a challenging time frame of 12 months. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your current perspective on the Mexican oil industry?</h4><p>Mexico has a bright future because it has a lot of resources. We have identified significant areas that are under explored, under invested, and underdeveloped. This presents a fantastic opportunity for whoever comes to invest in Mexico. The results of the private sector, since the energy reform began, have simply been fantastic. Most of the fields offered in offshore Round 1 turned out to be much bigger than originally expected, some up to seven times more, and every offshore exploration well has been successful. Now we will start to see the second round of wells being drilled, which I predict will be even better.</p><h4>What are today's biggest opportunities in the Mexican oil industry?</h4><p>Opportunities are diverse, and there is room for everybody. Starting with deep-water exploration, there are huge areas that have been untapped and that are likely to contain huge amounts of oil. That is a business for big companies. Then you go to the south east, to the shallow water areas, where you have three private successful projects. Additional exploration wells will also be drilled in 2019 that are likely to bring results. Then, you have the onshore opportunities, mostly fields held by PEMEX that are waiting for investment. It seems that such onshore areas will be limited under the current administration for operators, but will probably be available for service companies. There is room for everybody: large, medium, and small companies, as well as for contractors.</p><h4>What offshore advances has the group participated in recently?</h4><p>Citla participates in four offshore blocks. Three of them are associated with round 2.1, of which one was awarded in round 3.1. In two of them, Blocks 7 and 9 of round 2.1, we have commitment wells, two in each block. Meanwhile, in the other two blocks, we do not have drilling commitments for now. We have done a tremendous amount of work in the four blocks. We are fortunate to work with world-class operators. Citla is the only private Mexican company that has had a joint venture with a major oil company. That says a lot about our capabilities and financial strength. We are fortunate to work with ENI, an Italian oil company, in two of our fields. We are also proud to work with Cairn, an independent British exploration company. They were successful first in India, and more lately in Senegal and the North Sea. This year we are planning to start drilling one well in Block 9 and another in Block 7. And we may start a second well in Block 9 if everything goes well before year-end. Taken together we will have drilled in two blocks by the end of 2019. Depending on the results, we will define what we will do in 2020. </p><h4>How much are you investing in drilling and exploration in 2019?</h4><p>Each of these wells ranged in cost between USD40-60 million, depending on the depth, but we have fantastic investors. Firstly, we have ACON Investments, which holds around 65% of Citla. They act on behalf of a number of funds and investors, including Mexican pension funds. We also have reputed institutions such as the IFC, which is the World Bank's branch that invests in equity. The IFC also manages a Citla investor fund called the China-Mexico Fund, which includes development banks from both China and Mexico. We are grateful for having such quality investors that are active in contributing and have significant resources. In the case of ACON, they bring experience in the oil and gas sector in the US and South America. The IFC also has significant investments in oil and gas around the world and are great champions of high environmental and social standards. That is tremendously valuable and a strong part of our identity. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why did Shell decide to enter Mexico's deep-water industry?</h4><p>We decided to do this for several reasons. The most important being that Shell is a leader in deep-water development and exploration around the world. Second, Mexico offered the right opportunity for us to come and participate in this particular area. We produce nearly 1 million bpd from deep water globally. From the bids that took place in 2018, we were able to secure a significant footprint in Mexico. We currently have 11 blocks in the upstream sector. We operate 10 out of the 11 blocks, nine of which are in deep water. We operate in the US as well, and had been exploring the US Gulf of Mexico for some time when we thought it was high time to explore the Mexican side too. </p><h4>What strategies is the company using to maintain its ambitious drilling plan from now till 2020 in Mexico?</h4><p>We would like to start drilling by the end of 2019. Recently we obtained the regulatory exploration approval from the National Hydrocarbons Commission. Hereinafter, we have to put forward the drilling plan application. We also obtained the environmental approvals that go along with that. There is still some logistics planning needed to support the operation. It is like a big jigsaw puzzle. We are continuing to evaluate, and as the date approaches will be working more on the actual drilling. It is about having everything in place to move forward. In 2020, Mexico is big on our global radar. In fact, Mexico could be the place where we drill the largest number of wells. Toward this end, we will have a large exploration campaign in 2020. This is the beginning of a busy four-year schedule for Shell in Mexico. Our operations in Mexico are set to become the fastest we have drilled anywhere. Also, this will be our biggest exploration campaign in 2019 because it's quite significant for Shell as a group. It shows the long-term commitment, we have for Mexico and our understanding of the country's need for speedy investments and new infrastructure.</p><h4>What characteristics do you look for in a company before deciding to collaborate with it in a consortium?</h4><p>Looking at our history, all our collaborations are specific in terms of geography and time. We recognize the value of partnering with others. Shell partners with national oil companies around the world. Similarly, we participated with PEMEX in two previous bid rounds.</p><h4>What is your outlook on the delay of licensing rounds from the new administration?</h4><p>The President of Mexico has been clear in terms of evaluating the success of this model before moving forward with new bid rounds. We have been engaged in a very productive dialogue with the new government and are hopeful the results of the work carried out by Shell and other companies will be sufficient to help the president and his government make the best decision. It is in the best interest of Mexico that we discover and produce as much hydrocarbons as we can. We already see signs of investment and the number of wells the industry is committed to drill. The National Hydrocarbons Commission has already approved 331 wells, which shows the commitment we have made as an industry to seriously move forward. In all, AMEXHI, the Mexican Association of Hydrocarbon Companies, is producing around 31,000bpd, and by the end of this government we believe we can produce around 280,000bpd. We are already seeing results, which is quite remarkable considering the long-term nature of the industry. </p><h4>What are your proposals for the National Development Plan?</h4><p>We are focused on increasing production through more bid rounds, strengthening PEMEX, having more farm outs, and improving infrastructure. We also stressed the need for government support in terms of engaging communities with social programs. These must also be in line with the president's objectives of simplifying processes and reducing bureaucracy. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What major projects will the CRE be focusing on in 2019?</h4><p>For 2019, one of our main projects will be collective distributed power generation, which is similar to Uber, but for solar panels. This raises the collective ownership of a solar panel on a roof. For example, one building could have a solar panel to provide energy to the whole neighborhood. This energy model allows this building to provide other buildings, small businesses, and homes with energy. They could pay for the transportation of energy and still benefit from lower prices. The CRE is working on this regulatory piece. Furthermore, when combined with technology, such as blockchain and other collaborative economies, distributed power generation could bring new business models to the market. Another important issue is the use of energy storage in Mexico. We are working on this regulation and started in 2019 with modest regulations for what storage means. The definition was vague and unclear in international practice. With the storage of electricity, in the future it will be possible to offer many products, for example, power or distribution. We decided to define it as the storage of electricity itself, whether it be fuel or otherwise. There is a next generation of regulation that will come in terms of describing each of the services that storage provides. Currently, there are 17 or 20 different services. We have to try to allocate the new vision of the president into our work by helping as much as we can in terms of building energy sufficiency. Defining electricity storage is also important to stop the use of dangerous forms of fuel. Even though 98% of the population has electricity in their homes, if you look at the fuel they use for cooking or heating water, the presence of good fuel is only 75%-80%. About 11% of households in Mexico are still using wood. With permission from CRE, the same channels of distribution could be used to ensure people get good fuel instead of wood. We want to set up regulation that makes it easy for small storage facilities to comply with regulations.</p><h4>How can Mexico assure investors about their projects, considering the recent governmental cancellations?</h4><p>Every government cancels and goes through a process of surveying the policies that were implemented by previous governments. I have been part of five changes in government and seen this every time. During the last administration, while I was in the Ministry of Energy, the minister cancelled the Ramones pipeline because he wanted to review the process himself, before ultimately restarting it. We have to remember that this is legitimate and is something that happens all over the world. There will be some minor modifications in terms of having a stronger PEMEX, but that is public policy and something the government will justify on its own terms. </p><h4>What changes will the Energy Reform go through in the next six years? </h4><p>All of the energy liberties we have enjoyed since the reform are still intact, and there are public declarations by the main actors specifying that the constitution will not be amended, at least not in the next three years. We are giving the reforms the chance to prove they work. More than 50 new solar plants are now in operation in Mexico. For example, more than 65% of the capacity of the first electricity bid is now in operation, not to mention 20% of the second. The third bid is still in development, but will become a reality if we allow it the time it needs. The tools may change somehow, but what is more important is to try to strengthen state-owned companies. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Upon taking office, newly elected Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador promised to revive an economic sector that has long been a source pride for Mexicans: the petroleum industry. To much dismay, national oil production has fallen by half since it peaked at 3.4 million barrels of crude per day in 2004, when Mexico was the world's fourth-largest producer. </p><p>As of January 2019, the country fell to 12th in global oil production rankings as the national oil company, Petróleos Mexicanos, or PEMEX, produced just 1.62 million bpd, its lowest crude output on record. The news was ill received by many as Mexico hosts some of the world's largest oil reserves, but production has decreased for 14 consecutive years due to poor infrastructure, lack of investment and broader management issues at PEMEX. </p><p>Now President AMLO, as he is commonly known, is acting fast to reverse the trend, directing state funds towards the most productive, established oil fields and laying out plans for new refineries that he says will help meet national energy needs while providing thousands of high-paying jobs. After years of mismanagement that have forced Mexico to import an increasing amount of its oil from the United States, AMLO has pledged to boost the nation's crude production to 2.6 million bpd by the end of his six-year term in 2024.</p><p>Among his first moves was to rebrand PEMEX with a new slogan, “For the rescue of sovereignty," in a nod to the important role oil production has played for the nation's development. AMLO has also outlined plans to build an USD8 billion oil refinery in his home state of Tabasco, in the city of Dos Bocas. The project, which was approved via a controversial referendum, was a central theme of his presidential campaign, but will be years in the making, prompting the new administration to seek out more immediate solutions to reduce the country's current dependence on imported energy.</p><p>To address short-term oil demand, Mexico's National Hydrocarbons Commission (CNH) has approved a USD339-million development plan for the Cheek shallow oil fields in Campeche Bay. Discovered in 2015, the project comprises 20 oil fields, of which four are on land and 16 are offshore wells that together are projected to produce 18.68 million barrels through 2030. According to CNH Commissioner Alma América Porres Luna, the bulk of petroleum output would take place in the next few years, surpassing 18,000bpd by 2020 before falling to 2,000bpd in 2024. The Cheek reserve is “not considered a very large field, but it can contribute toward rapidly increasing production," Porres Luna said.</p><p>Meanwhile, PEMEX has received state approval to develop three additional fields—the Xikin, Chocol and Esah—which together with the Cheek are expected to boost the nation's oil output by 73,000bpd by the end of 2020. “In 2019 the primary goal for PEMEX is to halt the decline in our crude oil production," Alberto Velázquez, chief financial officer for PEMEX, said. “We are still some ways from achieving our goal. It is important to note that the uptick we expect in production would occur during the fourth quarter of 2019, when our 20 new fields start producing."</p><p>Though such plans have drawn criticism for their relatively short production cycles, state officials are making use of established, smaller oil reserves to decrease imports as new oil production hubs are developed. Long-term challenges will inevitably stem from PEMEX's USD107 billion debt, which makes it the most indebted oil company in the world. A combination of mismanagement and corruption have left the company's refineries working at just one third of their capacity, and the state's tax codes diverts a significant sum of the company's profits.</p><p>AMLO said he will continue to restructure the bureaucracy that has stifled production and innovation at PEMEX and has also begun cracking down on rampant oil theft, in which criminal gangs have been siphoning petroleum and gasoline from the nation's pipeline network. If the president can implement his vision to restore at least some of Mexico's oil output, the country will be able to wean itself off US petroleum imports, which have tripled from USD10.4 billion in 2008 to a record high of USD30.5 billion in 2018. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What steps does Mexico need to take to become an energy hub for Europe and Latin America?</h4><p>Mexico has the privilege of being located between two oceans. We share a gas reservoir with the US, and with geopolitics changing the world, our access to the sea offers us the opportunity to begin exporting hydrocarbons to all of it. However, this is theoretical at the moment; in order to fulfill its potential, the country needs to realize that extracting hydrocarbons is a technical challenge, not just a political one. Countries such as Venezuela have shown that simply being willing to do something is not enough to actually get it done. One of the benefits of the Energy Reform is the opportunity to learn from private companies that have been successful across the globe. Having their knowledge in Mexico is an important advantage. New reforms have allowed us to attract new investment, extract hydrocarbons, and export. Everyone would like to start from the beginning; however, time has passed, and we need to catch up faster, making as few mistakes as possible.</p><h4>What role does GDI play in increasing efficiency?</h4><p>Over the past 10 years, we have learned how to address the complexity of the Mexican market and realize that each region and state differs wildly from the rest. There are different ecosystems from Oaxaca to Sonora and Yucatán to Baja California, not just in terms of the environment, but also as communities. The country has grown and cannot only have two or three days of hydrocarbon storage; it now needs at least 15. Moreover, hydrocarbon logistics are not well defined in the country. My guess is that Mexico will go through what the US did over 70 years ago: we will start developing new storage tank facilities and, after that, new infrastructure projects for the pipeline system, which is one of our specialties.</p><h4>What are some of the actions GDI is taking in hydrocarbons energy storage?</h4><p>The country has an incredible amount of potential to expand its pipeline network from 15,000km to 30,000km. This is due to the liberalization of the price of gasoline and the huge costs the country had to absorb because of it. With new infrastructure and the added oil inventories, people will have to be more dynamic, thinking about prices more than a month in advance, and becoming more connected with the global economy. When one is not subsidized, they have to be proactive. For long-term projects of 10-15 years, the country needs to focus on creating a great and solid rule of law that allows investors to understand what lies ahead.</p><h4>Considering that for 70 years PEMEX was the country's only oil client, what have been the challenges of transitioning to a multi-company system?</h4><p>The challenge is to educate our customers on what Mexico is truly like. Many new reforms were enacted in the past six years, and many in Mexico do not exactly know what they mean for the country. We need to learn fast and execute even faster. It requires a great deal of training and adapting to what is needed at the moment. The country also has to incorporate innovation quickly and adopt social media and new communication processes. We have to teach the community how to benefit from the reforms, and in order to do that, we need to adapt to the needs of foreign clients as well as changing internal needs.</p><h4>What differentiates GDI from newer or foreign companies entering the market?</h4><p>One differentiator is that we are a Mexican company. We are a contractor focused on oil and gas and truly understand the market. We have acquired a great amount of experience in developing oil and gas infrastructure for private companies over the past seven years, which has given us extensive insight. Being a transparent contractor, adding value to the community, and getting projects done on time is what we have been working toward every day. Our clients will always find us working hard to make things happen. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[USD300 million invested in Nigeria]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[jejin-jeon-managing-director-samsung-heavy-industries-nigeria]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How important is the Egina project within Samsung's global portfolio?</h4><p>Egina is the first and largest floating oil production facility since the NOGICD Act of 2010, which mandates certain levels of operations that must be carried out in country. For Nigeria, the importance of Egina was that the country received a beautiful, modern fabrication and integration yard. That facility was the first-ever production facility Samsung built and invested in the African continent, so that was the important for us as a group. Through the Egina project, we made our footprint in Africa, and it was a stepping stone toward expanding our business in Sub-Saharan Africa. As a result of the project, Nigeria now does not have to go to Europe or Asia  for fabrication and integration works, a huge win for local content.</p><h4>Where do you see further opportunities for growth for Samsung in Nigeria?</h4><p>We made an investment of almost USD300 million in Nigeria because of the country's potential for growth in the oil and gas industry. The global oil and gas industry had been suffering, with no major, large-scale oil and gas projects for the last five or six years. Nigeria's daily oil production fell from 2 million bpd to around 1.3 million. As crude oil represents almost 90% of government revenues in Nigeria, the falling oil production resulted in a severe economic recession. Together with next project, Bonga South West, these two projects cover the gap with around 350,000-380,000bopd. Egina alone represents 200,000 bopd, while Bonga South West will produce around 150,000-180,000bpd. With these two, Nigeria can increase its oil production rate from 1.3 million bpd to around 1.7 million. Therefore, these are critical projects for the Nigerian economy, which is why the government encouraged foreign investors with technology such as Samsung to come to Nigeria. During the Egina project, we set up a welding qualification center in our facility, one of the most advanced welding academies in Nigeria, and through this training school we have educated at no cost almost 600 young male and female welders who received international welding certificates, making the Egina project important also for educating local content.</p><h4>What challenges did you have to contend with in executing the project?</h4><p>The Nigerian content issue has been a challenge; there are still several companies with no adequate facilities, equipment, or expertise; however, because of the Nigeria Content Act, we were unable to use international contractors. We gave a great deal of work to Nigerian companies, though a certain number could not deliver the products within the budget and also under schedule. Nevertheless, this is a process, and we are pleased to be part of it and are committed to further developing local content. We will still work with some local companies that disappointed us and will encourage them to develop themselves in the course of the next project.</p><h4>Many African countries are making great advancements in their exploration of oil and gas. How is Nigeria competing in terms of investment attractiveness?</h4><p>There are only a few countries that can be compared to Nigeria; Tanzania and Mozambique are now rising markets in gas production. We have a contract with ENI together with INP and ENH, the Mozambique national oil and gas company. Mozambique, however, is still incomparable to Nigeria, in terms of oil &amp; gas related infrastructure and statutory regulation for oil and gas as well. It needs to update it and is still in the initial stage of the learning curve. In Nigeria, there are many opportunities and challenges at the same time, though there is a long enough history in oil and gas expertise. It makes sense to invest in Nigeria, as it is the center of the ECOWAS countries; once we have facilities here, we can also cover other Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) countries including Ghana, Cameroon, Senegal, and Ivory Coast.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Samsung in 2020?</h4><p>2020 will be a meaningful year for Samsung. Our first investment was in 2013, and in 2019 we will fully deliver and finish our contractual obligation for the Egina project. We are waiting for another big project with Bonga South West, though such a large-scale project can only come into the market once per every five to six years. That is why we are also working on several small and medium scale projects that are in between 500 and 5,000 metric tons of steel works. Such work is of less interest to our headquarters; however, this facility in Nigeria is also able to accommodate such scale of steel works. In addition, this yard is well designed and developed to support the big projects of our headquarters.</p><h4>In light of your current litigation case with your local partner LADOL, what is your outlook for 2020?</h4><p>There was a clear breach in the agreement between Samsung and our local partner, LADOL, as well as violation of the Nigerian law from its side. However, thanks to the government's intervention in the case, our partner realized it is in serious trouble. We have just started our negotiation with LADOL in parallel with arbitration process in London and hope to continue our operation of our yard without interruptions, leading to more opportunity from potential clients. Once there are no uncertainties in our investment, the Samsung Group headquarters will realize that Nigeria and its government are reliable. Our outlook for 2020 much depends on the outcome of this arbitration process. If we lose our assets without our material defaults, then our group will definitely lose trust and interest in Nigeria, which will result in no more investment. However, if the case resolves in our favor, backed by clear legal and administrative counter-measure, we will have greater trust in Nigeria and its government and will continue to make our investments including the ship repair business, which is extremely promising in Nigeria as the leading oil and gas player in Sub-Saharan Africa. If everything goes well, we will keep being committed to the further growth of Nigeria and its people as well.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Transforming Mobility in Jeddah]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[dr-osama-bin-ibrahim-abdouh-ceo-metro-jeddah-company]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you walk us through the evolution of your operations over the past few years?</h4><p>In line with Vision 2030, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) with the strategic goal to implement the Public Transportation Programs in the Kingdom. This initiative will help cities in moving large numbers of people safely, quickly, reliably, in a cleaner environment and at affordable cost. Metro Jeddah Company (MJC) is responsible for implementing Jeddah Public Transportation Program (JPTP). JPTP is an essential and important transportation and city-development initiative for Jeddah. It focuses on developing mass rapid transit as a core mobility option in a multi-modal transportation system that will help Jeddah continue to grow towards a prosperous and sustainable future. JPTP components includes Metro lines, LRT, Corniche Tramway, Bus Network, Water Ferries, Obhur Creek Bridge and a Multimodal Station. MJC has completed Preliminary Engineering Design and Tender Documents for all these modes of transportation using Design &amp; Build (EPC) approach. However with the shift in strategic direction and to look for alternate finance and private sector participation in economic development, MJC has embarked to implement JPTP with PPP procurement approach. Currently, we are working with our Transaction Advisors to complete four transactions, viz-a-viz Bus Network Project Phase 1, Obhur Creek Bridge, Water Taxis and Development of Corniche Tram. These four transactions will be rolled out to the market in same order. JPTP has the potential to transform the urban landscape of Jeddah and provide vastly improved transportation to a substantial population in Jeddah for decades into the future.</p><h4>Why are you starting with the bus package, and what are the operational implications following the tender announcement?</h4><p>We are using incremental delivery of benefits approach and the Bus Public Transportation component as initial stage of the long term public transportation strategy for Jeddah. The Bus Network Project will provide a sound basis and initial step in developing a sustainable urban transport outcome for Jeddah that has sufficient travel demand and overall public market share to merit Jeddah Bus Network project. Also, the Bus Network Project is more than just a physical investment, it is transformative and meeting the needs of Jeddah's residents. The bus project requires less initial Capital Expenditure (CapEx) and allow faster delivery of initial public transport enhancement for the city. We will be facing similar challenges for modal shift (mode share) like other global public transportation systems during early days of commercial operations and these challenges will overcome by introducing policies to encourage use of public transport.</p><h4>What are the main challenges faced during the design phase you are currently in, and what is your strategy to overcome them?</h4><p>MJC has assembled and mobilized multi-disciplinary professional resources from globally premier consultant's for Pre-Program Management and Technical Peer Design Review/Checking, for Jeddah Public Transportation Master Plan (JPMTP) and Preliminary Engineering Design and for Architectural Competition, Design, Branding and Way Finding and has delivered Preliminary Design of a global integrated public transportation program, innovative and sustainable, meeting the high-level requirements. This JPTP program, through its magnitude, its complexity, expected improvement of Jeddah Transport, is a World premiere. The JPTP program was also complex because of the necessary coordination of many different pre-program management, engineering and architectural teams, and working in parallel on, among others: town planning, rail alignment, geotechnics, hydrology, tunnel, viaduct, foundations, utilities relocation, architecture, electro-mechanical, signaling, telecoms, power supply, automatic train control, fare collection, maintenance workshop, and network operation. To meet the deliverables deadlines, MJC had to ensure a very effective coordination and using partnering approach between MJC and the consultants and the different teams based in different locations Jeddah, London.and Paris, in particular through dedicated on-line collaborative tools. The program was organized by modes of transportation (packages), with a strong coordination team ensuring proper interfaces and consistent approaches between the modes. The team leading every single package first prepared a detailed work breakdown schedule and the associated work planning. The timely availability of the input data coming from Jeddah Municipality was key: geotechnical data, topographical survey data, building condition survey, existing utilities, existing roads, etc… In terms of geotechnical data, boreholes in strategic areas were prioritized in order to provide the design team with the necessary inputs for them to define, in particular, the type of tunnel. The entire program of drilling was then carried out in a sequence coordinated with the design team. All the program interfaces with external projects (roads/development…) were captured in a dedicated matrix, in order to ensure a full traceability and on-time coordination between the field teams and the design teams. Dozens of meetings with external stakeholders were set up in Jeddah to get inputs in a timely manner so as not to delay the preliminary design. We integrated 40 young Saudi graduates who bring the knowledge of the local context to the team, and we ensured that Robust Change Management and Configuration Management were implemented to trace the changes at the earliest to minimize abortive works. The overall schedule required just-in-time planning, lean construction philosophy, and concurrent engineering approach that needed a very strict weekly follow-up of the progress. Considering the amount of documents to handle, large and dedicated document control teams were mobilized, in Jeddah, London, and in Paris, and a single program level Electronic Document Management Systems (EDMS) known as Proliance was implemented.</p><h4>What are the salient technological aspects of this masterplan?</h4><p>JPTP is an integrated multimodal public transportation system and during design and implementation leverage is based on technological aspect such as concurrent engineering, EDMS, 3D BIM model and Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS). The multimodal transportation modes are coordinated through an integrated travel network management and integrated operations control center (ICC). Integrated and automated fare collection system, applications for travel planning, and real-time travel updates. JPTP is using technology that feature a uniform brand and symbol for easy recognition by travelers. In addition, during planning and design phases, MJC is keen to discuss updated technological solutions available in the market or expected to evolve in the future.</p><h4>What are the main aspects that need to be considered when financing a transportation project?</h4><p>Financing public transportation systems is complicated and challenging globally and finance or fund availability is vital to develop any public transportation infrastructure project. Though several factors need to be considered while financing transportation infrastructure and some of them are project specific business case and business model, source of funding, financial instrument, avoiding capital cost subsidy, amount of revenues (fare box and non-fare box), subsidy size, keeping capital and operational cost minimum, assets and age of assets, avoiding preferential treatment for few financial investors and regulatory policies.</p><h4>What approach would you suggest to overcome the challenge of overreliance on direct revenue generation to approve the project's financial model?</h4><p>Project financial model output is used in cost benefit analysis or economic feasibility of project and in performing financial analysis. Beside merely depending on generation of revenues (direct and indirect) in approving financial model of a project, the assessor or interrogator of financial model shall look into inputs such as capital cost, operating cost, service cost, finance cost, escalation rate and general assumptions made in the model. Additionally element of all the social benefits translated into monetary value and government guarantees, tax exemption or reduction, certainty of revenue stream, termination compensation, incentive for new market penetration and subsidies plays an important role in project financial model. As a guide a project financial model can be approve if it shows that it covers operating cost and debt service expenses over tenure of debt.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What factors have helped Sasil remain a dynamic player in the consumer goods market despite a competitive environment?</h4><p>Sasil participates in the detergents and soaps industry in a significant way, and we have a solid position in that segment. While the market is mostly dominated by multinationals, Sasil is a 100% Mexican company. The effort for us to reach more households has not been easy, and we have thrived by always looking for business niches. We do what logic dictates within a business of this type. For example, there are raw materials that we can only obtain abroad, which is why we are obliged to export to maintain a healthy commercial balance. The industry of detergents and cleaning grows constantly, and we have managed to expand to the US, Central America, and the Caribbean.</p><h4>How do these two markets—the US and the Caribbean and Central American region—respond to Mexican brands?</h4><p>The American market is extremely particular. We entered the American market through Mexican residents who tend to concentrate in particular regions. These people were looking for Mexican products, so the competition was not against American products, but with other Mexican products in the US. However, we took a step forward in terms of reaching these communities and letting them know which of our products were available in their supermarkets. Mexican companies tend to export to this region given the proximity. We are closer to the Caribbean than to Tijuana, and Mexico is an important country for many countries in the Caribbean. The quality of Mexican products always stands out in that region. Mexican brands there are aspirational, while in the US they are not.</p><h4>What trends do you see in the detergent market as consumers become more environmentally conscious?</h4><p>The detergent powder market is massive. Local production in Mexico is more than 1.5 million tons a year; however, there is a tendency to consume liquids because they are friendlier to the environment, though these require a washing machine. In Mexico, many do not have washing machines and have to use powder. Therefore, liquids will continue to gain more market share as eco-friendliness and the penetration of washing machines in Mexican households become more prominent. </p><h4>How would you assess consumer confidence at the moment in Mexico?</h4><p>Mexico has a new administration, and it is still too early to say what will happen. We have grown consistently in previous years compared to 2018, though it is not necessarily a consequence of a government change. When there are competitive prices, people buy more. There are important factors that must be considered. A significant share of the costs of many production companies in Mexico is in dollars. If the dollar is unstable, and the exchange rate is unfavorable, we will face difficult times. Some of our raw materials are derived from petroleum, which also fluctuates. Given this context, finding new markets of revenue remains a priority for us. We want to export more to the countries we already export to and export to more countries. We plan to export more volume to the US and are achieving it. This is an important factor in keeping us in favorable conditions. We have reached sophisticated markets, including Europe. The company is heading toward its 30th year, and we want to continue with the same enthusiasm. The growth of the company has been exponential, and today we have a production capacity of 250,000 tons per year. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will the change in vision of the administration impact doing business in Mexico?</h4><p>There is no question this government will be different from any of Mexico's previous ones. We have had other transitions such as at the end of the 1990s, when the government changed parties for the first time in 70 years. The government has gone back and forth between these two parties (PRI and PAN) since then, though this election is different. It is starting to become fairly evident that the emphasis on social aspects will be significantly stronger in the new administration. That is in fact beneficial in many ways, and we are excited to see how this new program to help young people works out. We are extremely involved in it and excited to help make it work and offer something that will contribute to creating more employment in the country; however, it is still too early to see how things will go.</p><h4>In what ways will the renegotiation of NAFTA affect the economy?</h4><p>We are currently concerned about how willing this new administration will be in continuing to strengthen the openness of the Mexican economy; however, the fact that the new president had the opportunity to state that he is not in favor of a new free trade agreement during the NAFTA renegotiations but did not is extremely encouraging. It would be hard to imagine a growing economy that can achieve its full potential without being open, especially in the 21st century. </p><h4>What global trends is the company foreseeing to change demand for its products?</h4><p>Adult care products will be the product of the future because many economies in the world are rapidly aging. Japan is the first country in the world today that sells more adult than baby diapers. Advances in medicine and technology help extend people's lives from their early 80s to their 90s and even 100s. People are also more environmentally aware and active than before, and we are helping our clients such as McDonalds reduce their carbon footprint and meet consumer needs by offering non-bleached napkins. If one does not innovate, you can't succeed. </p><h4>What is your future vision for the company and expansion goals for the next year?</h4><p>We will focus on growth, growth, and more growth. We still have opportunities in the markets we cover and will continue to innovate our current portfolio while actively looking for opportunities to expand it. In the last three years, Kimberly-Clark Mexico has done well in the soaps segment, which no other Kimberly-Clark company has achieved in the world. We are the leader in liquid soaps in Mexico, and this sector is growing the most. Despite the challenges before us, we are upbeat because Mexico continues to be one of the most exciting opportunities in the world. It has a large and growing middle class that participates more every day, and people are ready to continue growing and find ways of making our country better. We have major challenges and, at the same time, major opportunities and the ability to find solutions to our problems and take advantage of these opportunities. We are multi-channel and multi-sector and offer products to both the consumer as well as professional sector, namely hotels, offices, and the McDonald's of the world. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main advantages that Mexico offers DuPont as its international business strategy?</h4><p>DuPont's first subsidiary outside of the US was in Mexico. We have been here continuously for 94 years. We know how to do business in Mexico and around the world. We see two advantages in Mexico. One is logistics; we not only have access to North America, but we have two oceans. The treaty we have with the US and Canada, combined with those we have in Asia and Europe, helps us in a way that makes our costs competitive. We are bringing raw materials into the country. Kevlar has been on the market for 40 years, and now we are producing new types in terms of colors, and we are bringing all of this into Mexico. All our customers will have the same services, the same product and innovation that you can find in Asia or in Europe. This is really helping us. We are transforming our culture to focus more on the customer.</p><h4>What are your production goals in Mexico?</h4><p>DuPont is truly globalized. The beauty of this means we can now bring into Mexico any technology being used around the world. Our business today is not in volume, but more in margin and innovation. The investment in plants is completely different, as is financial formula. We have a big plant in Mexico where we export more than 80% of the pectin that is produced. The product we make is used as an emulsifier for dairy products. We are exporting not only to North America and Europe, but to Asia as well, where consumption of dairy products is growing.</p><h4>What are your strategies for consolidating your presence in Mexico and the region?</h4><p>We are planning to continue to have a significant presence in the region. Our largest company in the region right now is Mexico. It is around 37% of the new DuPont. Brazil represents around 33%. We have presences in Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Brazil, and Mexico, as well as a small operation in Peru. We cover all of Latin America from these countries. We are planning for USD22 billion in revenue globally, of which Latin America will be 7%. This is an odd year because of the merger, so we have had to be careful with our expectations. What we are doing as the new DuPont is developing local customers and new markets. We are not just looking at global companies but local companies in Latin America. In Argentina, we have a huge local company that produces food. We have laboratories in Brazil and Mexico for nutrition and biosciences. When you are a specialty company, every dollar counts. It is not about volume, but what value you can bring to customers on a tailor-made basis. This one-on-one approach locally has been very successful. We are also changing our image, which is why we have new offices. We invested almost USD9 million in our office in Mexico City in 2019. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What opportunities has the company identified in Mexico's petrochemical industry?</h4><p>Our company was created after a government initiative to develop the petrochemical sector through an auction of 18 contracts with a duration of 20 years. After winning the auction, we decided to invest USD5 billion in the country because we believe in Mexico and have identified important drivers and potential in its petrochemical industry. The country's geographical position is a plus, along with its FTAs with many countries. The service and labor available here are also prime. In all, the petrochemical industry in Mexico moves around USD60 billion a year. Around 60-70% of what we produce is consumed by the Mexican market, and we export the rest to more than 46 countries, particularly the US, Europe, and Central America. Our success in Mexico proves Latin America's potential to encompass projects of this size. We are pleased with not only the financial results but also the relationships we have been able to establish with our clients.</p><h4>Who are your main clients in the country?</h4><p>We are in the middle of the plastic supply chain; therefore, our clients are a blend of companies that transform raw material to final products. We serve a variety of sectors from agriculture to packaging and automotive, among other industries that utilize plastic. The wide scope of the petrochemical industry makes it such a relevant sector in the country's economy.</p><h4>In what ways is the consumption of plastic increasing rapidly in Mexico?</h4><p>All around the world, the consumption of plastic is increasing rapidly. There are many new necessities we have to consider, especially in the US due to the shale gas phenomenon. In China and Asia, we observe a transitional moment as a result of the tariff war between US and China. Demand is growing rapidly, not only in the US but also in Asia. We are optimistic about our global vision for the future of this industry.</p><h4>How is the company promoting a more ecological use and handling of plastic?</h4><p>This is a highly relevant issue, and we are concerned about the amount of plastic waste accumulating in the ocean due to a lack of action. Plastic can truly improve the quality of people's lives, but people must collectively learn to use it wisely. As part of the industry, we feel a responsibility toward the government and society in general to promote better waste handling. The company is thus focused on increasing the reuse and recycling of products and is committed to educating society on the responsible handling of plastic. The main driver of change will ultimately revolve around education, especially within families and schools. Chemical associations around the world are participating in and developing movements on these matters. The idea is to take advantage of the pros that plastic can offer and minimize the impact through reutilization. We also want to promote the use of technology to efficiently use natural resources and avoid waste, which also helps minimize water consumption. We want to take advantage of our global outreach to create an impact. Braskem Idesa is equally promoting initiatives to develop plastic from renewable materials such as sugarcane.</p><h4>What are your production expansion plans in Mexico?</h4><p>We are committed to staying in the country long term. We are also always seeking opportunities for expansion and will likely start by expanding our platform and complex. This can be achieved through small investments that increase our total production capacity. We are also looking into expanding our portfolio and the types of polyethylene we produce for clients.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What industries has Evonik identified as key in Mexico?</h4><p>Today, we have a major presence in a wide variety of sectors such as mining, automotive, and the animal nutrition and health business. The company has also identified further opportunities for growth in personal and household care, dental care, aerospace, pharmaceuticals, coatings, and oil and gas segments. The automotive industry is an interesting area of opportunity for us because our presence in the sector coincides with many of our business lines, which allows us to offer an integrated approach. The same goes for oil, gas, and aerospace. Evonik is working with the Mexican authorities and regulatory institutions to implement new technologies that can support the production and development of gas pipes. When it comes to aerospace, Querétaro has one of the fastest-growing hubs in the world today. It is roughly a USD20-billion industry in Mexico to whom Evonik can provide a wide variety of solutions. As a global company, we benefit from seeing many of our global accounts in Mexico and setting up assets here. They want Evonik to support their business in Mexico the same way we do in other regions.</p><h4>How does doing business in Mexico differ from other markets?</h4><p>One of the biggest differences in Mexico is that many global players and key regional accounts invest more in local R&amp;D in comparison to their investments in other emerging countries, especially those involved with industries connected to manufacturing. This also due to the high level of quality that customers and companies expect from products and services. For this reason, it is important to not only rely on what is being developed in headquarters but also develop services and products adapted to local needs. We also see companies investing in the Mexican talent pipeline. Companies such as Audi are developing programs with universities to develop local talent and giving young students the opportunity to work and initiate their careers at an academic stage. Audi offers opportunities for Mexican students not only in Mexico but also in its facilities in Germany. To some extent, Evonik is developing a similar program in Mexico. We collaborate with universities in both Mexico and Germany to work in different areas of our organization through internships, and many of these students stay in the company after the program is finished.</p><h4>How will recent mergers and acquisitions impact Evonik's business model?</h4><p>Integrating recent acquisitions into our business model is one of our most important projects at the moment. We completed two important acquisitions in the US; one is the performance materials division of air products, while the other is a producer of precipitated silica for dental care, JM Huber. These acquisitions will increase our product portfolio and customer base in Mexico. JM Huber is a well-known and active American company in precipitated silicas, especially for the production of toothpaste. In this business, we will strengthen our partnership with Mission Hills and Procter &amp; Gamble in Mexico, among others. We have been selected as the main supplier of all its necessary raw materials for the production of toothpaste. Mission Hills Mexico is also the largest toothpaste manufacturing site of Colgate in the world. In addition to dental care, just to give you another example, our products and technologies for the manufacturing of car seats will benefit the most from our other acquisitions, particularly tier-one and tier-two automotive companies. This also benefits our coatings and additives business line from which we serve companies like PPG Comex, one of our largest customers. So far in Mexico, both acquisitions have received positive feedback from our customer base. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did the company become a Tier 2 company within the automotive industry of Mexico? </h4><p>Cuprum has a long history in aluminum extrusions, having started over 72 years ago. Cuprum gained experience extruding components for the construction industry, making profiles for doors and windows and basic standard industrial profiles. We continued to gain experience and started to fabricate ladders that are now in homes all over the world. With these types of products, Cuprum became the leading extruder of aluminum in Latin America, the leader in the ladder market in Canada and Mexico, and second in the US. Over the years, with the cost of gasoline hikes and tighter laws on lowering CO2 emissions, OEMs have focused on lowering the weight of both passenger cars and light trucks in order to improve efficiency by replacing heavy materials such as steel with lighter materials such as aluminum. It started mainly with premium vehicles, but again, as technologies are getting better and lighter vehicles are needed, the use of aluminum is growing in all types of cars and trucks. </p><h4>What is Cuprum's standpoint on Industry 4.0? </h4><p>We have identified projects for our Manufacturing 4.0 strategy and implemented a digital transformation management team. These projects were selected because they provide the most value with the least risk. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[enrique-maldonado-director-northern-region-calidra]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How much of the market does Calidra currently encompass in Mexico?</h4><p>Calidra Group has approximately 60% of the overall lime market in Mexico and 85% of the lime market in the mining sector. The construction market has a huge array of opportunities in infrastructure, especially in soil stabilization; however, it is not so easy as the infrastructure industry is being held back by a lack of investment from the private and public sectors. We are seeing a contraction in this industry not due to the economy, but the lack of political certainty. The mining sector is also being impacted, particularly from the risk of communities blocking the development of new projects. It is a high-risk investment</p><h4>What industries are the most important for you in Mexico?</h4><p>We have five important markets: mining, iron and steel, chemical industry, food, and building mortar. That said, we want to do more to promote the uses of lime for infrastructure such as roads, industrial parks, airports, and parks. We have worked with all the construction chambers and municipalities; however, it is hard to convince governmental entities to invest in lime since it makes projects more expensive, but it is an investment that saves money in the long term, as roads will require less maintenance expenses.</p><h4>How much lime does the company produce in Mexico and Latin America?<br></h4><p>In Mexico, our production capacity is 9,000tpd, and throughout Latin America the group produces approximately 12,000tpd. We do not have plans to expand our lime production in Mexico. We just postponed the construction of a new furnace in the northwest. That kiln capacity is supposed to produce 400 tons per day to supply the mining market. But the mining projects have been paused, and we suspended the kiln construction. The project is ready to get started, but we will continue with the construction of the furnace until we see the first signs of investment from our partners, such as Grupo Peñoles, Grupo Mexico, and Goldcorp. When they are willing to take the risk of their investments, we will take ours.</p><h4>What strategies is the company using to diversify its portfolio?<br></h4><p>The first strategy is exportation. Some part of the investment of the Calidra Group is in South America, namely Argentina, Colombia, Chile, Peru, and Honduras. If we do not do well in Mexico, we still have a balanced portfolio to rely on in the region. That said, we do not expect large growth in 2019.</p><h4>What are your main priorities when it comes to international expansion?<br></h4><p>We recently acquired Sibelco in South America, which mainly serves Chile. It is the main supplier of the largest copper producer in Chile, Codelco. There are also some large distribution centers in Chile that originate from Sibelco Argentina. A large portion of Sibelco's market is mining, particularly in Chile, because there are no deposits to make lime of good quality there. Still, it is a great opportunity for us because the market is in dollars. Chile has a stable economy, and the crisis in Argentina is recovering, so that acquisition gives us the opportunity to strengthen ourselves in South America. Now, our vision in the medium term is to solidify or confirm our presence in Latin America and in the long term diversify throughout America. We plan to eventually enter the US market, especially the food industry, which requires higher quality standards and FDA, GMP, and HACCP certifications. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[jaime-cohen-president-ceo-mercedes-benz-mexico]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does consumer demand for vehicles in Mexico differ from other countries?</h4><p>Mexico has seen a rapid change and development in the segment in the last 20 years. Europe and North America are where the change first happens, but Mexico is leading the LATAM region. Someone coming here will find a developed and sophisticated country and customers. Mercedes-Benz was the first luxury brand in Mexico when it entered in 1993, and we were thrilled because we sold 263 cars that first year. In 2018, Mercedes-Benz Mexico sold roughly 20,000. We have seen significant growth, and the customer profile has also changed. They have become more knowledgeable and demanding, not only of the quality, technology, and servicing of the vehicles, but also in terms of their ecological expectations and the interconnectivity and gadgets they expect in a car.</p><h4>How did sales in Mexico in 2018 compare to previous years?</h4><p>We sold 20,000 cars in 2018, which represents a growing volume. It is also significant for us because for a few years, even with small volumes, Mercedes-Benz was the number-one brand in the luxury car market. We lost this position for a few years but recovered it in 2017. In both 2017 and 2018, we were number one in the luxury segment. Our team and dealer network are proud and pleased with the work we have done.</p><h4>What is the next step in terms of continuing to improve your service and surprising your customers?</h4><p>That is a challenge because everyone knows the car and the name; a brand is not just advertising and marketing, but a promise. One promise we have made for 133 years is innovation. We always say we were born innovating and with the best quality, which is a promise Mercedes-Benz has kept. That is what customers expect and want when they buy our cars. We continuously innovate and evolve. In addition, someone who bought one of our cars in the 1950s or 1960s expects the same level of service, support, and commitment from us. We have both a heritage and innovation that reflects not only in what we do in the future and our forward-looking cars, but also with all the respect and support for our legacy vehicles. Customers always expect more, and new concepts and gadgets are constantly raising the bar. Furthermore, customers have more points of reference and can research different possibilities and options. We have to be ready to over-deliver.</p><h4>What are your operational outcome objectives for 2019? </h4><p>We have two main goals. One is to maintain our number-one position in terms of sales. Second, we have to further strengthen our service support, establish a standard, and surpass it every time. After all, this is Mercedes-Benz. We are in a transitional period where we are bringing in new models to the market, including hybrid and electric cars, among others. We have to ensure our whole global network works with us to support these new products. There is a big expectation of service. Mercedes-Benz is a synonym for service and quality, which is what we will focus on in 2019.</p><h4>What strategies is Mercedes-Benz using to adapt to the needs of younger generations?</h4><p>About 20-30 years ago, there were only four Mercedes-Benz models, and the lifetime of those was seven to 10 years. Everyone was pleased with that. Today, in comparison, we have a huge portfolio of around 30 models, and each has two or three versions. Not only is there a breadth of portfolio, but the younger generation has also grown impatient. They want everything quickly and get bored quickly. Now we have to present new improvements in our models every two or three years. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does CESCA play within Mexico's energy transition?</h4><p>CESCA has been working on projects that focus on sustainable energy for the future. We collaborate on projects scattered throughout the country, several of which are in regions where natural resources such as wind and sunlight are abundant. The energy reform in Mexico is advancing sufficiently, and it's more than a necessary step forward for the country. Our job includes the evaluation of the environmental aspects of projects, such as the migratory routes of birds and bats that can be affected by wind energy projects in a region. It is extremely important that our clients trust us. Our qualified staff is an invaluable asset to achieve our goals, and specialists in a wide array of sciences participate in our studies. We always strive to innovate and treat each evaluation and study as unique.   </p><h4>How will environmental law in Mexico change in the coming years?</h4><p>Mexico has an adequate legal framework; however, there are a few details that the country could focus on to improve the system. The Environment and Natural Resources Ministry (SEMARNAT) requires projects to consider each step it needs as separate mini projects and not as a whole, which can complicate the evaluation. </p><h4>What can operators do to avoid blockades in their projects?</h4><p>All projects have to respect basic human rights, such as the right to information; communities have the right to know how projects will impact their areas. In the past, operators used to have zero communication with communities, as projects were mostly carried out on private properties. With the new energy reform, it is now mandatory to consider the people living in areas near projects, so we help our clients to comply with these new requirements. Another important topic is security. For instance, Coahuila and Tamaulipas are two states with high levels of insecurity, but also a high potential for renewable energy. </p><h4>What are the biggest challenges your clients face when it comes to obtaining environmental permits?</h4><p>It is definitely having enough information. Companies need to have enough and reliable information to obtain project authorization from the authorities. If the latter do not have the necessary technical, legal, and administrative information, it will be hard for companies to obtain a permit. They cannot do anything on the site without the corresponding authorization. Sometimes projects require many permits for matters such as environmental impact, land use changes within forests, state permits, use of water, waste handling, and so on. We do not believe in a middle-point between feasibility and the minimization of environmental impacts within projects. Rather, it is in the best interest of our clients to fully comply and implement all environmental benchmarks, without damaging third parties.  </p><h4>How important is the use of technology in increasing the sustainability of a project?</h4><p>We use technology to improve our ability for data management. CESCA has a highly qualified team that constantly trains people on these topics. Data is another important tool to ensure the sustainability of a project. For example, we can use forest data to inform the authorities on the impact certain project has on biodiversity. Other data we use includes algorithms for soil erosion calculations or to estimate the loss of underground water. We have been using these formulas for the last 10 years, and they are constantly being improved. Besides, it is no longer enough to have preventive and mitigation measures alone, but compensatory ones as well. </p><h4>How do you seek to consolidate your presence in Mexico in the next five years?</h4><p>We are working on strengthening the services we offer by continuing to increase our knowledge on the use of data and taking advantage of the information available for our regional studies. We also aim to work together with universities. We are constantly working on ways to acquire more data in order to offer better and more complete studies for our clients.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[blowing-in-the-wind]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why did you choose Mexico to invest in such large projects?</h4><p>Mexico has many advantages, namely its size and resources. The amount of solar power that can be generated is one of the highest in the world, which makes it possible to develop large projects of over 500MW. In addition, from an economic and social point of view, the new regulations have established a context in which one can invest large sums of money. We firmly believe that each of our projects will generate a positive change for the Mexican society, both with our goal of generating 35% of energy from renewable sources and by helping the communities close to our projects, whether it is through employment, training, or programs designed according to our Creating Shared Value philosophy.</p><h4>How does your subsidiary Enel Energí­a Mexico complement the work of Enel Green Power Mexico?</h4><p>This is part of Enel's new global line of business called Global Trading. We see a great deal of interest in the world and in Mexico among commercial and industrial clients. Mexico is an interesting market for this line of business. Our qualified supplier, Enel Energí­a, is the vehicle through which we will develop this market, and in the coming years it will be another important pillar of our work here. It is part of our two-step strategy to start commercializing energy in Mexico. We want to be as close as possible to our clients while also thinking about future services. This is part of another line of business we have called ENEL-X. Second, the auctions are an interesting opportunity to keep growing, though sometimes we cannot extract the total value of the project as specified. There is even more space to grow if we go directly to clients.</p><h4>What are your plans with Holdco in upcoming projects such as Amistad?</h4><p>Compared to other companies, we have an economic strength and stability that allows us to move quickly during the construction period. We do not have to rely on project financing for the construction, which is a major advantage for rapid development. We also bring different types of investors to our projects, which allows us to focus our resources on expansion. This economic strength is one of the reasons why we can plan, build, and operate great projects, such as Amistad, which will be considered the largest wind park complex in Mexico.</p><h4>How do you plan to participate in upcoming auctions?</h4><p>As much as we like to compete—and competition is an extremely important pillar to succeed in Mexico—we also like to win. We are the only company that has won all the three long-term auctions held in the country, and we plan to retain our leadership in the renewable market and our record of winning all the auctions in Mexico. The rules are slowly changing, but they need to do so even faster, as the reform needs modifications and updates. We would like for this to continue to evolve toward transparency, security, and clear rules.</p><h4>How do you ensure the development of viable projects considering that the average price per project is becoming cheaper?</h4><p>The fall in energy prices is a global phenomenon, mostly because the cost of energy generation is going down as well. Technology is greatly improving, which allows us to extract more energy from a single panel, reducing the costs even further. This is a trend that will continue in the coming months and years, and we can guarantee that energy will stay as cheap as it is right now.</p><h4>What are the next projects in your pipeline?</h4><p>We are working on the construction of first part of the Amistad wind farm complex, which will enter into operation by the end of 2018. We are also working on the construction of Salitrillos, which will enter into action at the beginning of 2019. œ–</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will the new administration impact the Mexican economy and your business?</h4><p>Mexico is facing a new type of leadership and a new mode of doing business, and we remain optimistic about it. The new administration is fulfilling some campaign promises, and the market has reacted negatively, but we still believe the country has strong economic fundamentals. We will continue to invest in Mexico and be on the lookout for opportunities to grow.</p><h4>What are the main areas of opportunity you have identified in Mexico's financial market?</h4><p>The main areas of opportunity in the financial market remain in the underserved SMEs. SMEs in Mexico represent 99.8% of the economic units in the country, generating over 40% of the GDP and employing over 78% of the country. However, there is a lack of institutional sources of capital for them. PlusCorp, through its subsidiaries Sofoplus and Plus Leasing, offers innovative banking solutions to SMEs, ranging from simple and revolving lines of credit to leasing solutions.</p><h4>What differentiates you from other multi-purpose financial companies (SOFOMs) in the market that focus on mid-sized companies?</h4><p>Most SOFOMs in Mexico are focused in micro-credit and financing payrolls; however, we look to target high-growth SMEs that need capital to scale and grow. We can build long-term relationships with cash flow generating SMEs that need access to capital to finance growth. We are nimble and have enough experience to understand our clients' financing need so that we can provide them tailor-made solutions. Also, being a regulated entity has given us access to competitive sources of funding from public markets, including BMV and BIVA, and development and commercial banks, enabling us to have competitive prices.</p><h4>What sectors are you focusing on?</h4><p>We always look to maintain a diversified portfolio. The main sectors we focus on include construction, services, tourism, and manufacturing. We expect significant growth in the tourism and services sectors in the Mexican market in 2019. As noted, we are sector agnostic and have enough experience and expertise to give the best solutions for our clients.</p><h4>What kind of steps do you need to take to launch an IPO in the future?</h4><p>We have been thinking of an IPO since the creation of the company. In 2015, we became a regulated entity and later began the CEBURE program in the BMV and BIVA. We also operate with a high degree of corporate governance, having independent committees and a board of directors. We have always complied with all the National Banking Commission audits. In 2018, we partnered with Creation Investments and are currently working on a business plan that includes aggressive growth in portfolio and improvement in our best practices. In the next few years, we will reach the scale to have a liquidity event through an IPO.</p><h4>How was PlusCorp developed?</h4><p>The founding team of PlusCorp has been heavily involved in the financial sector in Mexico for the last 30 years. Prior to PlusCorp, it developed one of the largest currency exchange companies in the country. While operating the currency exchange, the founding team realized that many of the institutional customers were SMEs who needed networking capital financing. In 2006, Sofoplus was created with the premise of providing tailor-made lending solutions to Mexican SMEs. In 2014, we founded Plus Leasing, focused on leasing solutions for SMEs, and PlusCorp as the holding company. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How many Mexican companies are listed on TSX and TSXV, and how much growth do you foresee in the next year?</h4><p>Mexico is our most robust market in Latin America in terms of equity capital raised and is still our primary focus. Notably, we saw five new mining companies with properties in Mexico list on our exchanges in 2018, like Avino Silver and Orla Mining. These companies had no problem raising funds. That investor support is another reason why Mexican companies continue to look at Canada as a place to raise capital. We have 126 companies with properties in Mexico listed between our two markets and have raised approximately USD410 million in equity capital. In terms of growth, we continue to see Mexico as one of our key markets.</p><h4>What areas of opportunity has TSX identified from the change of administration?</h4><p>We are observing the transition carefully because Mexico is a key jurisdiction. We continue to make investments not just in Mexico, but in the broader Latin American region. We recently hired someone on the ground in Brazil who can also address the broader Latin American market. We have heard different things as everyone in Mexico is still trying to get some clarity on the country's future direction. Mining is something we have been focused on, but we have also been encouraged by developments around energy deregulation over the past few years. We are watching closely to see how those policies will move forward under President Andrés Manuel López Obrador because we see a major opportunity in the energy sector. If that window opens in Mexico, we see a great opportunity for us to bring some companies and opportunities to Canada and have them raise capital and potentially go public as well.</p><h4>What advantages does TSX offer companies with projects in Mexico compared to other exchanges globally?</h4><p>We are known as the world's leading global mining exchange. We list nearly 50% of all the public mining companies in the world. Our 2018 financing statistics show that 49% of all global mining financings were completed on our markets. This has to do with the ecosystem in Canada. We have a vibrant community of lawyers, bankers, and broader stakeholders who understand the resource industry because it has evolved here over 150 years. Equally important is the broad investment ecosystem that knows how to value resource companies and the regulatory framework under National Instrument 43-101 that allows companies to be valued based on their inferred resources. As a result, companies can drive higher valuations and, therefore, raise capital more freely. We also have a large retail investing community that is somewhat unique to Canada. Most average people in Canada have trading accounts and actively participate in these mining and resource companies.</p><h4>What strategies is TSX using to grow its presence in other industries in Mexico?</h4><p>Our focus continues to be primarily mining and energy in Mexico. We also work with the consulate on a number of initiatives. As things evolve, we will look at whether we require further investment in Mexico. We are open to other opportunities, but there is no formal strategy or investment as heavy as in Mexico's mining and energy sectors. Notably, Mexico begins to look interesting when you consider the growth of the cannabis industry. We see a huge opportunity as that industry starts to evolve because we have solidified and positioned ourselves as the global marketplace for cannabis. We have raised nearly USD12 billion in that sector over the last five years with 50 companies listed on our market, and we don't see that slowing down. We have some listed companies on TSX and TSX Venture that are doing business with companies in Mexico relating to cannabis. We have shown that Canada is a great market that is really supportive of financing the cannabis industry. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the vision of the new administration affecting the country and BMV in particular?</h4><p>We have been positively surprised by the new administration, even though it is a significant change from the previous administration. At the beginning of the year, the new administration made an announcement supporting the exchange, with a program to promote the financial system. That program includes helping the banking sector and the local stock exchange market, including a tax reduction for IPOs from 30% to 10% as well as supporting the development of the securities lending market. We thought the new administration would not prioritize the stock exchange, but it was one of the first things it announced. This was a positive message for the markets and investors. The new administration has many infrastructure plans, and it knows many of these projects will need money. And one effective way to raise this money is through the exchange.</p><h4>What strategies do you use to maintain the competitiveness of BMV?</h4><p>We maintain our competitiveness in the global capital market by developing tools that meet consumer and client demands. We have to continue to increase our competitiveness. One of our main competitors is the US market. We have drawn many foreign investors to participate in the exchange. When there is a US holiday, the trading volume of the businesses in Mexico is 10% of a normal day because of that. Commercially, we see a great deal of interaction between Mexico and the US in the exchange. We are competing with these markets, so we have to continue to be competitive. In the local market, we have 150 companies just talking about equities, not including fibras and all the other products. We also created an International Quotation System (SIC), after noting great interest from locals in foreign equities. SIC has added a great deal of activity to our daily traded volume in the stock exchange, mostly for US companies. Mexicans can use it to invest in any company around the world. Today, we have 2,000 listed values in BMV. Of those 2,000, almost half are stocks and half are ETFs. On average, we have MXN15 billion (USD782 million) total daily trade volume. Of that, MXN9 billion (USD469 million) are local stocks and MXN6 billion (USD312 million) are foreign stocks. Of those 2,000 foreign values, about 70% are US companies.</p><h4>What cultural barriers does BMV face when it comes to incentivizing more companies to list?</h4><p>There are many cultural barriers to overcome, because most of the companies in Mexico are family owned. They are reluctant to go public. It also takes a lot of time for companies to list, because there are many things the company needs to work on before going public. These tasks include regulatory compliance in terms of financial information, standardized financial information, and corporate governance. The main challenge in Mexico is the lack of knowledge about the exchange. Both companies and investors underestimate the benefits of being public or investing in the stock exchange and overestimate the costs and requirements for a company being publicly traded or for an investor to participate in the stock exchange. The 150 companies listed in Mexico are highly concentrated in Mexico City, Nuevo León, Jalisco, the state of Mexico, and Chihuahua. There many other states that have companies and industry sectors with the potential to join the BMV, but they may have no idea where to start. People think they need be a huge company or a big investor to join the BMV and become a public company. However, this is not the case. That is why companies are always surprised that the requirements and the limits are much lower than what they had assumed. We should all be changing the financial culture for everyone in Mexico. This is a challenge for everyone, not just BMV. We should all be engaged with finance, investing, and savings. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[luis-arceo-country-manager-izettle-mexico]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why is Mexico's card payment market strategic for iZettle?</h4><p>Mexico is an extremely important country within iZettle's global strategy. iZettle Mexico started operating in 2013, and this was its first country outside of Europe. Today, we have a presence in 12 countries—10 in Europe plus Mexico and Brazil. Mexico is a huge economy, the 14th-largest globally, and there is low card payment penetration. Approximately 85% of consumption is still done through cash here. On the other hand, there are about 180 million debit and credit cards in the market, which means the average person has about three cards. The problem, therefore, is from the other side of the equation. Only six merchants out of every 1,000 inhabitants in Mexico accept card payments, compared to 25 in Brazil, more than 50 in the US, and as much as 70 in Europe.</p><h4>What does Mexico need to become a more cashless society?</h4><p>Mexico needs to fully utilize more fintech companies that provide more financial services in a more accessible way. It is important to show we can serve the unattended segment of merchants with a low-cost solution. While we can offer a safe and accessible solution to accept card payments and manage their business, traditional banking services have many requirements for these small merchants and are more focused on medium and large corporations. We have identified many areas of opportunities to better serve the financial needs of the nano, micro, and small merchant segments, our core segments. Our mission is to help small businesses access tools that were previously only available to their much larger competitors. Currently, 95% of our Mexican merchant base is nano, micro, and small businesses. However, 5% of our merchants are large corporations, like Coca-Cola and luxury boutiques such as Hugo Boss and Swatch. With iZettle, a merchant can accept any card brand with a reader that connects to a smartphone or tablet. Additionally, other hardware can be integrated like a cash drawer to complete the POS solution.</p><h4>What share of the Mexican market does iZettle currently hold?</h4><p>We are in the top three players in Mexico out of about 15. We have hundreds of thousands of merchants around the world, with another thousand new merchants joining us every day. We can accept merchants at any time of the day, and our solution can be utilized directly from the iZettle app. With a card reader, one can start accepting payments within five minutes, which is why so many new merchants join iZettle every day.</p><h4>How will PayPal's acquisition of iZettle impact your business in Mexico?</h4><p>Teaming up with another company is not a small thing; however, when we were discussing this with PayPal's CEO and his team, it became obvious we share the same vision of empowering small businesses. This acquisition truly gives iZettle the resources to fuel its growth. iZettle has a presence in 12 countries, and PayPal is in more than 200 countries. Together, we will offer a one-stop shop for commerce for small businesses around the world.</p><h4>How are fintech companies and card brands collaborating to make countries more cashless?</h4><p>This is an extremely important part of our DNA. Working together with MasterCard and Visa on specific projects has been great since we started. For example, we launched a financial inclusion program with Visa almost two years ago with the sole goal of empowering and including small merchants in the financial ecosystem. We also recently launched a contactless campaign with MasterCard. iZettle is the only card reader solution in Mexico where one can pay with a contactless card or e-wallet. We are promoting new technologies and doing great things with innovative technology. The lack of financial education among small businesses is a key barrier, and having these relationships with relevant brands such as MasterCard and Visa help us show our merchants and potential merchant clients that we are a solution they can trust. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[better-outcomes-for-all]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>KFMC has grown to become one of the leading tertiary care facilities, now within the Riyadh Second Healthcare Cluster. What opportunities are there to increase efficiency and better serve patients in the new structure?<br></strong>The concept of a “cluster" is a population-based entity, serving some 1.5-3 million people, rather than a specific geographical area or location. We are moving from the previous service-centered approach toward implementing a patient-centered approach. Within the clusters, all levels of care are provided: primary, secondary and advanced care. The system is driven by outcomes so patients have easy access to consistent quality and efficient care. We are empowering primary healthcare centers to take the lead in providing all primary and chronic care, which will offload the tertiary care centers. This care will be provided at the new and revamped primary care facilities, allowing them to act as the vendor for triaging and referral to specialist care. Primary healthcare will be the hub for all access to care, which is a major transformation—in fact, it should deliver around 60% of total healthcare provided. The grand vision is to have a healthier population and increase the life expectancy from the current 72 to 80 by 2030. This requires, aside from adequate healthcare, a large number of preventative measures, for which we are launching awareness campaigns, recruiting health coaches, and addressing chronic diseases from their inception rather than dealing with the complications later. This approach enables patients to become more proactive and to take ownership of their personal health rather than react to complications that need to be dealt with at a higher level or crisis managed. There are some gaps in the healthcare system and budget constraints, which allows for more public-private collaboration. For us, it is not for the purpose of generating revenue, but rather to close these gaps. We still need to set our quality measures and KPIs, which all healthcare providers are obliged to follow; good performers will be incentivized, outstanding performers will be rewarded, and underperformers will be guided.</p><p><strong>How do you envision enhancing the provision of how trauma care?</strong><br>Trauma is fragmented today, which is why it is not yet on par globally. In fact, trauma is the leading cause of death in Saudi Arabia for the younger population. In other countries, the leading cause of death is cancer, chronic diseases, with trauma holding between fifth and 10th place. Therefore, it is one of our three primary focuses on the level of our national programs along with stroke and coronary disease. We require an integrated efficient system that will provide a high level of trauma service—high alert, quick access, and adequate post trauma care. Today, we do not have long-term care facilities, and there is a shortage of rehabilitation hospitals. One can provide acute care for trauma cases, though unfortunately some require long-term care including rehab services. It has to be a comprehensive care from start to finish with the concept of integrated practice units (IPUs)— from the moment a patient is placed in the ambulance all the way through the necessary levels of care, inclusive of rehabilitation services such as physiotherapy. Currently, the waiting list is six months long for a rehabilitation hospital and two years for a long-term care facility. We are currently working on an initiative to build a rehabilitation hospital with 400 beds, involving a private investor, with which we recently signed a contract. This model is an excellent alternative, as undertaking a venture of this magnitude without an investor would not be possible. It would drain the resources needed for acute care.</p><p><strong>What is your vision on the application of telemedicine, both for consultations and long-distance treatment, and on using technology for advanced medical care in general?<br></strong>The country's healthcare administration has realized that without investing in e-health, we will have redundancy in the system, so it is certainly a priority for all stakeholders involved. Today, we are understaffed in terms of ICU and oncology physicians for which there is big demand. Therefore, it would be impossible to establish such a tertiary care center somewhere in the north of the Kingdom, though we can strive to provide a similar service utilizing technology: telemedicine, tele-ICU, tele-emergency, and tele-oncology. KFMC has initiated a teleclinic with a partner in the north, currently covering four services on a weekly basis: cardiology, oncology, ICU, and pediatrics. Patients can communicate with a physician, while there is a robot programmed for that as well. Telemedicine has been tested globally in the past 10 years and has proven its value aimed at patient care, cost accounting, and high quality. We are ready to go beyond the pilot stage, and our next step is the rollout of all-encompassing telehealth.</p><p><strong>What are the primary ambitions for the coming years?</strong><br>When we shared our experience with the other clusters, we realized we had many of the same issues in common. There is a robust infrastructure in place, but a large gap between the primary care system level of care provided and the services delivered at the tertiary level, which are in great demand. The coming three years are therefore dedicated to building a robust primary healthcare system. This will offload our outpatient departments by 20%, and we should be able to cut our waiting lists by 25%. At the same time, we can provide specialized chronic care in the primary healthcare setting. In terms of financial management, we strive to develop a better data collection and data banking system to enable us to utilize a more transparent method of calculating costs. Over the last 10 years, we have invested heavily in certain disease groups, and we have become proficient in neuroscience, cardiac care, and oncology. Before committing and making new investments in specific areas, we need to have our value-based healthcare system and integrated practice units in place. A patient should be comfortable knowing that when he comes for heart surgery, he will be taken care of from the moment he is admitted to the hospital until he is discharged with the desired outcome.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[banking-on-success]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As BanBají­o starts its 25th year of operations, what milestones have marked this period for the bank?</h4><p>The bank was founded in 1994 with a capital of MXN120 million (USD6.29 million) in the context of the tequila crisis. The vision then was to create a regional bank focused on the export sector. In 1998, we put in place a strategy to become the financial partner of choice for medium enterprises. At the time, we signed a partnership with Spain's Banco Sabadell that allowed us to grow in international business and offer import-export-related financial services. The main focus of the bank has been to have excellent relation with clients. Traditionally, banks in Mexico have committees to approve credit, but we instead replicated the system that Banco Sabadell had thereby resulting in an agile credit process. This allowed us to penetrate some industries. For example, we have been the leader in the agribusiness sector for 13 years in a row. To date, 10% of our commercial portfolio is in agriculture. Before, it was nearly 20% of all of our loans and represented 30% of our revenues. So we had decided to diversify in other areas. For instance, we have tremendously grown in services for SMEs. We enjoy serving these companies that have steadily gotten into the 'formal' sector through our services.</p><h4>What has been the performance of the bank after its IPO in 2017?</h4><p>The IPO was an excellent decision. Interest rates have been low in Mexico, at 3.3% even, so that was a challenging environment for the sector. In a short time period, we experienced high profitability levels of up to 16% annually, so the goal was to tell a story to make investors understand that this was a sustainable company. We put in place a plan to make investors aware of our strengths as a financial institution. The performance of the bank, compared to others, has been excellent. Now, we are the 26th firm with a higher trading level, and that is only after a couple of years of being publicly traded.</p><h4>Which segments drive the profitability of the bank at the moment?</h4><p>Approximately 80% of the bank's business comprise corporates and SMEs, which together, represent what we call company loans. Our policy has always been to compete in service, so we are in a segment of companies that do not move much from bank to bank. Moving forward, we have to develop digital and consumer banking. Many years ago, going to a financial institution was an important event for a businessman. Since 2018, we have been implementing a system to improve our technology platforms. These platforms allow us to reach an enormous market of individuals. Today, we have systems that work well in the business area, and we can expand our business through online platforms and mobile applications. While we will focus as usual on our traditional business segments, moving forward we see great potential to use our existing capacity to penetrate more in retail banking. This will allow us to sustain our growth rate in the coming years.</p><h4>As a local bank, which opportunities do you see in the insurance sector that could complement existing services?</h4><p>We are complementary to the insurance sector; therefore, we have several partnerships to underwrite automotive, life or house policies. We are working with eight insurance companies through this partnership, and what we have learned is that it does not matter the company we partner with, but we are the representative for the client. This means that if the client has any trouble, they might come to us. We are well positioned to offer our services, and, on top of that, guide our clients on what insurance solutions best fit their requirements. Additionally, as an insider, we are knowledgeable about the insurance business and are able to represent our clients in the event of a claim.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the new administration impacting your business?</h4><p>We have received encouraging signs from the government, such as its firm commitment to maintain the three pillars of macroeconomic stability: monetary, fiscal, and trade policy. Against this backdrop, Citibanamex continues with its investment plans and strategy to build the bank of the future. We remain optimistic about Mexico's growth and development potential. In the financial sector in particular, the young demographic profile of the country, the low levels of banking, and growing digitization, especially the wide and growing use of smartphones, offer a huge opportunity to grant millions of Mexicans and small businesses access to formal financial services. This will have a positive impact on the welfare of the people, generate greater productivity, and contribute to more dynamic growth. In addition, for banks, it will represent a huge business potential in the medium and long term. That is why we have been active in promoting and implementing the new Cobro Digital (CoDi) platform, which will allow people to easily open bank accounts linked to a smartphone and make free payments and transfers, opening the door for millions of Mexicans to access the formal financial system.</p><h4>What factors drove the bank to establish a growth forecast of 1.2% for 2019?</h4><p>Our growth forecast for the economy is 1.2% for 2019 and 1.7% for 2020. The main reasons for this adjustment were a significant deceleration in 1Q2019, associated in part to the start of a new government and other extraordinary factors that will not be repeated in the following quarters and will allow for a better growth rate the rest of the year. There is also the continuing stagnation in investment related to uncertainty and the drop in public investment, not to mention concerns about fiscal discipline. The great challenge is to ignite growth. A significant increase in public and private investment is required, and to achieve this it will be important for the government to implement market-friendly policies that generate certainty and confidence and improve the business environment. The approval of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) would be a positive signal for the investment and growth of the country. However, President's Trumps proposal to impose 5% tariffs on all goods imported from Mexico can complicate or at least delay the approval of the trade agreement.</p><h4>What new services or products does the company plan to release in the next three years to better meet the needs of its clients?</h4><p>New technologies and social media are changing the habits, needs, and preferences of our society. In Mexico, for example, around 75% of Mexicans have a smartphone, and on average, Mexicans spend around six hours a day in their mobile phones. Thus, we have been advancing to consolidate an omnichannel network, namely aligning our different points of contact with clients at branches, ATMs, telephone banking, call centers, internet banking via website or mobile applications, point of sale terminals, for example, to offer the best products and services when and wherever the client needs them. Though the use of new digital channels is growing quickly, branches will not disappear. They will be used less to process traditional transactions—deposits, payment of services, cash checks, transfers, and so on—and will increasingly become centers where clients go to obtain financial advice. We have also promoted the use of digital channels, both our website and applications available on the cell phone. As a result, today we have more than 3.5 million digital users. Citibanamex represents 92% of the growth of mobile banking users. We are also betting strongly on our digital channels led by strong investment in our mobile and online teams. Last, but not least, we are betting heavily on the new CoDi platform. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main factors impacting GDP growth in the country?</h4><p>We lowered 2019's growth forecast, but kept the same range for 2020's. In 2019, the deceleration of growth was a little more than anticipated. There have been logistical issues regarding gasoline distribution, certain railways not operating as they usually do, strikes in the northeast, some elements that made it a little harder to move items across the border, and transitory effects related to changes in public spending with a new administration. These appear to be of a transitory nature, however, and we expect GDP to recover in the second quarter and beyond. That said, there is also a balance of risk skewed on the down side, so we do see more risks associated going down, which is why we amended our growth forecast for this year.</p><h4>What explains the peso's recent performance?</h4><p>In the last few years, the external accounts have faced a significant transformation, and Mexico has gone from being an oil-exporting economy to an oil-importing one, which entailed challenges regarding the external accounts that required a significant real exchange rate depreciation of the peso. We need to have a strong macro mix in order to cope with these challenges and have an orderly adjustment in the economy. This includes a tighter fiscal and monetary financial system and using the FX as a shock absorber. That has been the item of the macro policy mix for the last few years. In 2019, we have seen both internal and external uncertainty, while trade tensions have also heightened FX volatility. Emerging market currencies have been more volatile due to trade tensions; considering Mexico's openness and the relevance of exports to the US, bilateral issues are important for FX.</p><h4>What challenges has the Mexican economy faced in the last few years?</h4><p>There was a change in the oil trade balance from a surplus to a deficit in the last four years, which required a major adjustment in the economy. It is always hard to gauge the position of the economy in the business cycle, especially in emerging markets, because we are subject to other types of shocks both external and internal. In our most recent monetary policy communiqués, we have highlighted that economic activity has declined more than anticipated, and inflation has not fallen as quickly as expected. There are several elements pressuring inflation related to increasing energy prices and some services' inflation related to recent increases in wages. As we go forward, we will have to gauge GDP dynamics and the cyclical position of the economy, as well as potential supply shocks that have affected inflation and see what they entail for our inflation forecast.</p><h4>What have been the main advancements of your digital payments platform CoDi?</h4><p>The payments system is one of the areas of responsibility of the Central Bank. We not only seek low and stable inflation but also a sound financial and payments system. We are a different central bank in that we provide both the large value and a retail payment system. As providers of the latter, a mobile-to-mobile payment system is feasible and the logical next step for our network. We have an RTGS payment system; it works 24/7 every day of the year, which is a significant step to allow for these mobile-to-mobile networks. These are based on QR and NFC technologies, so any Mexican with a smartphone and a bank account or a financial institution account can pay or receive payments at any time using either QR or NFC technology. We have more than 30 million Mexicans with smartphones but without a checking account or other financial services. In order to use this new payment technology, they will have a strong incentive to open an account with a financial institution, which will not only allow them to use CoDi as an agile payments system, but also give them access to higher value-added financial services.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What information does INEGI provide Mexico?</h4><p>INEGI is Mexico's statistical and geographical authority and coordinates the Mexican National Statistical and Geographical Information System (SNIEG), in which government departments are involved. One of the main sources of information we provide is economic statistics, but we also generate demographic, social, governance, crime, geospatial, and environmental data. Furthermore, we are one of the few institutions in the world that combines both geographical and statistical mandates. This provides us with a strong basis to develop our organization. As part of this, we follow up quick events on a short-term basis to understand what is happening to the economy. Our set of surveys allows us to understand what is going on in both the short and long term. One of our most well-known information programs is the System of National Accounts, a complex set of different types of data, the most famous being GDP. We also create price indices by collecting the producer price index and the consumer price index, which are the bases for the measurement of inflation.</p><h4>In what ways do you collaborate with the private sector to promote investment in Mexico?</h4><p>We collaborate in two ways. We depend crucially on the private sector to compile our statistics. In terms of economic statistics, the most important pieces of information come from them. We have monthly and other annual surveys for which we depend on the continued collaboration of the private sector. The second dimension is on the user side. We have a program to stimulate the use of information by the private sector. We launched our website to make it more user friendly for different types of users. We have basic, specialized, and expert users. Most users from the private sector want to have the time series and economic analysis right in their hands, so we have improved this part of the website. We want to collaborate with the private sector on different types of projects. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In what ways is regulation making the digital transformation of the financial industry more difficult?</h4><p>Mexico's regulatory framework for the finance industry is likely one of the most regulated in the world. For example, consumers are required to go through authorization for every inquiry. In order to comply with the legal framework, credit bureaus have to make users go through an authorization process featuring several questions that makes the user experience terrible. We need to update the law to take full advantage of new digital tools. There is also the issue of consumer data privacy. Most of the data is collected directly from consumers by the grantors, who share this information with the bureau. Users need to make sure their information will be safe throughout this process. The challenge is gaining the trust of consumers, which is why we invest millions of dollars in information security. It is easy for a company to gain the trust of consumers, but it is just as easy to lose it. There is an ongoing evaluation of the balance between risk and value in the minds of consumers, and now they are more empowered to control the use of their data. Giving consumers greater authority over their data can equally help them get more access to credit services, specifically those without credit histories. Financial inclusion is not only about the unbanked, but also people with bad credit histories. There are almost 10 million people in Mexico in this scenario. We are continuously working on developing algorithms that include more information about consumers than before so fewer people are excluded from financial services.</p><h4>Where do credit bureaus fit into the digital transformation of the banking sector?<br></h4><p>Most pieces of a credit report are static, and we use data algorithms to give our clients a more complete image of a person's credit history. Most credit bureaus work with a specific set of data that has not changed in the last 50 years. We are now adding new sets of data with the collaboration of fintech companies to offer more comprehensive credit scores. We do this so users do not just receive a bunch of numbers but a clear report on their credit history patterns via microservices in our API platform. This approach is extremely different from what was available 10 years ago because it allows any grantor to use our services without having to invest a lot of money. We are doing our part by adding more data to the equation and building better algorithms. It is also about finding better ways to connect APIs. Throughout our 14-year history, we have developed different ways of connecting data to our platforms, some are extremely specific and complex.</p><h4>Why is the business designed as a franchise?</h4><p>Our expansion plans are based on franchises, as we want investors in different countries to use our model to open a credit bureau. They could be small credit bureaus seeking to upgrade with access to better technology and products. From our side, we can offer to change their fixed-cost variables, so they pay per transaction. This makes it easier for the investor to maintain their business, as credit bureaus face their biggest costs at the beginning, when growth levels are low and expenses are high. When we started in Mexico, our focus was on targeting segments that were unattended by our competitor, particularly in microfinance and the commercial areas granting credit services, mobile phone companies, and pay TV. Then, we partnered with FICO, a data analytics company that creates a variety of credit scores, to adapt its model to the Mexican market. In 2018, FICO announced its new score in the US that includes utilities to predict default; we have been using this score already for 10 years now. We have prioritized inclusion since the beginning. This has been a great success for us, as it is likely one of the best scores in the country. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the company managed to expand its network throughout the LATAM region using Mexico as a base?</h4><p>London Consulting Group was founded in Monterrey in 1991, a few years before the Tequilazo, which was one of the main economic recessions in Mexico. However, at that time we managed to take advantage of the excellent reputation we had with several multinationals and leveraged this to open projects with them in Colombia, Chile, Argentina, and Brazil. We quickly learned how to open new markets and continued to open operations throughout the rest of Latin America. Today, we are in 25 countries, with a presence in most Latin American countries, the US, Canada, the Caribbean, and recently, we started operations in Spain. Mexico was the first country in which we started to operate and remains one of the most important regions in terms of its number of clients and revenue. Our corporate office continues to be in Monterrey.</p><h4>What sectors are more flexible to changes, and what would be some examples of success?</h4><p>We have clients in every sector, including energy and mining. We did a project with Banregio in which we helped to reduce the time it takes to authorize credit to a client. There are many areas that intervene to grant a loan to a customer; therefore, it is important to integrate them to provide the best service possible for a client. We consolidated in a layout several processes that were required to reduce the approval time of the credit to boost customer satisfaction. Notably, through our services, Banregio reduced the time it takes to approve credits to SMEs by 62% and for the loans for credit card holders by 83%, which led to a 30% increase in the number of credit cards awarded by the bank. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How does Lucky Minerals' operation in the Fortuna Project fit into Ecuador's mining awakening?</strong><br>Lucky Minerals has a 550-sqkm project called Fortuna in Ecuador located in the south of Azuay, Morona Santiago and Zamora Chinchipe provinces. It is a project of 12 contiguous mining concessions awarded at the end of 2016. Lucky Minerals has a great track record in the mining sector and is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. We see huge potential in Ecuador to develop its mining industry. The geology of the country is attractive, and most of it has yet to be explored. Our Fortuna project was born out of historic information that is being reinterpreted. It is still at an early stage, though we have found areas with certain geological anomalies that indicate it is likely to find copper.</p><p><strong>What are your thoughts on the government's efforts to attract foreign investment into the mining sector?</strong><br>The biggest attractiveness of the country is its geological potential; only 7.5% of it has been explored for mining purposes. However, this has to be coupled with a favorable administrative and legal environment. The steps the government has taken to attract FDI have been extremely important for the mining industry. However, there is still a great deal to do to turn Ecuador into a dynamic mining market at the level of neighboring countries such as Colombia, Peru, or Chile. A fundamental step was the concession of 275 areas between 2016 and 2017 for new companies to enter the market. This led international players in the industry to come to Ecuador to bet on a promising business hand-in-hand with the government. The “Mandato Minero" was a moratorium on mining projects in 2008 and was waived in 2016. Since then, mining has been one of the leading contributors to FDI in Ecuador.</p><p><strong>What impact does the mining sector have on the country's economy and its society?</strong><br>Thus far, large-scale mining has not truly kicked off in Ecuador, while the small-scale mining sector already accounts for 1.6% of the country's GDP. With two major projects underway, Fruta del Norte and Mirador, this percentage is expected to increase to 4%. Both started in 2019, so we have yet to see the impact on the macroeconomic level. President Lení­n Moreno recently stated the country received its largest FDI inflow in 2018 since the dollarization of the economy in 1999, and the mining sector represented 53% of all the FDI that the country received over that year, surpassing the oil sector, which has traditionally been key to Ecuador's growth.</p><p><strong>As the sector becomes more prominent, what steps are being taken to guarantee responsible practices?</strong><br>The sector has recently started Alliance for Responsible Mining (AMRE), which some big companies participates in, and that also includes the most important mining association that is the Chamber of Mining. The purpose of this entity is to promote responsibility in areas like rule of law, respect for the environment and communities, safety for employees, and the overall contribution that the mining sector has on the growth of Ecuador as a country. It is in the benefit of all to have a business as socially and environmentally minded as possible. However, the lack of knowledge that Ecuadorians have in the mining sector is a challenge that has to be addressed. The country has traditionally had a small mining sector that did not follow international standards, including a certain degree of illegal mining. These factors have resulted in people thinking the mining sector is harmful to the environment. We want to show that it is possible to do mining while being responsible with the environment and responding quickly if there are any issues that need to be addressed.</p><p><strong>How is the sector addressing the potential cancellation of projects following communities' votes in local referendums?</strong>Foreign companies are in Ecuador to conduct commercial activity to generate jobs and development. In doing so, we fulfill the regulatory framework that the country has established for mining activity, and we need all the parties involved to also respect it in order to have fair rules. Mining operators in Ecuador believe these local referendums are against the constitution and that the process that took place in Girón was flawed. As much as we want communities to be involved in projects, as per the constitution, they cannot made decisions through local referendums in matters that are considered projects of national interest for Ecuador. This would also be the case for large projects in the oil sector or energy generation through hydroelectric plants. Organizing such referendums is a wrong interpretation of the law in the eyes of the mining sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[15% YoY Growth in 2018]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[cesar-octavio-loera-general-manager-national-car-rental-enterprise]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the company's most important achievement in 2018?</h4><p>Our most important achievement was to consolidate our growth by completing the first integration cycle of the two brands we represent in the south and southeast of the country (National Car Rental and Enterprise Rent a Car). We grew by 15% compared to the previous year. Another important achievement was to substantially improve internal processes and our quality of service, which resulted in a very significant increase in the satisfaction rating of our clients. After a continuous improvement program that started two years ago, we saw the results of consistency in our processes and behaviors of our staff focused on service culture. We have had sustainable growth in recent years that have allowed us to invest in continuous training of our staff and improve the internal work environment. We are focused on meeting the needs of our employees and our customers.</p><h4>What factors influenced the results you obtained in 2018?</h4><p>The commitment of our staff has contributed to increasing our portfolio of repeat customers, as well as obtain new sales channels supported by an excellent level of attention. The flow of international reservations increased in 2017 thanks to joint efforts between our corporate entity in the US, the economic conditions of the region, and the interesting and competitive proposals we offer our clients.</p><h4>What type of expansion plans do you have to consolidate your presence in the region?</h4><p>We plan to continue to cover the cities in the country where we are not present. We are maintaining our expansion plans even amid economic uncertainty and insecurity issues. This demand for us has greater planning and analysis.</p><h4>How is growth of the sharing economy impacting your business?</h4><p>These digital platforms are not yet significantly affecting the industry. Applications based on the sharing economy offer similar services, but are not substitutes—there is a defined niche market for us and these applications. Though limited markets could be affected, such as areas with high traffic or parking shortages, these are still cities where car rentals offer competitive advantages that these platforms cannot deliver.</p><h4>What are the main trends impacting the car rental market in Mexico?</h4><p>The large online tourism marketing agencies (OTAs) have influenced much in the way of booking tourist services, including car rental. We are in permanent collaboration with them to make sure we can offer the public the best offers. Service quality is also a relevant issue among service providers and has a critical impact on customer preferences. A few years ago, we started a program of continuous improvement in service with the help of the corporate Enterprise Holding (EHI). We are 100% focused on customer satisfaction through the modification of processes in the "back office" and the constant contact with the customer in the front desk. We receive continuous feedback from our clients through e-mail, calls, or surveys that we conduct every day. Technology impacts every industry, and car rentals are no exception. We invest continuously in information technology in all areas of the company but with a strong focus on improving customer service. Speed and reliability are key to everything.</p><h4>What opportunities does the southeast offer you in the car rental market?</h4><p>Economic growth is not manifesting as expected, and greater support is needed from the federal and state governments to leverage the economy of the southeast. Indeed, the region requires oil, growth projects in maritime docks, and support for tourism promotion. In addition to these, safety and reliability will remain critical for travelers wanting to continue renting cars.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[11 Companies Merged in Past Year]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[enrique-martinez-y-morales-director-general-unities-alliance-group]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does Unities Alliance Group bring to traditional Mexican family business?</h4><p>Unities Alliance Group is a subsidiary of EFM Capital, which was funded approximately six years ago after the sale of a family business to a transnational company. EFM Capital is a solution that family businesses have when owners want to sell or divest, whatever the reason is. It is a humane and experienced team in structuring and perfecting this business model. EFM Capital comes in what we call the “Unities" model, which allows owners to sell their company to an existing company with a corporate structure. This company is Unities Alliance Group. We target medium-sized family businesses with an approximate billing of USD10-20 million per year, and we consolidate them into Unities Alliance Group, which has a larger billing and size, bigger leverage possibilities, higher possibilities of penetration in other markets, and the ability to create economies of scale within the group.</p><h4>How has the market responded to this new business model, and what are the advantages of such a model?</h4><p>So far, it has been extraordinary. Between mid-2018 and the start of 2019, we have merged 11 companies. All are now a part of Unities Alliance Group, and we divided them in three strategic business units. The first is IT, where we are Microsoft's main partner in Mexico, as we offer IT project development, integrated solutions and robotic automation. The second is industry, where we are focused on construction with steel structures, glass and crystal specialized and fire control systems. We are one of the few Mexican companies that have international certifications to construct specialized high-quality structures like the BBVA Bancomer stadium and other symbolic works. The last business unit is retail, with businesses focused on consumption and commerce. One of the advantages of our structure is how different businesses complement each other. We have many crossover sales. We sell licenses, steel, fire systems, and facades to the same customer, for example. This group of companies were chosen strategically complement each other. </p><h4>What is expected from the company's listing on the public stock exchange?</h4><p>The one that would go on sale in public markets is EFM Capital, so that Unities Alliance Group gains flexibility for the rest of the year to continue acquiring companies. EFM is a company specialized in acquiring and selling family companies in an average time of 24 months. In the event case we have full-grown strategic business unities, we are able to put them for sale. Unities is the vehicle that acquires, makes companies grow, turns them professional, makes them more efficient, normalizes them, and structures them in a business group that creates value that can be attractive to an investor. During the first six months, we try to get operational standardization, so that the second half of the year we can focus on new business integrations that can help increase revenue. Our turnover for 2019 is currently projected at around MXN2 billion (over USD100 million), and we have 1,500 employees. We are having conversations with companies that want to be part of our disruptive model.</p><h4>What factors are shaping the business environment in Mexico at the moment?</h4><p>Businesses in Mexico are going through a phase of digitalization. We have some top clients in this business line; some of them are listed on the stock exchange and work in the manufacturing industry. We provide them with robotic and automation equipment, leading them toward AI. The business atmosphere in Mexico is also marked by globalization and internationally by commercial tensions and the new NAFTA treaty. Product tariffs on some products, as well as technology products associated with productivity and automation has increased Asian interest in investing in Mexico. As for the business climate, in our sector, which is the one of family companies, we have not seen a fall in demand. On the contrary, we have seen more companies approaching us to participate in Unities Alliance Group's scheme. There is real opportunity in where three or more family companies merge to form a strategic business unit. Synergies and a bigger organization encourage growth. </p><h4>Which sectors is the company considering for diversification in the future?</h4><p>Our priority is acquiring new companies form the sectors in which we already are investing, to get a larger market share. We receive proposals from companies, and some have a natural synergy with our divisions. Others are in lines that we will explore, like educational services or pharmaceutics. If added, they would be a new division, which would imply a bigger level of diversification. We provide attention to the companies that approach us; we evaluate them in an efficient way, as we can close the deal with companies in a few months thanks to the Unities scheme. Whatever the sector, we look for companies where we can provide an additional value, though. If the company is already mature or has reached its growth limit, it will not be of interest unless it can add value to the companies we have already acquired. Also, our focus is to invest in companies that have a positive impact on people and communities. We are open to exploring new industries, with the exception of alcohol, tobacco and gambling.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the Quito Chamber Commerce positioned itself as a promoter of a market-friendly economy in Ecuador?</h4><p>The Quito Chamber of Commerce is more than 100 years old, and was the first business organization founded in the city, initially representing all sectors of the Ecuadorian economy. Our members represent around 30% of Ecuador's GDP. Chambers of commerce in the country went through changes when the mandatory affiliation was waived, and we then focused on bringing added value to our members through our services and projects. Currently, one of our projects is the centre for commercial studies, that trains students in different areas every year. There is also a research area, that is in charge of analysing macroeconomic data and carrying out research on specific topics or sectors. The Chamber also provides legal consulting to our affiliates. We lead the National Ecuadorian Committee, a large organization that has 97 business organizations as affiliates. The Quito Chamber is also the only Ecuadorian representative of the International Chamber of Commerce, which is the largest business organization in the world. We have some commissions within the ICC programme, including an integrity and transparency commission, the first in the private sector. Our team works on analysing the legislative framework affecting business in Ecuador, lobbying to propose changes that best match the needs of the business community. At the moment, we are working closely with the government on the plans for Ecuador to join the Pacific Alliance. We are also conducting negotiations for a free trade agreement with the US. We are happy to say that we are not only a valuable organization for our represented stakeholders, but also for the country a whole.</p><h4>Which services are tailored by the Chamber to guarantee a soft-landing of international companies coming into the country?</h4><p>Our chamber has collaborated with the Municipality of Quito and business organizations to create Quito Invest, which is an agency dedicated to ease the process for any investor coming to Ecuador and choosing Quito as base for their operations. At the same time, we liaise regularly with the Secretary of Productive Development and Competitiveness of Quito to analyse the city's regulations with regard to FDI, and how it can be improved to raise the profile of Quito as a business hub within the Andean region.</p><h4>What are the challenges for Ecuador to consolidate a positive image outside of the country?</h4><p>The current government has done a great job, and many institutions are independent again after 10 years . The country is back on track, on a democratic path where we can finally breathe the air of freedom and rule of law; however, the economy needs further liberalization. Ecuador is inheriting an oversized administration, which is slowly adjusting, and reducing expenditure. The great challenge to the private sector is support  the economic growth of the country, in order to become that, regulatory changes are still due, as for example, according to our constitution, the private sector should operate in strategic sectors  only if the state requires it specifically. We need faster and more efficient  legal mechanisms for building new hydroelectric plants for example. We need to speed up environmental permits to promote responsible mining. Bilateral investment treaties need to resume in order to create certainty for investors, the pension fund in Ecuador needs management that that better serves workers. These are changes that the country needs to make internally, and that this Chamber firmly advocates for. If we consolidate our internal market and we make it efficient and dynamic, that will be our best presentation toward the world.</p><h4>What is your evaluation of the new commercial policy of the country, and what are the priorities for new trade agreements?</h4><p>The commercial policy of the country is very well managed, and the current administration has a clear roadmap. Ecuador decided to open to international trade. The country is going from isolation and protectionism to promoting open trade. In 2017, a treaty with the European Union came into effect, which yielded positive results and provided space for a more ambitious commercial policy. Now, Ecuador is in the process of joining the Pacific Alliance, which offers an entrance to Asia. It will allow us to negotiate better with the US. In order to enter as an associate member of the Pacific Alliance, an agreement will be required with Mexico, boosting bilateral trade between the two countries. Ecuador also signed an agreement with the European Free Trade Association. New regions for trade are under consideration. Ecuador is now more aware of the need to reach further and promote our exports. Trade can help relieve poverty in the country, while also raising living standards.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How has the company evolved since its establishment, and what are your current projects?<br></strong>The company started in 2005, but kicked off in 2007. It started with limited capital and a small loan and evolved with hard work from a trading to a manufacturing company in 2011. Today, we produce flat products, pipes, doors, angles, and channels. We are currently constructing another factory, the pre-engineering building (PEB). We have factories in South Africa, Egypt, and Ghana involved in the pre-fabrication of warehouses. PEB is completely different from normal warehouses, as it reduces costs by up to 30%. It is modular, and because of the design of the warehouse, it costs less and is more efficient. Nigeria still uses the old traditional system, and PEB can build buildings up to nine or ten stories, all modular, and they can be offices all in steel or designer containers for coffee shops.</p><p><strong>Who are your main clients currently from the first factory?<br></strong>Our clients include construction companies, medium steel fabricators, traders, builders, refineries, and sugar refineries; everything made from steel is produced in the first factory. With the second factory, the new engineering that we are putting in place will reduce costs by 30%. This technology exists in Europe and the US, and Eastern Europe, and proudly we can say we are the only one in Nigeria. We seek to stop the imports of these finished, modular PEBs. We are doing it from scratch and directly with clients, and it is certainly faster. For example, constructing a building with concrete will take two years, while with steel it can take six to eight months. Our market share varies between 35-43% depending on the item. There are some items that we are strong in that we are fully focusing on.</p><p><strong>Was your expansion in the second factory all funded by internal equity</strong><strong>?<br></strong>Everything was funded internally. We believe in Nigeria and see great opportunities here; however, one has to invest in Nigeria to earn market share. We are borrowing locally. At times during the crisis, we faced problems in terms of interest rates that reached 25%; however, we were able to overcome that even though we suffered losses. We reinvested because we believe in Nigeria's future and made sure we raised capital again.</p><p><strong>What other challenges are you facing?<br></strong>Electricity and infrastructure represent 15% of any initial capital. For example, for a project for NGN20 million, one has to invest at least NGN4 million in power, which is not the case in other countries. We are also affected by delays on the road when importing raw materials; it typically takes three to four days to clear your goods, but it can take up to three to four weeks; hence, there are high costs and extremely low margins at these times. Because purchasing power is low, one cannot transfer the high costs on to the consumer, which effects to extremely low margins. The last two to three years have been difficult, though we are sustaining and trying to grow with more investment.</p><p><strong>What can be done to improve this situation?<br></strong>The government has to work on the challenges; the solution is to implement PPP for electricity and roads. This is being implemented to some extent, though it must be done on a bigger scale and laws must be put in place for investors to come. By 2035, Nigeria's population will be 350 million. Where else in the world can one find such an emerging market? Now is the right time for people to invest in Nigeria. We need the right policies so that people will come.</p><p><strong>How do you see things changing with your import substitution?<br></strong>For things to improve, we need to invest more. During this tough time, we are persevering and still investing. We are willing to invest even more because there is potential. We are now focusing on neighboring countries for export. If the roads are improved, they will all come here to Nigeria to buy.</p><p><strong>What message would you send to the international community about doing business in Nigeria today</strong><strong>?<br></strong>With the media abroad, the news on Nigeria is negative, and this has to change. In the industrial areas in Nigeria, such as Lagos, Port Harcourt, Warri, and Abuja, we do not feel these things. The problems are in remote areas. Now is the right time for investors to come. We have reached the bottom and will only be going up now. There are opportunities here for all sectors of business.</p><p><strong>What is your outlook for SABA Steel Industrial Nigeria in 2020?<br></strong>With the start of our new project, Metal Berg Manufacturing, and the expansion of SABA Steel Industrial Nigeria, 2020 will be a better year for all businesses. The policies that the government has implemented in the last five years will make 2020 better than 2018 and 2019. The golden years of USD100-110 per barrel are gone; we should target USD40 per barrel and focus on surviving, improving, and exports. In 2020, we will look more at exports. However, we are in no rush. Once a company starts thinking of moving money out of Nigeria, this is when they start rushing. If we view Nigeria as home, we will start looking at Nigeria differently and see opportunities Nigeria must be home no rush with long view, this is a message to Investors.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why have you focused on economic development in the southeast?</h4><p>We are convinced that now is the moment for the southeast peninsula, not only because the new federal administration is directing substantial resources to that region, but also because Quintana Roo, in particular, has been the tourism engine of the country for many years, and is a beacon for all businessmen and investors in the Peninsula of Yucatán. There are extraordinary spaces ready for development because there is a great deal of talented, well-prepared, and capable people available. We have also had an excellent regional government. Security is also a strong added value as it provides extraordinary conditions for continued development, investment, and trust in what we do.</p><h4>In which key sectors are you investing?</h4><p>We have made a serious commitment in the energy industry by investing in the development of talent in the sector through our university, ITPE. We also invested in a small oil services company that has become a vital technological component and bet heavily on the real estate sector, which has performed solidly in the region, particularly in Cancún and Mérida.</p><h4>Why is it a great moment to invest in the energy sector?</h4><p>The private sector had the possibility of investing in energy for the first time, and we decided to enter the sector with great confidence. Currently, there is a particularly ambitious energy sector budget in place from the federal government. The sector is clearly among the priorities for this government. There will be an investment in Pemex, CFE, and the possibility of private-sector participation to strengthen the major players' value chain. Energy investments also allow us to move more easily into other regions of the country. We are exploring opportunities throughout Mexico. We are also keen to link up with other universities and research centers throughout Mexico and are already achieving this. We already have links with the IPN and UNAM. We are linked with national and international companies, and all this makes us highly dynamic. We have operations in Tabasco, Veracruz, Tamaulipas, and the city of Mexico. Our university is motivating more students to choose Mérida as their new home. Many students are considering ITPE for the training of specialized human resources in the sector. Today, we have 200 students with an ambitious growth projection. We are set to grow by between 25% and 30% in recruitment in contrast to 2018.</p><h4>What projects are you collaborating on in the real estate and construction sector?</h4><p>The group has participated in a large real estate company that has seen the issuance of a CKD in the Mexican Stock Exchange through our president Emilio Dí­az. The group seeks to have a portfolio of medium-sized projects, particularly in Mérida and Playa del Carmen. Soon we will undertake a project in the Yucatán Riviera. We will offer a product of the highest value and level for locals and visitors who like to enjoy Progreso and offer added value, as there are no luxury resorts in this beach town.</p><h4>What is your vision for the southeast of Mexico?</h4><p>There are extraordinary opportunities in development. The additional investment that the federal government is set to make will detonate the region's economy. Large companies are looking to the southeast, which means employment, investment, and development. We have great faith in the energy sector. Yucatán has always been isolated from the rest of the country on the energy issue, and we face a major challenge with natural gas. We hope to collaborate with the authorities to work on this. We expect investments in gas pipelines and fuel storage terminals. Yucatán will register the highest growth in the country. We are making investments in storage because the country needs the capacity, especially now that the authorities are paying attention to energy security. For that, storage is crucial. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[to-be-the-best]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does GINgroup contribute to the human talent market in Mexico?</h4><p>Our company has been able to grow extensively over the last year, and we would like to see this growth reflected in our country. In 2018, Mexico did not grow more than 2%, while GINgroup reached 28%. According to our data, we will grow an additional 25% in 2019. We expect to close 2018 with MXN32 billion (USD1.7 billion) and MXN38 billion (USD3 billion) in 2019 in billings. No other company in Mexico has as many collaborators or employees as GINgroup. Our closest competitor has 66,000 employees. GINgroup is the fifth-most important employer in Mexico, after only Pemex, FEMSA, Telmex, and Walmart. This allows us to grow alongside the country and make sure our clients are highly satisfied. Once this is achieved, we eliminate the issue of rotation, which is one of the highest costs in terms of human talent. We generate an increase in production, so we produce higher profits; by producing higher profits we generate better wages, pay more taxes and dividend withdrawals, and invest in the company. We were ranked the 383rd-most important company in Latin America and the 122nd- most important in Mexico. Our goal is to continue growing and start the next six years with a positive attitude.</p><h4>What differentiates you from other companies that offer similar services?</h4><p>We have two important concepts. One is that we decided a long time ago to give the customer the service they need and require and only to pay for it once they are 100% satisfied. This has helped us minimize client losses year after year. We have clients that have been working with us for 10 years, which means great stability with the client, but there is a great deal of work behind this stability. Those who work with us are also given the opportunity to launch careers as accountants, lawyers, doctors, and economists. Once they complete their bachelors, we finance their further higher education, such as masters and doctorates. At this moment we have 350 people with scholarships, of which 10 are at the doctoral level. We prioritize knowledge and are imparting it to the people in the company. This makes us the best operator in Mexico and Latin America, and in three years we seek to become the best human talent administrator in the world. We have created a great payroll system that allows us to give our clients top-level service, no matter how many employees they have. Another difference is that GINgroup offers the entire recruitment process at no cost to the client, while other companies charge for that service. These solid structures between clients and companies have allowed us to create financial institutions called Sofomes, which are regulated by law and with which we support our clients in the issue of working talent, exclusively for financing payroll or staff control teams and staff support with loans for vehicles, homes, parties, or investment programs for retirement. By having our own bank, we could offer this service to all our clients and collaborators.</p><h4>What steps is the company taking to be the best?</h4><p>We have excellent support in communication and are already the number-two company in media, digital, and print. We have key partnerships with important publications. We also have alliances with radio personalities and business and finance outlets, though we seek an alliance with a medium abroad to be a reference in the field of human talent to publicize our efforts in the field. GINgroup is helping to educate small and medium-sized entrepreneurs so that when they start their business, they can become successful. If we succeed, Mexico can grow its GDP and generate more than 1 million jobs. The country needs to create 1 million jobs a year, a figure we are not reaching because of crime, emigration, and the informal nature of the economy. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does the chamber play in the Mexican economy?</h4><p><strong>HÉCTOR VILLARREAL MURAIRA COMCE </strong>Noreste was established in 1962 and has been a pioneer organization in promoting foreign trade, an initiative started by several business leaders. At the time, the Mexican economy was closed to the outside world, and we took a first step to help companies to boost imports and exports. Now, we have 126 member companies in COMCE Noreste. Some 80% are in the export or import business, around 10% are logistics firms, 10% are customs brokers, and there are other companies such as banks, industrial parks, and post service firms. COMCE Noreste includes the states of Coahuila, Nuevo León, Tamaulipas, and Durango. Hopefully we will add Chihuahua also in 2019.</p><p><strong>ARMANDO ORTEGA</strong> We are, by nature, a platform for Canadians to do business in Mexico, though our second function is helping Mexicans who want to do business in Canada. We are a business chamber and an easygoing organization that works with other chambers and institutions to achieve win-win deals. We act as the representatives of Canadian investors when handling their day-to-day issues in a country as complex as Mexico. These issues can be matters pertaining to security, dealing with local regulators or authorities, conveying their messages to the world, or interacting with other players in their sectors. Mining is one of the most important areas. At the same time, energy, including renewable energy, has not developed as extensively as it could. Another area is the manufacturing of the equipment and machinery needed in the mining and energy sectors. Finding suitable Mexican partners for Canadian investors is yet another area we want to enter.</p><h4>What are you doing to diversify Mexico's foreign trade from the US?</h4><p><span></span><strong>HVM</strong> We are in the north, so it is extremely attractive for us to export first to Texas and then to the US as a whole. However, we have been encouraging companies in the region to seek other markets. We have some great companies in Monterrey that export to Central and South America, as well as Asia and Europe. Right now, we want to boost exports to Central and South America, because it is a market of nearly 350 million people. We have also taken some steps to foster relations with China, and some Chinese companies have invested in Nuevo León as well. Many of them want to manufacture in Mexico and then export to other markets, focusing in the US. We have developed a program called 'Tu Puedes Exportar' (You Can Export) in which we held meetings with our members to help those that want to export. It addresses valuable information in areas like customs, certifications, marketing strategies, financing, and others. We have conducted a program for 20 SMEs with the Secretariat of Economy and Employment of the state of Nuevo León and are about to start a second program with 60 firms.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the new administration of Mexico, and what should be its priorities in terms of bilateral relations between Mexico and Canada?</h4><p><span></span><strong>AO</strong> The new administration is in an early stage of its kick-off. Some decisions on crucial projects, like the ill-founded cancellation of the new international airport, are not encouraging. It is therefore essential to maintain the country's economic stability; we must guarantee that everyone abides by the rules of the game, and there will not be any surprises or unexpected changes of plan. Five new ministers visited Canada in October, the second visit for some of them, and they have realized Canada is a trustworthy partner, a friend of Mexico, and a geopolitical ally. We hope the new Mexican administration has a long-term vision for the country and that it is based on the rule of law, respect for democratic values, and cohesion between different stakeholders in a country as complex as Mexico.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What makes Monterrey and Nuevo León so successful?</h4><p><strong>LORENZO GUSTAVO AGUILAR CAMELO</strong> Monterrey, Nuevo León, is an industrial destination by nature. The working culture in Nuevo León is more than 150 years old. The “regiomontanos" are not only those who were born here but also those who migrated to Nuevo León. Just as many people dream of going to the US, there are many Mexicans who dream of coming to Nuevo León because it offers them more opportunities. Nuevo León has been a state and Monterrey, specifically, a city that has had a bigger and faster economic growth than the infrastructure. Fortunately, advancements are being made and the current federal government announced a joint project with “Metrorrey" to build a new railway to connect the city from end to end, which will make the city even more competitive and more attractive for living.</p><p><strong>DAVID CABALLERO SÁNCHEZ </strong>The government of Monterrey has done decisive work in the regulatory improvement of the processes. In October 2017, we started the roll-out of the System for the Rapid Opening of Companies (SARE) that allows micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises to be opened in only three days by granting licenses for building purposes through a unified application. This allowed companies to overcome bureaucratic and legal obstacles regarding the setting-up of a business in Monterrey. As a result, the procedures, the time, and the cost involved in the creation of a company were streamlined and improved. We now have a more favorable regulatory environment, which has a positive impact on business in the city and the attraction of domestic and foreign investments.</p><h4>What new initiatives do you have in place to support further economic growth?</h4><p><span></span><strong>LGAC </strong>We have planned a visit to China, specifically the Zhejiang region. It is the Chinese province that resembles Nuevo León, as it is extremely industrial, with strong work culture and technological development. Nuevo León is home to the Hofusan industrial park, a project by two large Chinese companies and other partner shareholders from Nuevo León. There is space for more than 100 companies focused on Chinese investments. It is the first Chinese industrial park in Mexico. We currently have around 240 companies in our investment portfolio. On top of that, we have excellent prospects from other Asian countries, such as South Korea and Japan. As there are important companies already established here, suppliers from those countries also come to best serve their clients.</p><p><span></span><strong>DCS</strong> The Municipal Development Plan 2019-2021 of Monterrey, aligned with the employment and economic stability strategies, focuses on strengthening the attraction of investments, opening of new businesses, consolidating and developing companies, enhancing the positive impact on the labor market to generate more and better-renumbered jobs, and strengthening the tourism profile of the city. We are developing new initiatives such as Impulso Regio (Microloans), job fairs and employment workshops, training for self-employment, entrepreneurial coaching, incentives, business events, and commercial missions, among others.</p><h4>What has been the feedback from foreign companies established in Nuevo León?</h4><p><span></span><strong>LGAC</strong> As part of our new area of “aftercare" services, we seek to also pay attention to those already based here. We have noticed interesting trends, and one of them that plants in our state tend to outperform. For example, Lego has four manufacturing processes, and the only factory in the world that has all four is Nuevo León. Carrier has five plants in Nuevo León, and all five of them have received awards for their performance. Kia opened a factory a few years ago, and it has become the most productive in some areas.</p><h4>What role does attracting foreign companies play in the revitalization of downtown Monterrey?</h4><p><span></span><strong>DCS</strong> The municipal government has become an active promoter of urban development through new collaboration schemes that stimulate private investment needed the most. Downtown Monterrey is being regenerated according to the urban development plan. Work is also being done to attract national and foreign companies so that they can settle in this area of the city. We will do the above together with entrepreneurs and a wide range of chambers of commerce. We will carry out commercial missions within and outside the municipality, support investors with procedures and services, and manage the granting of municipal incentives.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In 2018, Nuevo León's economy outpaced the Mexican economy, and Nuevo León was the top recipient of foreign investment. What factors contributed to these results?</h4><p>The Secretary of Economy and Employment of Nuevo León reported solid economic growth of around 3% in 2018, record-high FDI, as well as a surge in the manufacturing and construction industries. Exports amounted to around USD40 billion in 2018, and the automotive sector registered the highest participation in that total, with 34.9% of that amount. Among the contributing factors is the availability of a highly skilled labor force and Mexico's privileged geographical location close to the US, particularly the border crossing in Anáhuac, which is the point of entry of many Mexican exports and the most important for cattle exports to the US. Another advantage is our internationally acclaimed universities, such as ITESM and UANL. These are in addition to an excellent cluster system in the state, globally competitive companies, solid infrastructure, modern industrial parks, two international airports, research centers, and advanced training programs.</p><h4>There has been an increase of 127% in FDI. What sectors or projects have received this?</h4><p>The state received USD4.2 billion in FDI in 2018, representing a 127% increase YoY. The state had 13% of the total FDI in Mexico in the last year. In 2018, companies like WeWork, LS Automotive, Renishaw, Conduent, and Digital On Us invested in Nuevo León, generating new and better jobs. Economic growth is also due to reinvestments of companies already based in Nuevo León, which is still attractive, and has seen inflows of FDI from 515 companies. Most of the investment comes from the US, which represents around 56% of FDI, followed by Argentina, with 16%, Spain with 8%, and the Netherlands with 6%. The main sectors participating in FDI are advanced manufacturing, the automotive industry, commerce, and services. The transport equipment manufacturing industry represented 40% with USD1.7 billion. Other sub sectors, such as the basic metal industry, which represents 15.6%, the beverage industry with 8.8%, and electric generation with 8.4%.</p><h4>In 2017, Business Nuevo León was launched as a way to promote the internationalization of the state's economy. How have the first few years been for the initiative?</h4><p>The administration led by governor Jaime Rodrí­guez Calderón established as a policy in the state's development plan to generate opportunities for growth, employment, and the reduction of poverty. Attracting new national and international investments is key, and the plan aims to promote Nuevo León as a competitive and attractive destination for investments. Business Nuevo León is a brand that identifies as the promoting agency for investment and has different government agencies involved in its objective.</p><h4>The model to attract FDI to Nuevo León is based in creating an optimal climate to do business. How are you working to strengthen this model?</h4><p>For many years, we have been creating a working culture, a DNA to be an industrial capital. We are proud of the triple helix model, in which we created the 13 clusters to boost growth in the strategic economic sectors for the state such as automotive, appliances, aerospace, energy, nanotechnology, information technologies, interactive media, housing, and health. Nuevo León also has the largest network of industrial parks, with around 130. The entrepreneurial muscle, qualified labor, infrastructure, business climate, cluster systems, universities, and geographic location are strengths that attract business.</p><h4>What are your priorities for 2019-2020?</h4><p>We seek to maintain the state's leadership status as the most competitive in the country with an intelligent economy, excellent growth, and employment for its 5 million inhabitants. We will continue promoting Nuevo León abroad as a state with solid infrastructure, social peace, and safety to attract more investments, continue to bet on strategic sectors, support the development of SMEs, and position the state as a leader for Industry 4.0 in North America. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has San Miguel de Allende positioned itself as a premium tourism destination in the center of Mexico?</h4><p>Tourism activity in our city started in the middle of the last century when some veterans from the US came when the American government offered them benefits to study. At the time there were two artistic centers: the School of Fine Arts and the Allende Institute. The artistic scene started gaining prominence. Important figures from the Mexican art world such as Siqueiros visited San Miguel to give classes and decorate murals. The first boom made tourism to San Miguel chiefly cultural and artistic. More steady inflows of tourists started in the 1950s and 1960s. At that time, it was very focused on foreign tourism, and there was a lot of immigration into the city from people to start business on tourism. National tourists started arriving in the 1980s. Today, San Miguel de Allende stands out because of the number of cultural events and traditions that remain within the population couple with an exquisite taste for fine arts. The Tourist Council of San Miguel de Allende was created in 2005 with the aim of raising awareness of the city's vivid cultural life in the country and abroad. Since then, the number of tourists has gone from 700,000 to almost two million per year in the last 15 years. It is a quite accelerated growth that has been backed by the large investments of world-class top hotels such as Rosewood, Matilda, and Aqua. However, the balance between local and international hotels has remained sustainable, with only 30% being international.</p><h4>What has been the economic impact of tourism on San Miguel de Allende?</h4><p>The city has a 2% tax on accommodation, which is used to invest and ensure it retains a desirable standard of living. In the past few years, the GDP of San Miguel was approximately USD461.2 million, 54% of which was from services, mainly tourism and commerce. After that, we have agro-industry at 10.6% and manufacturing at 6.5%. However, tourism is clearly a great driving force for the rest of the economy.</p><h4>How has the influx of foreigners, mainly retirees, been received by the local population?</h4><p>San Miguel de Allende has approximately 180,000 inhabitants. Of those, 80,000 live in La Cabecera, 14-17,000 of which are foreigners, mainly North Americans. That has affected much the culture of the city, but they are well integrated. Americans and foreigners began to arrive more than 70 or 80 years ago, and they have greatly contributed to the local community. Many came as retirees and were dedicated to civic associations. Thanks to that activity, San Miguel has 120 registered NGOs today, one of the highest per capita in Mexico. These contribute to social, cultural, and environmental purposes, among others.</p><h4>How are other economic activities being promoted at the city level?</h4><p>We are trying to take advantage of San Miguel's regional positioning. We are in an important area of the automobile industry, while agribusiness also offers great potential, especially in the modernization of techniques such as greenhouse work or drip irrigation. Conserving natural resources is also a priority, so we need to be careful about which industries we promote to come here. The city has an industrial park that today boasts 28 companies and is set to undergo an expansion plan to double its current size. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has León flourished within the investment ecosystem of the Bají­o region?</h4><p>In León, we have a spirit of entrepreneurship and work at all levels. The unions are oriented to productivity and quality because they have understood that productivity and sustainability bring improvements to working conditions. León is also oriented toward long-term planning; its first Municipal Institute of Planning was created 25 years ago. This institute guides diagnoses, strategies, and long-term plans with a vision of continuity. The participation and involvement of citizens are important, which is why our planning processes involve a citizen council. We have 32 councils in total at the municipal level addressing topics such as mobility, waste management, and security. Adding to that, in León we firmly believe in institutions. The first way to give certainty to the national or foreign investor is through certainty. We work to create elements of institutionality and respect for the law that provide confidence to investors. A city's liveability and quality of human capital are hugely contingent upon security, which is why this administration is always sharply focused on the best national and international practices.</p><h4>Have you seen much recent FDI?</h4><p>Guanajuato as a whole has investments from 18 countries, the biggest of which are the US, Japan, Germany, and Italy. Italy has a long history in sectors such as footwear, chemicals, and tanneries, while Germany and Japan have excelled in the automotive sector. Over the previous triennium, we established a goal of raising USD2.5 billion in productive foreign investment, which we fulfilled. In 2019 to date, we have 22 new projects with an amount of USD435 million and more than 5,000 jobs. Within these, 13 are industrial projects, eight are service, and one is commercial. One of León's weaknesses used to be that it did not have an industrial park. Today, we have seven, with a total infrastructure and services area of 1,300ha. This will allow us to house these investments in suitable places, take care of sustainability and security, and have the elements of service and availability to facilitate access to population centers.</p><h4>Which industries find León an optimal place for their investments?</h4><p>León has three characteristics that make it very strong. First, we have all the technologies related to plastics, such as injection, rotomolding, and thermoforming. Second, we have a great specialization in metal-mechanical manufacturing. Third, the people of León are skilled. These ensure the development of a significant number of industries. Obviously, given the environment of the automotive industry, many of its components are being developed here, as well as companies that supply the automotive sector. Other sectors in León closely related to plastics are food, agriculture, greenhouses, quilts, and irrigation systems. Adding to that, we see a lot of potential in biotechnology, especially biotechnology applied to healthcare, given that we have the needed components. Our public and private hospital infrastructure are also excellent, while our medical school is one of the most prestigious in Latin America. Moreover, we have one of the world's best optics research centers, in addition to a center for research and technology assistance applied to development that works with biomechanical engineering.</p><h4>What are the main economic objectives of the 2018-2021 administration?</h4><p>As a reelected administration, we want to keep delivering the same level of results. In the economic area, the objective is to reach USD2.5 billion in investments. We are so far on track to do so, as we have supported 22 new companies to set up shop in León. The economic team from the state of Guanajuato and the municipality of León will also actively engage with their counterparts in Asia to raise awareness about the benefits of companies being established here. At the end of the day, we also want to simplify the regulatory environment, which has tended to be monodisciplinary and vertical. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What opportunities should Mexico take advantage of with trade partners outside of the US?</h4><p>Mexico is the most open country in the world, with 48 trade agreements. Our trade balance with the US and Canada is impressive, at nearly USD1 trillion, the largest in the world. We are an open economy and promote open trade with no restrictions. We have had the change with Trump, who came in and disrupted in a negative way by working with a completely ignorant economic position by forgetting that trade is a win-win situation for both economies. He is completely wrong in his position, which poses a serious threat to Mexico's development. This is why we are already working with new partners on new trade deals. Fortunately, after negotiations and discussions we reached a new NAFTA for what will hopefully be the next 25 years, though merely a week later Trump was threatening everything again and saying he would close the border for automobile imports and impose tariffs. We have to be on guard at all times now and maintain the diversification process.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2019?</h4><p>For 2019, we will possibly see the American economy slowing down, which immediately affects Mexico and all of Latin America. We do not have high expectations for growth in 2019 because of that reason, though Mexico has a strong economic position together with the US and Canada. We also have the strongest and largest manufacturing cluster in the region, larger than the rest of Latin America. Mexico is extremely competitive and has a strong economy that always respects the fundamentals with interest and inflation rates under control. This guarantees us a positive future ahead though we have two major problems: corruption and violence. They are linked together because the cartels are so strong economically that they can corrupt government authorities, municipalities, governors, and members of the armed forces. It is extremely difficult to compete with the powerful cartels that operate in Mexico, as they get USD55 billion from the US market. This makes them more powerful than many economies in Latin America, and we have to compete with that, which is the biggest challenge Mexico has to overcome. Legalization will be extremely crucial in the fight against the drug cartels, as taking the plant away from them is part of the solution, and through legalizing cannabis we will stop crime, violence, and cartels.</p><h4>How have you seen a change of perception of cannabis as a medical tool in Latin America?</h4><p>In my time in government, there was no other choice than prohibition and illegal markets, so there was no evaluation of what happened before. It only developed the use for illegal purposes, which complicated the situation in Mexico and generated extreme violence, especially given the product's transit from Colombia, Peru, and Venezuela heading north, a migration that included all drugs. That brought a tough war to Mexico. It was not until recent times, after I left politics and became an activist promoting openness and the legalization of markets, that legalization as a trend has gained a lot of traction. Since this will not reverse, we are all getting ready to accelerate the development of the market. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your main commercial and diplomatic objectives in Mexico at the moment?</h4><p>Chile and Mexico have strong ties that go way back both on the commercial and cultural fronts. Both countries share the same perspective on how the world should be, and Latin American countries have a unique geopolitical job. One of the things we have to focus on is helping each other. Mexico has a brand-new government with many changes to come. We are witnessing this from a unique point of view and are interested in whatever path Mexico takes. We look forward to having a great deal of collaboration in many issues, including transparency in government and fighting corruption and drug cartels. One of the most important aspects is understanding Mexico's experiences so that we can cope with similar issues in our own country, and vice versa. We have been working with some of the states in Mexico through the Chilean Embassy, and the governors have been interested in sharing their experiences regarding policing with us. In 2019, we will celebrate the 20th anniversary of Mexico's first FTA, which was with Chile. It was one of Chile's first FTAs as well. It has been working extremely well, though the world has changed significantly since, and we need to update the treaty. This will have to be on the agenda of both governments in 2019.</p><h4>How has geopolitical volatility deepened the ties between Chile and Mexico?</h4><p>Both countries should take a look east and west to deepen relationships; for example, Asia is an important part of the world for Chile. Our strategy has been to turn to the Pacific Ocean and stretch our view all the way to the other side. There is China and India, as well as countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Myanmar. Even without India and China, there is a large market. Our cultures are all so different, and there is a great deal to learn and knowledge to be exchanged. Chile has been making a major impact exporting cherries, berries, and other products to China for the last three or four years. Mexico can now do the same, but bigger and better. Currently, the US accounts for 86% of Mexican exports. However, recent events show it is always wise to look in more than one direction. Chile's current biggest export market is China, at 24%. Then, we have the EU, Mexico, the US, and many other parts of the world. In this way, we seek to lower our risk and ensure that as a small country we can still survive and make things better for our own people even if the global economy is hit.</p><h4>What sectors and industries are you focusing on in 2019?</h4><p>On the commercial side, mining is still extremely important and a growing business between Mexico and Chile. We will not invest in mining in Mexico; we will leave that to the big players. However, Chile has a long history of mining, mainly copper. We have been able to develop experienced mining supply chain services in many different ways. Our biggest mining operation is state-owned, though the rest are all private. There are a huge number of SMEs in Chile providing services to the mining industry for many years, and there will be new opportunities for Chileans to invest in mining services in Mexico. In terms of other sectors, Chile exports a significant amount of fruit to Mexico. We do not have any problems in terms of competition with the fruit producers in Mexico, because our seasons are different; however, the service chain from our production to consumers in Mexico is slightly faster. We will have to look deeper into that as well, namely ports, transportation, and certification. This is a challenging issue, given that fruit is a perishable product. We have to ensure that the entire supply chain from the producer to the consumer runs smoothly. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Mexico's role regarding North and Central American dynamics, and how can Costa Rica and Mexico foster broader collaboration?</h4><p>In the coming months, I predict a stronger relationship between Mexico and Costa Rica. Historically speaking, we have always had an affinity, and there are regional matters that need to be worked on together, such as migration and developing the productive and agricultural sectors. The economic cooperation agenda between the US, Mexico, and Central America has been absent in past years, and we need to create closer rapprochement. I trust that the democratic and institutional strengthening within Mexico will enable a stronger partnership with Costa Rica.</p><h4>What are the main lessons Mexico can learn from Costa Rica concerning environmental matters?</h4><p>I do not want to be pompous and comment on what we can teach Mexico. There are many areas where both countries can learn from each other. Regarding climate change, there are great opportunities for countries to work together. Climate change is a global risk that will affect several generations.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>I want to share the main priorities of the secretariat that were established after a diagnosis of the growth of the economy in the long term. Toward the beginning of the 1980s, the Mexican economy changed its trajectory and experienced a steep decline in growth that affected the population, its needs, and social debt. And not only is growth low, but the fruits of that growth were concentrated in certain social sectors, regions, and branches of the economy. So, not only has there been a low percentage of growth, but an unequal one that was not divided throughout the country as a whole. Hence, we have developed a program for the Secretary of Economy that will not only reactivate growth at a sustainable rate but will also allow us to solve inequalities. We propose three pillars for the Secretary of Economy: innovation, diversification, and inclusion, which will complement each other.</p><p>On the subject of innovation, it is only through the adoption and incorporation of technology that we will be able to achieve high and sustained growth in the coming decades. Today, we are experiencing the fourth industrial revolution, and it will forever change the way we are used to conceiving the production of goods and services. As a society and country, we cannot remain outside of that revolution. That is why we believe that the Ministry of Economy has to create an ecosystem based on innovation. In other words, we have to bet on innovation and, at the same time, close the economic and social gaps that exist in our country.<br>The second pillar that we proposed for the secretariat has to do with diversification. Our trade is highly concentrated. The US represents 73% of our exports, and 57% of Mexico's imports comes from the US. This tells us we have space for diversification. We have signed free trade agreements with more than 40 countries, and that is where we must find space for commercial diversification.</p><p>SMEs have been left out of the opportunities offered by export, and we have to change this with an industrial and diversification policy that allows the formation of more integrated supply chains and global value chains. It is also worrisome that 81% of exports are executed in only 12 metropolitan areas, and the north is responsible for 59%. We have to make space for other regions in the country to export as well. To solve this, Mexico has to invest in logistics such as the rehabilitation of ports, roads, and connections. We have to integrate the country and its export strategy. It is a strategy that not only looks at exporting, but the entire value chain as well.</p><p>When proposing a new growth strategy, we have to include young people. We already have a very important program called Youth Building the Future. We have to educate young people to incorporate themselves in a better way into the economy, so that they have more jobs and better salaries. We have to integrate more productive sectors, have an aggressive policy of small, medium, and micro enterprises, and close the geographical gap of development. A successful growth strategy has to lead us to integration and inclusive growth that reaches young people, MSMEs, regions, and productive sectors. At the Secretariat of Economy, we believe that the welfare of Mexican society can be achieved through innovation, diversification, and inclusion. The work of the secretariat is a collective work. We believe we can push this momentum through policies that generate wealth for the country. If wealth is generated in the country and we facilitate the operation of companies, we will be in a position to promote diversification, innovation, and inclusion. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>I will announce to the people the following milestones achieved thus far by the government to realize Mexico's fourth transformation of public life.</p><p><span></span><strong>Foreign policy</strong></p><p>Our foreign policy is based on the constitutional principles of non-intervention, self-determination of all nations, peaceful resolution of disputes, refusal to use threats or coercions in foreign relations, legal equality across states, and international cooperation for the development, respect, protection, and promotion of human rights, as well as the fight for peace and international security. Our relationship with the US government has been cordial; we do not use aggressive language, but are dedicated to diplomacy and permanent communication. It is important to note that our neighboring government is committed to investing up to USD2.5 billion in our neighboring countries in Central America, in addition to USD3.8 billion in productive projects in our country, particularly in the south and the south east. This policy is part of a proposal to boost development from south to north to turn migration into a voluntary decision, instead of being an act forced by poverty, scarcity, insecurity, and lack of opportunity.</p><p><strong>Sound finance</strong></p><p>For the economy, we are applying the formula to put an end to corruption and impunity. These efforts will help us secure and obtain additional resources that can be used for the development and well-being of the people. That is the goal of our economic plan, basically. We seek to eliminate corruption and the privileges in order to obtain extra funds to finance the country's development. That is why we will not have the need to modify, and we will not do so under any circumstances, the macroeconomic balance. We will never spend more than the resources the treasury collects. We will not take on more debt to finance the budget. We will responsibly manage public finances. Taxes will not increase, and new taxes will not be created.</p><p><strong>Economy</strong></p><p>This year, according to Social Security data, 22,628 new jobs have been created and purchasing power recovery has been improving. In terms of domestic consumption, convenience and department stores report a 2.5% growth in their January sales compared to the same month the year before. I am proud to announce we have achieved an important agreement with the private sector and workers' representatives to increase the minimum wage by 16%, an increase in real terms the likes of which was not seen during the 36-year neo-liberalist period.</p><p><strong>Infrastructure projects</strong></p><p>Tren Maya will be an important construction project that will benefit the states of Quintana Roo, Yucatán, Campeche, Tabasco, and Chiapas. It entails the construction of 1,500km of new railway roads for tourists, national passengers, and cargo. The estimated investment will range between MXN120 billion (USD6.2 billion) and MXN150 billion (USD7.8 billion). And 300,000 direct jobs will be created just during the construction phase. In four years, once this important network is completed, we will have the capacity to transport 3 million visitors per year, and we will increase the arrival of tourists to the archaeological areas of the Mayan World and cities like Chetumal, Mérida, and Campeche.</p><p><strong>Energy vision</strong></p><p>We are optimistic because the corruption at Pemex and Federal Electricity Commission, although once tolerated, has come to an end. Thanks to that and to the austerity plans for the government and the aforementioned companies, we have increased our investment in oil production, refining, and energy generation.<br>In the past year, the investment budget for Pemex was of MXN185,830 million (USD9.6 million) It is now MXN272,627 million (USD14 million), which is nearly 46% more.<br>The Federal Electricity Commission had MXN37,200 million (USD1.9 million) in investment last year; now it has MXN61,000 million (USD3.1 million), 64% more.<br>We will have the capacity to process gasoline and diesel at the refineries of Salina Cruz and Minatitlán. We will use Pemex's existing oil pipeline to transport gas, we already have electricity, and to all of that we must add the fact that the isthmus will be entirely turned into a free trade zone; in other words, taxes and the price of energy will be reduced. That will facilitate the installation of new industrial parks that generate jobs and good salaries. All of that must have the participation and benefit for the people with absolute respect for the environment. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the potential of Ecuador-Mexico trade relations as Ecuador embarks on joining the Pacific Alliance?</h4><p>Ecuador highly values its relationship with Mexico, an important friend and commercial partner. The news of enhanced relations with Mexico as a consequence of Ecuador's entry into the Pacific Alliance has generated great expectations in our business community. The decision to join the Pacific Alliance has reinforced the confidence of our businessmen in the government's commitment to put aside dogma-based associations and resume ties with our true friends and natural partners. The Pacific Alliance is the most appropriate platform to introduce the new economic and commercial policy of Ecuador. Trade with Mexico will take place within the framework of the last generation agreement that covers all aspects of trade. The potential of an agreement with these characteristics is enormous since it will create new opportunities in new areas such as services, investments, and regional value chains.</p><h4>What steps has Ecuador taken to improve the climate for FDI?</h4><p>Mexico is undoubtedly one of the main investors in Ecuador, with almost USD1.5 billion invested between 2008 and 2017, which is 21% of the total and a growth of more than 800% in 2018 YoY. We want these figures to improve. Ecuador now offers legal security, and attracting and promoting investments have been declared state policy in order to ensure greater complementarity between the development objectives and the strategies to generate employment and promote the entry of foreign currency. We created a Strategic Committee for Promotion and Attraction of Investments that coordinates the institutions of the executive to promote, attract, facilitate, specify, and maintain foreign investment in Ecuador. It also approves investment projects and accompanies investments. We are currently working with the World Bank Group to improve the investment climate, objectively evaluate the rules that regulate business activity, and establish actions in the short and medium term to improve the indicators for doing business in the country. We have the support of the Inter-American Development Bank to implement a single window of investments in which it will be able to interact through a single point with the government entities involved in the investment processes. Finally, in August 2018, the Organic Law for Productive Development, Attraction of Investments, Employment Generation, and Stability and Fiscal Equilibrium, which includes a long-term economic stability plan for domestic and foreign investors, was made official. It also provides a series of incentives to attract new investments. This law will be complemented with a  Productive Development Law 2 that will include 27 new proposals for reforms in the fields of securities, productive entrepreneurship, business restructuring, development banking, public-private partnership processes, repatriation of capital, promotion of fishing and aquaculture activities, sovereign funds, and others.</p><h4>Moving forward, which sectors of the Ecuadorian economy could be more attractive to the eyes of Mexican investors?</h4><p>The commercial activities with the highest investment from Mexico are the manufacturing industry. Investments in transportation and communications exceeded USD60 million in 2018. Also, Ecuador has incentives to promote prioritized sectors including agriculture, food, metalworking, petrochemical, pharmaceutical, tourism, audiovisual, renewable energy, logistics services, biotechnology, software, and hardware. Likewise, investment in basic industries is being promoted, which includes the smelting and refining of copper and aluminum, steel smelting for the production of flat steel, the refining of hydrocarbons, the petrochemical industry, the pulp industry, and the construction and repair of naval vessels.</p><h4>Which other areas related to foreign trade are on the top of your agenda?</h4><p>Admission to the Pacific Alliance is a priority for Ecuador, and its realization will strengthen other aspects of the bilateral commercial relationship, such as productive linkages, the projection towards Asia, cooperation, and technology transfer. Trade is a powerful vehicle for regional integration and the creation of a sense of belonging to Latin America. Mexican President López Obrador is an affirmed Latin Americanist, and the interaction of both countries in a space of regional convergence will strengthen the ties not only between our governments but also among our peoples. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What added value does Guanajuato offer the country?</h4><p>Guanajuato is located in the center of the country. Many large cities are only a few hours away by land. We have two of the main roads in Mexico, routes 45 and 47. One road goes to Tamaulipas, Nuevo León to Nuevo Laredo, and the 45 goes in the direction of Jalisco and continues to Tijuana. These two important roads pass by Guanajuato. In terms of railway connectivity, Guanajuato is one of the few states, or maybe the only one, where both Ferromex and Kansas City pass. We are also extremely close to the Lázaro Cárdenas, Manzanillo, and Veracruz ports. We also heavily prioritize long-term planning and have an entire institution dedicated to this. There is a law that states that our long-term plan has to be updated every five years. We are used to this planning. New ideas have emerged, such as establishing a regional Pro-Mexico where we bet on joint investments, and we have already started to see results.</p><h4>Where does Guanajuato stand when it comes to its anti-corruption policies?</h4><p>Another of the advantages that Guanajuato provides is a transparent environment, particularly when attracting investment. Transnational companies are concerned about anti-corruption practices. They do not want to be subject to strange requests from local governments. We are one of the few states with a public policy of clear investment rules. Business in the state is not a conversation behind closed doors or with a public officer. Clear rules are published publicly. This gives certainty to investors. Guanajuato was named the least corrupt state in Mexico in the last INEGI survey in 2018. We are also always in the top three best justice systems. This shows that there is an extremely strong justice system.</p><h4>What is the objective behind the creation of the Centro-Bají­o Alliance in 2018?</h4><p>Globalization implies making alliances, and we set an example by establishing a pact with the states of Aguascalientes, San Luis Potosí­, and Querétaro. We also expect Jalisco to join soon. The alliance was signed in November in San Miguel de Allende and called the San Miguel Pact. We will be five strong states in the region that will have a plan to attract investments together. For example, BOS from Germany signed an important contract in Mexico and is now located in Guanajuato. We can use our regional alliance with the central state of the country to help BOS establish a successful supply chain. Instead of competing against each other, we can create alliances to become a potential force. These states hold great capacity for economic growth and attracting investment. Consequently, to attract investment, we can present a whole region, not only one state, along with the advantages from our relationships with the other governors.</p><h4>Considering the austerity measures in place, what kind of alternative financing model does Guanajuato plan to use?</h4><p>Guanajuato has a budget of MXN83 billion (USD4.3 billion) per year. In contrast to many other states, Guanajuato holds a healthy amount of debt and has the three highest qualifications from the three most important qualifiers, including Fitch Ratings. Guanajuato also has invested approximately MXN30 billion (USD1.59 billion) in malls, parking lots, and pharmacies. What we plan to do is create a state fund through a SOFOM that is regulated by the state. We will generate stocks through a regulated activity. We will have 49% of the stocks, and citizens will have 51%. This arrangement can prevent a corrupt governor from having more influence than individuals. In 15 years, we want to be financially independent enough to build a high-speed train for our inner railway network. We want to create a new model of prosperous government that allows us to be a state with its own resources, as seen in other parts of the world. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What edge does meeting DEA-level security protocols give a company trying to break into international markets?</h4><p>The pharmaceutical industry in the US is one of the most highly regulated in the world, and DEA regulates the controlled substance act through the Code of Federal Regulations, which mandates how any producer, distributor, prescriber, or dispenser of controlled substances adheres to the rules and regulations. DEA has the responsibility as the enforcement and regulatory agency, meaning it regulates the industry to the point where DEA personnel will visit different entities within the closed loop of distribution to ensure that those companies are operating in compliance. At Khiron, we are applying these regulations to the cannabis industry in Colombia and will do this within every country that we operate in so that we have consistent regulatory standards. </p><h4>What investment in equipment and training had to be made to meet these protocols?</h4><p>We are employing state-of-the-art technology in Colombia and our operations across the world. Talking about compliance, record keeping, security, and anti-diversion, we track and trace the entire chain. For us to comply with the regulations, we need to be able to track and trace every product. As a result of this, the company prevents misuse, abuse, and diversion from occurring throughout the supply chain. </p><h4>Have you experienced any unique challenges in Colombia to maintain these standards?</h4><p>We are utilizing technology that has been tried and tested in the US, including infrared and GPS tracking. It is really compliance that drives the business from the perspective that if we do not have the best compliance, it will affect our reputation negatively. We are extremely cognizant of compliance and spare no expense to ensure we are doing things to the levels that will carry our reputation to where we need it to be. </p><h4>What is Colombia doing right in its legal framework that can be an example to other places?</h4><p>We are extremely fortunate to have a member of our staff, Juan Diego Álvarez, be part of the process in bringing regulatory standards. As a result, the regulations were structured extensively with cooperation from the government. The way that the framework has been established is in a manner where the regulations are strict and controlled but at the same time businesses don't have a regulatory noose around their neck. Another positive aspect is regulators doing site inspections and monitoring our activities to ensure that we adhere to the regulations. Nonetheless, all factors are still evolving because medical cannabis has only been in the country for a year and a half; some regulations will need to be tested as the industry evolves and new products are dispensed. Notably, we have been fortunate to have the Canada Capital Markets behind us, which has set us apart as we became the first Colombian-based medical cannabis company to trade on any exchange globally.</p><h4>What is the potential for medicinal cannabis as an alternative to prescribed opioids?</h4><p>I have an extensive background in the opioid crisis in the US, and when I was Chief of Pharmaceutical Investigations, it was the beginning of the opioid epidemic to the extent that one could buy hydrocodone online without a prescription. On the other hand, cannabis is still illegal in the US federally, though there have been no cases of anyone overdosing on cannabis. On top of that, there are new medical researches that determine the medicinal value of cannabis. Opioid users in the US who can use cannabis legally are now taking cannabis and having great results. Although there are people in extensive pain that need opioids, for those who do not, cannabis provides a great alternative. It is quite a struggle still because even in states where cannabis is legal, cannabis businesses are unable to use banks. Khiron believes cannabis should be federally legalized because it will not only bring legitimacy and credibility to the industry, but also consistent regulatory standards.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have you rebranded your organization and how do you continue to offer your services?</h4><p>Najm is a company that has been around since 2007, doing accident reporting, insurance policy reconciliation, and serving as hub for the insurance industry. In March 2019, we unveiled a new corporate identity. This is changing the community's perceptions as we change the way we provide our services. Today, Najm is interested in moving forward to become more customer-focused and sales-driven, rather than just being an actively operational organization. Part of our liability determination services, which is one of the core lines of business that we provide, is basically to determine the percentages and ratios between the people who get involved in an accident, for example. And this is only the first step and happens when they contact us to resolve the matter in the field. Then we move to the next level, which is handling the policy. So, Najm by itself is going to be able to pull up the policy, identify who the driver is, and what his or her history is. Once Najm knows the other party, too, then at that stage we start processing all of those liability determination reports with the applicants' own insurance company. This is going to make it much easier for us to release the money to resolve the matter of the accident. This contributes to the quality of life for people who live in Saudi Arabia. Najm's approach is aligned with Vision 2030 in regard to full automation, AI, IOT, and machine-to-machine communications. We have successfully accomplished the automation of all our services including all claims handling processes such as accident reporting, customer complaints, objections to the accident reports, and other measures related to the process. We also want to have ready-to-apply innovative solutions like “scenarios creation" for accidents because we sometimes have trouble determining liability among the parties involved in an accident. This problem is going to be better resolved if we have more high-tech equipment and tools. We'll provide cameras for our officers and cars. Also, this will be part of quality assurance. We're working with our strategic partners to provide what they call “electronic assessment" of the damage, instead of going through the mechanic workshops. Besides, we're working together on trying to bring the appropriate damage assessment process. Najm is on track to becoming a Big Data company, and intends to use that to improve quality of life for people in Saudi Arabia.</p><h4>How do you envision using the data you collect for policy recommendations to improve road safety? </h4><p>Once you insure your car, you register with Najm, regardless if you have an accident or not. Najm provides what we call “non-organic growth." Our new strategy goes through other agencies as well, making Najm similar to a critic bureau style. We try to estimate the insured's likelihood for risk. This evaluation we do, based on the insured's track, would allow insurance companies to give the insured a no-claim discount. This is a big boost for us, because we have helped a lot of customers get lower rates. It is also noteworthy to point out that the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA) is the biggest driver behind Najm, in collaboration with the Ministry of Interior. They are really enabling Najm, as we are the only organization providing such services. On average, there are 4,000 accidents a day, therefore we manage a huge operation. With Big Data, we can help figure out what the best methods are to adjust the freeways or roads. We understand where the majority of accidents happen, therefore, we have applied the thermal map monitoring system for locating and improving the safety of roads with the highest number of accidents. On another level, we are making fraud protection a priority and working to raise the awareness of fraud . We are also engaging in strategic links with the leader companies in IT market, so we can utilize their solutions in improving the road safety and enhancing the efficiency and digitalizing the accident journey. Another area Najm was efficient at is the series of campaigns it has launched to raise awareness among the community. In 2018, we launched 'For Safer Roads' , a full-fledged campaign in three languages to alert drivers about the importance of following traffic rules. 'Drive Now' is another campaign to encourage female drivers to drive providing them with tips on safe driving. A third large-scale campaign was 'Insure it Right' which raised awareness among car owners on the importance of insuring their vehicles. These campaigns serve Najm's strategy to improve the quality of its services in terms of raising awareness on traffic accidents and promote traffic safety on the Kingdom's roads.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the consolidation in the insurance landscape?</h4><p>There are over 27 companies that serve the automotive industry, well-consolidated within Najm's infrastructure. We are connecting with each and every one of them. Every transaction that's related to an automobile comes to us. So we are already connected and integrated. We have a data hub for all the insurance companies, so all of them connect to us. We hope to extend our experience in this context to other insurance segments such as housing and healthcare insurance. I am certain that after we grow as much as we can in the automotive industry, we will try to extend our hands to help others.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>PPO was set up as an independent government body, with a unique role in the private sector. Can you elaborate on the main mandate and activities of your office?</h4><p>Vision 2030 has three main themes, one of which is a thriving economy. That includes building an economic model that is not entirely dependent on oil and glorifying non-oil government revenue as well. The private sector is a main partner in achieving this goal of a thriving economy. Because of that, in early 2017, the government decided through the private sector stimulus program to engage with the private sector at the ground level to ask how it could contribute more to the economy, for which more than 700 companies were consulted. One of the main obstacles the private sector identified a communication gap—which we believe is a global issue—is about how the private sector can communicate with the government and differentiating these lines of communication. PPO is one of several initiatives that were launched to remove the obstacles identified by the private sector. PPO started as a pilot in mid 2017, primarily focused on resolving communication issues. In our first six months, we freed up a large amount of willing investments that had been attracted here but were being stopped from proceeding due to certain communication challenges. When these investments were realized, the companies were pleased with the provided services, and this led to a royal decree in 2018 to officially establish PPO. Since its formation, PPO has been able to stimulate the private sector by facilitating the implementation of 18 strategic projects that have a substantial socio-economic impact and are expected to play a major role within the national economy. Moreover, it is estimated that the value contribution of these projects between 2018-2023 will be around SAR26 billion in investment, resulting in SAR27 billion in GDP impact, including the creation of an estimated 10,000 temporary jobs and 7,000 direct and sustainable jobs. This will bring about a high volume of exports and a reduction of imports, bringing in technology and knowledge transfer including the contribution to the increase of non-oil exports, localizing industries and supporting strategic sectors. In addition, other elements that enrich the local content of Saudi Arabia, also currently receiving a large number of similar strategic projects. Our team works together on the flow of cases by receiving, evaluating, and resolving them within a timely manner. We complement all governmental entities which means we do not attract investment or issue licenses. We just listen to issues and take them to other government entities in a language they understand to resolve them, bridging the communication gap between the public and private sectors. In cases that require multiple ministries and authorities to address and for some big investors, we have provided a red-carpet service to ensure their investment in the country. In order to support such large private-sector entities, one needs to be impartial and fair to resolve the communication holdup.</p><h4>What have been the most common issues you dealt with for companies, and how do you advise government entities to change their policies to improve future communication?</h4><p>PPO is not an agency the changes policies; rather, we modify the systems based on each case that is brought to us. For the government entities we work with, these are lessons learned. Our legal and financial teams have set up this structure of putting issues into a 'listen-and-learn form.' The government has other entities that are responsible for raising policy changes based on the resolution that we have applied including a collective effort from other relevant governmental stakeholders. The impact that strive for is seeing our private sector client satisfied and their investment aspirations realized. Based on the PPOs mandate we focus our efforts on strategic investments, so we are not at the stage to categorize trends at the sectorial level. When we do encounter companies having a similar issue, we usually take it to the Ministry of Commerce and Investment's Tayseer Initiative, because it works more on the sectorial level and can change its policies based on our recommendations. If we cannot solve an issue by ourselves because of our mandate, then at least we can share it with the relevant entity that can help them.</p><h4>PPO is an initiative within Vision 2030's Fiscal Balance Program. What synergies you strive for with other government agencies working within these objectives?</h4><p>If any of these programs or initiatives work independently, they cannot achieve their objectives. In today's government, everyone is on the same page, and we should always strive for synergies with all the parties involved. We all know our mandate. PPO clearly cannot play its role alone, because it is all about communication. We have signed MoUs with all relevant entities in the government to underline our cooperation and to ensure they understand we can mediate issues. We are very resourceful and channel oriented that gives us the ability to reach out to hindered investments; as example,  our workforce capacity is only around 10-15, but we are engaged with around 80 liaison officers who are working with us under this system to help in solving cases.</p><h4>What are your strategic priorities and ambitions for the coming year, and what is your message to global investors considering possible challenges to invest in the Kingdom?</h4><p>Initially, we believed three years would be enough to solve such problems and processes; however, in a short period we have gained the maturity that gave us a futuristic view of where the office will be and what needs to be done for the private sector. We started the office by encountering some issues, but now we consider ourselves as a trusted entity that can advise other public sector entities on the needed adjustments or new regulations covering certain points, for example in the digital sphere. The government will be doing some big investments with the private sector. There are many big projects underway and this where we come in at the front-end to provide concierge services. The important message we seek to send foreign and international companies is to assure them that with Vision 2030, everyone will get the treatment they should and deserve, and there is a team of experts serving investors to remove obstacles so they can go ahead with their investments. Our team is agile and creative, so we can find the solutions. By listening to more problems, we will be able to find more great solutions.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Saudi Health Council (SHC) is mandated to coordinate and integrate all stakeholders in the Kingdom to enhance public health and improve healthcare. Could you tell us more about your activities?</h4><p>SHC is mandated to implement the National Healthcare Strategy that was approved in 2009. One of the most important pillars of this strategy plan is to enhance healthcare in its comprehensive concept through insuring and developing primarily healthcare roles and services. In order to put this into practice, SHC conducted a nationwide public health study to detect the major gaps in the provision of public health services and define the roles and responsibilities of involved health and non-health sectors. We identified five major strategic directions to reinforce, support and enhance, based on evaluations which we have translated in the following policy objectives. First, to support the newly established Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that is responsible for public health protection. Second, to support developing an integrated law for this public health protection. Third, we focus on continuous monitoring of causes and risk factors for priority public health problems and related to that we provide an annual assessment of road accident problems, including an assessment of the risk factors and main causes, and make recommendations to the relevant entities. Furthermore, we work on preparing the National Survey to Measure Public Awareness and Degree of the Participation in Public Health Protection programs, while also organizing periodic public health press conferences. Finally, we created a list of research priorities in the field of public health protection and conducted an assessment of labor market needs.</p><h4>What is the role of SHC in the large-scale digitalization program in the healthcare sector, that includes the unified patient records and other programs?</h4><p>The SHC harbors the National Health Information Center (NHIC), which is the body responsible for national scale digitalization initiative within the NTP. One of the most critical and far-reaching initiatives is the unified health record. The NHIC is working closely with all service providers, including the Ministry of Health and the Council of Cooperative Health Insurance (CCHI) to support this project. The other landmark project is the data observatory, which will help the Saudi healthcare system in producing national level KPIs and thus, monitoring the progress and improvements on critical indicators.</p><h4>The public health objectives of Vision 2030 include two directions: to reduce infectious diseases and educate the population on using primary healthcare, and to address chronic diseases such as diabetes, cancer, and heart diseases. Could you elaborate on the main strategies in place to achieve these objectives?</h4><p>In addition to our general mandate of implementing the national public health strategy, we have recently established a health economics unit that is working closely with the World Bank in conducting national economic studies to understand the economic impact of diabetes, cancer and heart diseases and other disease priorities. Such studies will entice the production, revision, and monitoring of national policies address the burden of disease. In addition to health economics SHC has worked on the Health education and early detection national programs which are now implemented by different entities in addition SHC is working on establishing a collaboration center for evidence-based policy.</p><h4>From a regional perspective, how do Saudi health standards compare with other countries?</h4><p>Compared to countries in the region, the Kingdom has passed advanced milestones in terms of improving quality and patient safety. On a national level, Saudi Arabia has been able to develop the right governing structures that will set the standards, monitor compliance, and ensure major improvements in patient safety in its healthcare facilities. The Central Board of Accreditation Healthcare Institutions (CBAHI) has evolved significantly over the years. It is now providing accreditation programs that are on par with international ones. Similarly, the Saudi Patient Safety Center, the National Health Observatory, the National Quality Institute and the Saudi Food &amp; Drug Authority do great work in quality control. There is also great momentum on a health sector level, with the launch of a massive scale improvement program, ADAA Health, to improve efficiency, access and quality. The healthcare sector in the Kingdom witnessed huge improvements in health status for the past three decades, accompanied by a significant decrease in the spread of diseases. On average, death rates decreased by a third since the 1980s, while life expectancy in 2016 was 74.8 years, exceeding the regional average by six years and the global average by 3.4 years. It is up from 66 years in the 1980s. The infant and maternal mortality ratios also dropped significantly, while overall immunization for DPT, OPV, BCG, MMR, and PCV across the Kingdom increased from 95% to 98%.</p><h4>How are you internationalizing and benchmarking these quality standards?</h4><p>The Kingdom is taking solid steps to enhance the health status of its population, and it is one of the main objectives of the NTP. To operate in line with the transformation quality agenda, the SHC has worked on the National Quality and Patient Safety Development Program. Its main objective is to strengthen the health quality framework and strategy to ensure that national policies, guidelines and protocols around quality are reliably implemented, building on the extensive resources and infrastructure that the government has already put in place. Thereby accelerating Saudi Arabia's efforts to close remaining gaps in health outcomes and ensure care and equitable treatment for the country's diverse population. The national strategy is directly aligned with Vision 2030 to ensure that Saudi Arabia is equipped to manage the increasingly complex needs of a 21st century population.</p><h4>What are your strategic priorities and ambitions for the year ahead?</h4><p>We will continuously strive to improve the healthcare delivery system. Secondly, we aim to achieve financial suitability for our healthcare system. That includes exploring certain parts of the healthcare sector to become self-funding or privatizes. Last, we envision improving the overall performance and efficiency of our healthcare system.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>SRTI Park is the first major milestone of AUS Enterprise. Can you give us a short introduction of the development?</h4><p>SRTI Park, an initiative of the American University of Sharjah Enterprises (AUSE), was established in 2016 by royal decree of Sheikh Dr. Sultan bin Muhammad Al Qasimi, Member of the Supreme Council of the UAE, and Ruler of Sharjah. SRTI Park aims to develop and manage an innovation ecosystem within a free zone that promotes R&amp;D and supports enterprise activities and the triple-helix collaboration of industry, government, and academia. The park focuses on six verticals: water technology; digitalization; transport and logistics; environmental technology; renewable technology; and production, design, and architecture.</p><h4>The first phase is expected to initially accommodate 200 companies. What are the highlights of this achievement?</h4><p>Phase I of the park comprises three inter-linked buildings of some 60,000sqft and will house the park's headquarters, laboratories and innovation centers, and a host of start-ups, SMEs, and anchor companies that focus on contributing to the R&amp;D and innovation culture of the region. Future phases include a center of excellence, a technology museum, a hotel, a convention center, and housing units.</p><h4>How do you see the innovative R&amp;D sector growing and improving here?</h4><p>It is not surprising Sharjah has achieved a leading position on the international map. The Emirate has made education and science as the foundation for progress and development in line with the vision of Sheikh Dr. Sultan bin Muhammad Al Qasimi. Today, Sharjah is taking a step forward on the path of global leadership, supported by quality projects, notably SRTI Park, which marks the beginning of a new era of excellence in science, knowledge, and research.</p><h4>How is increasing digitalization becoming an increasingly hot topic affecting this development in Sharjah?</h4><p>The focus is now on the park for its future role as an economic catalyst for knowledge, innovation, and entrepreneurship, paving the way for Sharjah to be recognized as a global hub for Industry 4.0 by contributing to the shaping of future sectors, led by robots, drones, 3D printing, and smart transport. The park is unique as a nucleus designed to emulate the path of economic diversification, making the partnership between the public and private sectors an important strategic priority in order to increase spending on R&amp;D projects at all technical, social, and economic levels. The main features of the park are its solid pillars of technological progress in the service of community development.</p><h4>What is your strategy to showcase the park's strengths for FDI, and what makes SRTI unique to similar entities in the UAE?</h4><p>SRTI Park is working on developing an integrated business system for the smart industries in the Emirate in cooperation with international organizations. The Emirate has more than 21 industrial areas, and it wants to utilize this by collaborating in the fields of smart industries related to robotics and AI. Smart industries are part of the fourth industrial revolution in the world, and Sharjah plans to lead in this through research, development, and innovation. The community plays a pivotal social role by stimulating innovation, creativity, and spreading knowledge and technology in a community, providing talented young people with exceptional opportunities. It is not possible to talk about SRTI Park without mentioning the competitive advantages that will enhance the leadership of the educational environment in Sharjah on the map of scientific research, technology, and innovation regionally and globally. One of the main focuses is to support scientific research through SRTI Park and for it to be a hub for international research companies, researchers, students, faculty, and graduates of AUS.</p><h4>What was the strategy behind launching Sharjah's Innovation Economy Report?</h4><p>Based on a series of events and joint efforts between Sharjah stakeholders and the UK government, represented by Future Cities Catapult, this report highlights the next steps to be taken by SRTI Park to support the Emirate's journey toward establishing a knowledge economy and becoming the R&amp;D and innovation hub of the region. The book was launched earlier in 2019 at the UK-Sharjah Innovation Forum at the House of Lords in London, in cooperation with the UK government. Through this report, SRTI Park joins the global standards system for innovative cities. It will also play as a roadmap to the park during its next phase.</p><h4>What sustainability projects are you launching at the park?</h4><p>We make use of natural resources, from solar energy and salt water, high temperature, and humidity, to provide a source of irrigation for agriculture and to ensure the success of pilot projects by focusing on the importance of innovative farming methods and their many benefits compared to conventional methods of irrigation. The agricultural products of the urban population of the world, in addition to its role in the utilization of seawater covering a vast area, up to 70% of the globe. The research site specializes in the development of sustainability and natural resource conservation technologies offering innovative technological solutions for agriculture through the use of infrastructure in urban areas such as balconies, houses and terraces. These include the tower farm, a vertical agricultural system, and the horizontal farm technology, which is water-based. The project introduces a new concept of sustainable agriculture through the practice of using the principles of ecology, which is the study of the relationships between living organisms and their environment. One of the most important research areas in Merlin Digital's Sustainable Technologies Research Site is the sustainable water project, a solar desalination still that produces 10 times the amount of pure, distilled water per square meter per day from any source of contaminated water—seawater, groundwater, and others—compared to classic solar stills. The idea is to re-engineer solar distillation, a basic technology that humans have known for thousands of years.</p><h4>What are your main goals and objectives for 2019 and beyond?</h4><p>The park is a milestone in the pursuit of scientific research in the benefit of society, economy and humanity. It is based on an ambitious vision to enhance the UAE's and Sharjah's presence as a key player in shaping the digital revolution, technological transformation, and economic openness, offering a competitive edge to attract leading companies and the best minds and creative talents to undertake research and innovation activities that support the overall development.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[paula-couttolenc-coo-cmo-redus]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the motivation and reasons behind the creation of Redus?</h4><p>Redus is a result of an issue we faced as entrepreneurs. A few years ago, we needed to find a terrain to develop a building, the search process was difficult and time consuming. As for technology, we did not find the support we needed to find a solution. For example, the contacts on the ad pages were not answering the phone or they showed something online that physically was completely different. A large majority of the advertised properties online are frauds and can put investment at risk. Being in the real estate market is a great responsibility because buyers invest their wealth and savings into it. Real estate is often a once in a lifetime purchase. We wanted to develop a platform in the market that could offer a safe space to conduct these investments. Another thing that we noticed is that real estate brokers in Mexico do not require a title or a license to operate. At Redus, the people who are part of our team of real estate brokers, with or without previous experience, have all the tools to give the best service to our clients. We train our Representatives via online tutorials on the different topics and trends in the industry. We mix two of the most important businesses in the world: technology and real estate. Redus is the safest platform for buying, selling, and renting real estate. Anyone who is looking for a property to buy or rent can find it through us with all the security guarantees of a certified property.</p><h4>What verification process does the company use to prevent fraud?</h4><p>We have a strong team of attorneys who review each property. All advertised properties on our website are supervised by a team of lawyers that has already ensured all the papers are in order and that it is not a fraud. We rely on Mexican law. We certify each property according to what is required for the deed. The most important factor is knowing that the person offering the property has the real intention and means of selling it. People offer their property and put it on sale without realizing that maybe they cannot sell it. It makes a client wonder why it is even for sale in the first place if it cannot be sold. We want to avoid these situations in the real estate market. At Redus, we aim to be the bridge between the buyer and the seller. The company's headquarters are in Mexico City, where we have the strongest presence, but we are present all around the country.</p><h4>What challenges do you face when it comes to finding a property that can meet all the requirements?</h4><p>A great challenge that motivates us is to start changing the mentality of Mexicans. People here don't want to start doing the dirty work until they have a client, but it should be the other way around because the client is the king. Clients must have what they want, when they want it. In a world with as many options as now, delivery is important. Through the platform, customers and owners can have direct contact. This has received incredible feedback. They can negotiate directly without the intervention of an intermediary. To make an offer the buyer has to give 3% of what he is offering. This has worked incredibly well because the buyer has a true commitment. When there is money involved, it is much easier to close the deal. The owner, after seeing the money in between and the seriousness of the buyer, is driven to decide and speed up the processes. Our commitment is to deliver no matter what. That has made us win the trust of people.</p><h4>In what ways are you collaborating with developers?</h4><p>We have alliances with many developers but it can be a challenge as we only sell properties 100% ready to be sold. Developers often want to sell upcoming projects but this is against our policy. Our main goal is to offer security and certainty to the client. We only offer the client developments that are 100% tangible and completely built so that they can see, buy, and settle there. We do not want to risk the possible delay of a project.</p><h4>Between rent and sale, what type of properties have the highest demand?</h4><p>It depends. People are more economically reserved because of the current prices in the market. The rental market always offers much more flexibility in terms of prices. For example, the amount of documentation required to rent a property is 5% of the documentation required to purchase a property. So in this fast-paced world, renting has become the go-to solution.</p><h4>What is your vision for the market considering the disruption that your application is in the real estate industry?</h4><p>At Redus, we are always looking for innovation and creativity. It is the spirit of the brand. We want to break paradigms, offer something new, and solve problems. In the long term, we seek to eliminate bureaucracy and the obstacles that the face-to-face world presents to businesses. Real estate agencies do a great job but the area of opportunity is in technology. We seek innovation in order to move forward with the market. For example, taxis used to be a global monopoly but platforms such as Uber or Cabify have disrupted that. Our current vision of Redus is to be a platform with all the technology that understands the market and moves forward with it. For companies that have been around for years, it is very difficult to move. Recent companies have the possibility of taking a 180-degree turn and move with the market. In a world like today, if you do not move forward with the market, you stay behind.</p><h4>How do you plan to expand what the platform offers?</h4><p>We have a mobile application that can be downloaded for free for Android and iOS. In this application, anyone interested in buying any type of property (from office spaces in the city to houses on the beach) can find it with all the certainty of knowing that what they are buying is validated and backed by a team of professionals. We also have an exclusive application for our Representatives, that is practically a virtual office.</p><h4>What role does Redus strive to have within the Mexican economy in the long term?</h4><p>We are starting with real estate but Redus is a platform that connects buyers and sellers and ensures a safe transaction through technology. In the future, we see Redus selling practically any product that a buyer and a seller wants. We call ourselves Redus and not “Real Estate.com.“ Taking as an example Amazon, the world largest e-commerce platform. Amazon started by selling only books, but if Jeff Bezos had named Amazon "Books.com," Amazon would not be the most successful platform in the world. In the future, Redus will be able to carry out any purchase-sale transaction. We believe that technology has no limits and Redus is the living proof of that. In the short and medium term, we are focused 100% on the real estate sale but we have strong technological infrastructure that in the future could give life to a platform where you can sell or buy any product digitally.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does Dow Saudi position itself as an innovative player in the material science sector, and what role does Saudi Arabia play within its portfolio?</h4><p>On April 1, 2019, Dow completed the spin off from Dow-DuPont, positioning itself as a leading material science company with the ambition to be the most innovative, customer-centric, inclusive, and sustainable materials science company in the world. Dow's focus on sustainable growth at a global level transcends to the regional and local level. In Saudi Arabia, we have introduced products that have been launched in the kingdom for the first time through Sadara Chemical Company, our joint venture with Saudi Aramco. Dow's Middle East Innovation Center is located in Thuwal, enabling our Company to provide application development and technical services focused on oil and gas, sustainable coating and construction products, and industrial chemicals for a variety of applications relevant to our customers in Saudi Arabia and the broader region.<br>The most invaluable investment in any country is in human capital, which we do by giving many young Saudis the opportunity to develop their skill-set and careers, such that they can contribute to Saudi Arabia's economy.</p><h4>What was the driver behind choosing Saudi Arabia as the location for the second digital center within Dow's portfolio, and what are the center's main goals?</h4><p>Saudi Arabia has been at the forefront of investing in its young human resources. Its population not only provides a huge pipeline, but talented students too. As such, we continue to recruit young Saudis to work in our new Digital Marketplace Center located in Thuwal, on digital market solutions such as data visualization, social listening, finding solutions for customers, and addressing today's challenges. The digitization of the entire commercial process has become essential, as more and more customers expect close partnership and collaboration versus just a transactional relationship. Providing innovative solutions, reducing overall costs, and engaging closely with customers is how we, as a materials science leader, can make business easier for our customers and stakeholders in Saudi Arabia.</p><h4>How does Dow Saudi Arabia's plans to invest in coatings reflect the major opportunities in the local petrochemical sector, and what are other attractive areas for international investors to engage in?</h4><p>The Downstream industry, especially through value parks, achieves many of the goals set by the Kingdom's Vision 2030. The Government's construction projects which are coming up and Aramco's substantial investments to expand gas capacity and gas infrastructure create an opportunity for those seeking to do business in Saudi Arabia. The coatings plant we are building aligns with the growth of the local and regional construction sector, in a market which has one of the largest consumer, infrastructure and construction base in the region.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: justify;">The creation of the Abu Dhabi Department of Energy marked the decentralization of regulatory and service provision aspects of energy in the emirate. Can you tell us about the vision behind this government reform?</h4><p>The overall objective of the government of Abu Dhabi is to have a sustainable utilities and sanitation sector that ensures optimal usage of natural resources. This effort builds on Abu Dhabi's economic vision, issued in November 2008, with the aim to develop a sufficient and resilient infrastructure capable of supporting anticipated economic growth. Therefore, a key part of the emirate's success will be how well the needs of business, industry, and consumers can be met by the provision of electricity, water, and wastewater services. The vision also issued Law No. 11 of 2018, which establishes a Department of Energy (DoE) that focuses on developing a strategy for the energy sector, issuing policies and regulating companies active in the energy space. Law No. 3 of 2019 activates Abu Dhabi Power Corporation as the asset owner for the emirate's electricity and water assets. As the energy and water sector's transition develops, the clear separation between the asset owner, on the one hand, and the policy-maker and regulator, on the other, will ensure that Abu Dhabi is able to balance the competing interests of what we refer to as the 'energy trilemma' — the security of energy and water supply, sustainability of the energy sector, and ensuring the lowest costs to end-consumers. Additionally, Abu Dhabi is introducing non-fossil fuel generation, decoupling desalination, and adopting new technologies. Alongside its regulatory responsibilities, the DoE is creating new water and energy strategies and policies to deliver these outcomes and is therefore well-placed to ensure that Abu Dhabi succeeds in this energy transition.</p><h4>What role does the Department of Energy envision for public-private partnership (PPP) in driving the development of the energy sector?</h4><p>The Department of Energy continues to see public-private partnership as playing a crucial role in the development of a sustainable energy market, in particular given the focus on cost-competitiveness and end-use efficiency. The local energy market in Abu Dhabi is becoming increasingly complex as a result of factors like nuclear energy, renewables, and the de-coupling of water co-generation entering the energy mix. Furthermore, private investors lay a great deal of emphasis on certainty, and the Department of Energy can play a pivotal role in creating a conducive environment for their investment. As the policy-maker and regulator for the energy sector in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, the Department of Energy is responsible for fostering creativity and reducing risk. This is especially relevant in the area of clean and renewable energy, where there is little experience at the emirate-level at the moment.</p><h4>By the second quarter of 2019, DoE will have overseen the creation of one of the world's largest solar power plants. What challenges will Abu Dhabi face in increasing the solar share in its energy mix?</h4><p>In most developed markets like Abu Dhabi's, the first wave of renewable capacity can be integrated into the wider system without difficulty, and this is what we have been seeing with the Sweihan Photovoltaic (PV) Independent Power Project (IPP). As the scale of PV rapidly increases, however, we will start to face new and interesting challenges. They are not unique to Abu Dhabi, but none of the international models we have examined thus far have found perfect solutions. Everyone is still experimenting and learning. Solar PV, however, is only one part of a broader energy transition for Abu Dhabi. We have to position our targets and policies so as to remain agile and able to take advantage of innovations as they become viable, without locking ourselves into particular technologies in a way that we might come to regret in the future. There is still uncertainty and competition between potential solutions, such as various forms of energy storage and power-to-gas, and we do not want to place our bets too early. We also anticipate new opportunities to manage demand. As smart devices and electric vehicles become mainstream, they could provide some of the flexibility services that we will need. Water will also become a form of virtual energy storage and demand-side management, as we shift production of desalinated water from new reverse-osmosis plants towards the middle of the day, when energy from PV is most abundant. So perhaps the challenge is not whether we can make the system flexible enough to accept much more PV, but rather finding a way to make all the parts work together efficiently.</p><h4>What does the DoE's new integrated energy model bring to Abu Dhabi's energy sector?</h4><p>The Department of Energy has developed a holistic energy model that captures the full, end-to-end energy value chain within Abu Dhabi Emirate against the wider context of the UAE. Covering a time horizon up to 2050, this model provides analysis that will support policy choices and development in all energy-related matters. The ambition of this project is to work with our multiple government stakeholders to develop and maintain the energy model collectively and systematically. Upon completion, the model will be accessible to all government departments. The Department of Energy will then work across the government to test envisaged scenarios and support other departments' work and energy-related policy development. Having the whole energy ecosystem on one platform will provide valuable insight on Abu Dhabi's overall demand and supply balance, helping to identify the interplay and inevitable trade-offs to be considered between different government perspectives, outlook scenarios and subsequent policy choices. The energy model is designed with extensive demand segmentation across all major demand groups — transport, industry and buildings — which will be instrumental in facilitating energy and water efficiency measures. The model capabilities include granular segmentation of domestic consumer behaviour, which allows for testing the different dynamics and opportunities for energy efficiency separately in residential and commercial sectors. This will better enable us to understand the effect of specific and targeted individual efficiency measures, as well as their aggregated effects over time, and to assess these measures in terms of their energy savings, cost, and CO2 reduction.</p><h4>What are the main things that private sector companies looking to participate in Abu Dhabi's energy market over the next five years should bear in mind?</h4><p>Abu Dhabi's energy sector is on the cusp of major transformation. The role of the Department of Energy will be to provide direction and a clear vision for the sector, and the private sector will need to play a critical role in delivering the transition. Our work plan in the coming years will therefore be directed to ensuring that energy is provided in an efficient and affordable way, to promoting the transition to clean energy, and to ensuring that everyone is aware — and accountable — for using energy responsibly. The Department of Energy wants to strategically partner with relevant stakeholders, public entities, academia, and the private sector to share our experiences and knowledge, and to achieve our sustainable energy goals. Innovation and technology will be equally critical to ensuring that our energy transition is achieved while maintaining affordability and security of supply to the greatest possible extent. For example, in the near future we expect innovation to address challenges in terms of costs and system flexibility arising from the integration of nuclear and large-scale PV. We expect the most innovative solutions to cover energy areas such as new technology enablers (e.g. storage, electric vehicles, block chain, and smart grids), business models (e.g. aggregators), system operation (e.g. distributed energy and digitalization), or market design (e.g. wholesale markets, pricing signals, and ancillary service markets).</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The government has presented an ambitious tax reform that aims to reactivate the Colombian economy. How does it work to improve Colombia's attractiveness for FDI? </h4><p>When our government took power, we inherited a difficult situation and low expectations of economic growth in the medium and long term, reinforced by the low rate of economic activity that was evident at that time. These situations put Colombia in the sights of ratings agencies, to the extent that Standard &amp; Poor's reduced the country's credit rating at the end of 2017, and Moody's changed the rating outlook from stable to negative at the beginning of 2018. Faced with this situation, we had to present a clear plan for economic reactivation during the next four years to businessmen, local and international investors, and even ratings agencies, and the reception was very positive. This was fundamental in order to quickly give assurances that this government has a well-defined structural economic reactivation strategy based on the promotion of private enterprise, support for the free market and innovation, fiscal austerity, formalization, and firm commitment to seek equity as a central objective. What was the immediate effect? That two of the main ratings agencies ratified the credit rating of the country at investment grade. These were the first steps we considered necessary to improve confidence and accelerate the recovery of the Colombian economy, which had been growing discretely. And we were right. The growth of the economy accelerated significantly from 1.4% in 2017 to 2.6% in 2018. Furthermore, after growing at an average of 2.3% in the previous four quarters, the economy grew 2.8% in the last quarter of last year, the second highest figure in three years. Domestic demand was the main protagonist, growing 4.5% in the same period, the highest figure in four years. In that sense, the figures showed a strong rebound of investment, which is lagrely dependent on the confidence of entrepreneurs, with a growth of 6.7% in the fourth quarter, the highest rate in more than four years. This behavior was partially supported by the dynamics of imports of capital and intermediate goods, which are intimately linked to the behavior of investment beyond construction, and grew at their highest rate in almost seven years. Moreover, in the first quarter of 2019, FDI, according to figures from the central bank, grew by 68%. Investment in construction also rebounded to its highest level in two years, growing 4.2% in the fourth quarter, mainly boosted by the civil works component, which showed its first positive growth in that year. The measures we have adopted to unblock the construction of Fourth Generation (4G) projects, led by the Ministry of Transport, as well as other types of infrastructure works, are also showing their first positive results. In effect, road construction, which is the most important component of civil works, displayed its highest growth since the beginning of 2017 after six consecutive quarters of contraction and practically zero growth in the third quarter of 2018. Investment in housing construction grew 2% in the fourth quarter, the second quarter of positive growth after a year of contractions. To this, we must add the new energy surrounding the housing programs that we launched after just 10 months in government. It is worth noting that the residential building area recorded its highest growth in three years and the first positive growth in seven quarters, indicating a positive trend for housing construction in the coming quarters. All these figures have filled us with optimism and we predict GDP growth of 3.6% for 2019. We have always been aware that the confidence that our economic revitalization plan began to generate required concrete and immediate action. We believe it will begin to bear more fruit as of this year. This is where our Financing Law, which was approved by Congress last December, plays a fundamental role. The Financing Law not only constitutes a fundamental step to improve the fiscal prospects of the country, but also includes several measures that stimulate entrepreneurship, investment, productivity, and the formalization of labor and enterprise in the country through the reduction of the corporate tax burden—the effective tax rate, including mandatory contributions, will fall from around 70 to 50% in 2022. With this, we expect an even greater boost to GDP growth, not only in 2019, but also in the medium and long term. That is, we anticipate that one of the effects will be to raise the potential growth of the economy from current estimated levels of 3.5% to levels above 4%. The Financing Law also points to a more progressive personal taxation regime and incorporates a series of measures to strengthen the Colombian Tax and Customs Organization (DIAN), in addition to fighting against tax evasion, which will also con¬tribute to increased levels of tax collection in the upcoming years. In addition to that, we must take into account that, through the “Simple State, Agile Colombia“ program, we have simplified 615 administrative procedures (374 procedures, 33 barriers, and 208 standards) and our goal is to reach more than 900 by the end of the year. The interventions we have made have generated savings in the country of more than USD20 billion. That sums up the effort that has been made. To all the above, we must add that in the framework of state visits to different countries, I have participated in forums, held meetings with potential investors, and come together with entrepreneurs from all sectors, whereby I have highlighted the benefits that exist in the country because Colombia is a country that is open, in a decisive way, to investment and business development.</p><h4>What is the government's plan to accelerate the techno¬logical progress of the Colombian economy? </h4><p>Technology is about how we improve quality of life by bringing knowledge, goods, and services closer to the hands of citizens. And here you have to be realistic. The country, for years, had been demanding regulatory improvement and we eliminated much red tape, because today's world needs intelligent regulation, deregulation associated with the provision of services, and deregulation that allows us to understand the growing competences between new technologies and not continuing with patterns from the past, when we seemed to want legislation to hinder the arrival of new technological tools. That is why we decided to present to Congress a new Law on Information and Communications Technologies—a law that would allow for regulatory convergence, but that at the same time encourages long-term investment so that we can truly reap the benefits of the digital transformation. Finally, we obtained the necessary support in Congress to make this law a reality. Today, we have a law that provides transparency to those who want to invest in the long term. We have a law that is also clear on the independent development of content and one that wants Colombia to become a country that achieves 5G, starting in 2022, because it is from that arrival of 5G that the maximum potential of the IoT and AI really materializes, along with many other technologies of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Today, we have law that allows citizens to guarantee that we will close the great technological gaps, and that 70% of the country, by 2022, will receive broadband coverage. We will be reaching the most remote places of the country with fixed installations, practically closing that gap of about 500,000 homes and giving the municipalities that are part of the Territorial Approach Development Plan 100% coverage, which also means a great social transformation. We must also refer to elements complementary to the Law on Information and Communications Technologies. This law does not come alone; it is accompanied by measures that are also generating enthusiasm in the investment community, through benefits that exist in tax matters for the creative industries and the instruments of promotion of the orange economy, i.e. the creative and innovative sectors. In terms of fintech, we are ready to move forward. We launched in Medellí­n, at the World Economic Forum, the first center for the Fourth Industrial Revolution in a Spanish-speaking country because we want to discuss topics such as the IoT and AT, and also security technologies and blockchain encryption. Here the role of the Financial Superintendency is essential because we are already realizing that the decision that was adopted to create a regulatory sandbox is increasing the appetite for new operators and new competitors to arrive in the country. It brings us challenges but can also lead us to expand the coverage of financial services through digital platforms and, through this, we can provide room for financial inclusion. Cybersecurity will also be one of the most important tools we will adopt to strengthen financial inclusion in our country and generate confidence on the part of citizens. Likewise, we will hold an auction for the 700Mhz spectrum so that we can also have a presence in the high bands and low bands, and that allows us to guarantee an excellent provision of service. That must also be accompanied by other measures. And the measures have to do with the stimuli that digital entrepreneurship in the country can evolve. And a large part of the stimulus is in regulatory quality. However, our wish is that, by understanding the needs of the labor market and the application of technology in the sector, we will have more programmers and more integrated data analysts. We are short about 150,000 professionals according to big players in the sector. With all the above, I can say today that Colombia has taken a historic step in technological issues. In that sense, technology has to be ready to close gaps. And we are seeing that if we take the technology and training to the most remote parts of the country, we also begin to make great transformations. So, for us, coverage, quality, and closing gaps is a priority.</p><h4>You have repeatedly emphasized the potential of the or¬ange economy. How is the government working to devel¬op the full potential of Colombia's knowledge economy? </h4><p>This government wants Colombia to be a country of entrepreneurs. That is why, in terms of entrepreneurship, we are making a bold and radical commitment to the orange economy; that is, the creative economy, innovation, and the trans¬formation of ideas into goods and services with high added value. We aspire to make creativity and culture the engines of entrepreneurship, economic development, and the generation of new wealth and, therefore, equity and social progress. Globally, the orange economy contributes between 2 and 11% of GDP, depending on the level of development of an economy. For Colombia, according to the methodology of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), it represents 3.4% of GDP (one and a half times that of mining) and 4.5% of employment (greater than that of coffee), and has huge potential to diversify exports and create quality jobs. Therefore, at the beginning of our administration, we launched a series of measures to support creative entrepreneurs as we realized that they face, in their early years, difficulties such as lack of resources and access to credit. Additionally, through legislation, we granted zero income tax for seven years to those entrepreneurs in creative industries with a minimum amount of investment and a minimum number of jobs. We are helping small businesses through the “Simple Regime“ program, whereby, with a single tax ranging from 1.1% of the Industry and Commerce Tax (ICA), to a maximum of 11%, this differentiation is recognized so that there is stronger business formalization throughout the country. We also created a financial instrument called orange bonds, which works like any ordinary bond but its resources are used to finance or refinance, via credit, the activities and projects of companies linked to the orange economy, which belong to any of these three categories: conventional cultural industries, functional creations, new media and software, and arts and heritage. Thanks to these measures, Colombia has roused the interest of large global companies such as Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Apple. Additionally, the Colombian legislature approved a bill to modernize the ICT sector, which seeks to close the digital and connectivity gaps that exist in the country. With all that, we can say that the orange economy has already started and what we want is to multiply its effects in the country. </p><h4>What is your approach to boosting Colombian exports? </h4><p>The commercial policy of Colombia is focused on the use of trade agreements and diversifying exports. In order to identify the agroindustry, manufacturing, and services products that have the greatest potential in international markets, a procedure was designed to identify and prioritize them according to the productive capacities of the regions of the country, as well as the degree of potentiality from international demand, and to subsequently identify, analyze, and lower barriers, especially non-tariff barriers, which have impeded exports. In addition, current export promotion instruments that have shown their effectiveness will be strengthened, among them repowering free trade zones and promoting the use of special import-export systems. Elsewhere, International Distributors (CI) are the right instrument to boost small-scale exports from MSMEs. CIs can gather small producers working in specialized niches and lower export logistics costs. Trade facilitation is another axis for diversification. On August 21, 2018, the Trade Facilitation Thematic Committee was installed, a component of the National Competitiveness, Science, Technology and Innovation System, composed of representatives of the public and private sectors. Within the framework of this committee, regional and sectoral working groups are tasked with identifying the difficulties faced by the private sector in its import and export processes and to generate measures to solve them.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Huawei evolved since entering Spain in 2001 and what is the importance of this market for its global operations?</h4><p>Because of its geographic position and historical socio-economic links, Spain is a perfect gateway for any international company looking to enter Europe or Latin America. Spain is one of the first countries where we started developing our foreign operations, back in 2001. At that time, we had only one country manager, one local sales person, and a secretary. It was challenging work in that the telecommunications industry is highly complex and the density of technical requirements is such that at the beginning we had to solve the issue of how we could gain the trust of operators in the industry. At first it seemed that in order to get a meeting, we needed to spend three weeks explaining ourselves, knocking on the doors of mid- and low-tier managers and engineering chiefs. However, we quickly gained the trust of consumers thanks to our superior technology. Our success in Spain was partially possible due to how open the Spanish market is—Spain depends on free trade, and it is this openness that has allowed it to have such success in Latin America and hold such an important position in global economic development. Medium-sized telecoms operators like Jazztel started in 2004/2005, followed by the big operators like Vodafone and Telefonica. Throughout our time here, our innovative spirit and the quality of our products has consistently won the trust of the industry. This would not have been possible without the openness of the Spanish market and consumers. During this journey, we have treated Spain as a top priority and even built a joint innovation center with the top operators here, always introducing our latest technologies in this market first.</p><h4>What is the strategic plan in terms of expansion in Spain as Huawei looks to maintain this growth?</h4><p>Spain is the perfect place to introduce innovative digital technologies, such as AI, 5G, big data, and cloud services because of the strong long-term relationship we have with the telecoms operators such as Telefonica, Vodafone, and Orange. Thanks to the government, the regulations, and ambition of the leading operators, Spanish digital infrastructure is amongst the best in the world, especially in terms of the fiber backbone. This is highly important because it can provide the opportunity to everyone, not only the rich and middle class, but also those in rural areas, to leverage broadband and gain more opportunities, such as those wrought from e-commerce, online education, and external communications. 5G is a key technology and Spain was quick off the mark, with the government making the decision in 2018 to finalize the first step of the C-band spectrum auction. There are large accounts in Spain, but also a lot of medium-sized, global corporations that are agile, intelligent, and fast-moving and these companies are open to new digital technologies. During this digital transformation, we were able to not only collaborate and introduce our solutions to those companies, but also worked to jointly promote our technology as part of a greater solution.</p><h4>Huawei has faced issues this year in the US market after it was banned by a government national security order, as well as having its products excluded from future Google updates, which will significantly affect its competitiveness. How is Huawei dealing with this crisis?</h4><p>The world is seeing great benefits from the role companies have played in globalization over the past 30 or 40 years. The leading German photography technology player Leica has collaborated with us for the past four years on our flagship P9 phones and this is an example of co-engineering. China has a population of 1.4 billion and most consumers know of Leica, which in the past would have been an impossibility. We also reinvent and co-engineer things to the benefit of more than just ourselves. This recent issue in the US happened because certain parties do not want to collaborate and prefer to go it alone. This is an outdated mentality that does not reflect the current trend of industries and societies. It is a case of moving one step forward and taking two steps back. We believe that the business world should not be disrupted in the name of political point scoring and the recent decision will harm US companies. That said, the move presents no big challenge to us since were ready for such an eventuality.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on the division of your consumer and corporate operations? Which takes priority in Spain?</h4><p>Globally, we have four business groups. One is the carrier network division, which serves the telecoms operators to provide digital infrastructure. The second is the consumer division of smart devices, watches, and wearables. The third is the enterprise division, which provides digital solutions and digital infrastructure to different verticals, such as public administration, transportation, energy, utilities, banking and financing, and manufacturing. The last division is the cloud, through which we provide public and private cloud solutions. We operate that cloud business independently in China and via collaboration with Deutsche Telecom and Orange in Europe. In Spain, we operate all of these business units and they are all priorities in their own right. Our consumer business accounts for almost 50% of our total revenues, but our enterprise and cloud businesses are growing quickly. After so many years of silence and since access to financing has increased, Spain's green energy sector is now exploding. A lot of Spanish EPC companies are working with Huawei to expand their business into Latin America, especially Brazil, Mexico, Central America, and Colombia.</p><h4>What are your key objectives for the company in 2020 and what products are you looking to launch?</h4><p>We have launched Mate20 and P30 and will also launch Mate30 for consumers by the end of this year. Beyond that, we have a lot of other solutions and products that we will enter the market with, for instance ARM-based CPUs, because in our computing service 80% is AX86 based, which is an area dominated by a few companies. We want to help clients reduce cost and power consumption by providing more alternatives, so we aim to enhance ARM-based CPUs after the commercial launch in 2018. More and more innovations will come about and it is important to bear in mind that Huawei has more than 80,000 dedicated engineers for R&amp;D. In 2018, we invested 14% of our total revenue with a value of almost USD15 billion into R&amp;D, which puts us in the top-five companies globally in terms of capital expenditure in this area. This is our commitment to society. Huawei is probably the only company in the world with such a wide portfolio in telecommunications, consumer devices, the cloud, enterprise IT, and AI, which will become a common technology in the future. Simply put; we are ambitious.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is an overview of JCDecaux and how has the company evolved since its inception?</h4><p>JCDecaux is the worldwide leader for outdoor advertising and the preferred partner of municipal authorities. We contribute to the development of cities worldwide by providing state-of-the-art street furniture and services to the public. JCDecaux partners with over 4,000 cities globally, including Paris where the company is headquartered. Our group is a family business that was created in 1964 by Jean-Claude Decaux, with an innovative business model which aimed to offer street furniture that would render a service to the public and cities free of cost, entirely financed through advertising revenues generated from these structures in the scope of long-term partnership agreements. The iconic piece of street furniture that JCDecaux started with was the bus shelter. It was a basic acknowledgement of the citizens' daily requirements and aimed to improve quality of life, facilitate mobility and offer a better experience in the city. This innovation and contribution to urban development has always been at the center of our business model. Our product offering has evolved through time to ensure relevancy to an ever-more connected and mobile audience. While we began with simple bus shelters offering shade and seating, today we accompany cities with smart street furniture that offer contextualized content based on real-time information for greater engagement, charging stations or wifi hotspots to remain connected at all times, or sustainable mobility systems with self-service bicycle schemes, that all contribute to make cities much more livable. In addition to these services, JCDecaux also contributes to a city's beautification with a strong commitment to aesthetics. Street furniture is indeed one of the first things you see whenever you walk the streets of any city, and its plays an integral role in the image of a city. JCDecaux partners with more than 50 international designers and architects (among which Stark, Villemotte, Zaha Hadid) to create iconic structures. In Muscat for instance, where we operate a 20-year street furniture programme with the municipality, we created an exclusive range of furniture that reflects the heritage of the city. More recently, we inaugurated a unique iconic digital structure in the heart of London, designed by Zaha Hadid. More than an advertising operator, we consider ourselves as a long-term partner of cities, contributing to create vibrant urban experiences.</p><h4>How does JCDecaux approach the Abu Dhabi market, and what is your relationship with the Emirate?    </h4><p>Many nations in this region are developing a long-term diversification strategy, leveraging on transportation, connectivity and innovation, making the region and Abu Dhabi more specifically, a territory of opportunities for JCDecaux. We have been committed to Abu Dhabi since 2013 when we were awarded the exclusive advertising concession at Abu Dhabi International Airport. In May 2019, our successful partnership with the airport's authority was further acknowledged as JCDecaux was awarded a similar 10-year concession at the Midfield Terminal, a truly iconic infrastructure where we will be deploying a state-of-the-art digital offering. We are also having interesting discussions with municipal authorities and believe that the government strategy to promote PPPs is a very strong signal which highlights the role and contribution of the private sector to the long-term development of the country. In October 2018, we signed a MoU with the Department of Urban Planning and Municipalities of Abu Dhabi, and hold regular discussions with the newly created Abu Dhabi Investment Office to share best practices to encourage investment in the outdoor media platform and the street furniture platform locally.</p><h4>What strategies does JCDecaux have to hedge against the effects of low oil prices?</h4><p>Advertising budgets are indeed impacted by overall economic conditions and have been extremely challenged in the past few years following the economic crisis. Advertising investments in the UAE decreased by more than 60% according to the latest forecasts from ZenithOptimedia (a media agency monitoring advertising spend globally), as the crisis only intensified the impact of the digital disruption of our industry in recent years. Indeed, advertising spend on digital online media continues to grow exponentially, mainly driven by internet giants Google and Facebook. This accounted for almost one third of global advertising investment worldwide in 2018, to the detriment of “conventional media", including outdoor. However, JCDecaux has been able to deliver consistent growth in the region over the past 5 years, for 3 key reasons: a very selective approach to the market, a premium advertising platform that allows our clients to reach valuable audiences (business decision-makers, high-net-worth individuals, etc.); and continued investments in digital out of home to offer brands the possibility to contextualize communication therefore making it more relevant and engaging to the audience. In a similar way that online media serves targeted content (for instance, an ad at the airport could play in Russian when a flight lands from Moscow and switch to Hindi when a flight from Delhi arrives); finally, we also benefit from being a “glocal" organization, allowing us to extend reach to both regional and global brands.</p><h4>Overall, how would you say JCDecaux differentiates itself?      </h4><p>Through regular contact with authorities worldwide, we have built best practices and defined a strong vision of how we can contribute to renewed urban experiences. This is through our ambitious out of home and digital out of home advertising programs that are based on long-term collaborative partnerships and aim to encourage innovation, entrepreneurship and investment. These are essential in leading the transformation of our business into the digital era.</p><h4>What market trends will have the biggest impact on your industry? </h4><p>In our industry today, digital disruption is having a major impact: as Elie Khoury, CEO of Omnicon Media Group MENA said, “USD1 of advertising investment out of every USD3 in the MENA region ends up in the Silicon Valley", and is not reinvested in the regional economy. We believe there is a major opportunity in this transformation for outdoor media to combine the reach of one of the only remaining mass-media channels available in the public space with precise targeting capabilities. By allowing digitization to engage specific audience profiles we would bring significant growth perspectives. Over the next few years, being able to contextualize content on real-time basis will be a major differentiating point, and this has already proven to be very positive in terms of driving the growth of our media. London recently decided to digitize most of its assets, especially on bus shelters, which has significantly contributed to the growth of outdoor advertising revenues for both digital and conventional formats. To leverage this opportunity, it will be essential to invest massively in the right tools, both on the hardware and software, and define an ambitious data strategy to qualify audiences and make communication much more agile and targeted.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Fast-tracking Innovation]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[soren-nikolajsen-managing-director-alawwal-bank]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your general fintech strategy for Alawwal Bank, should innovation come from within or are you looking to partner with, and absorb new concepts into your bank?</h4><p>Innovation should come from within and from outside. It is very important to create an environment internally where innovation thrives and is encouraged by everyone. It should never be one person or one team's sole responsibility to innovate. It is everyone's 'business,' and good ideas can come from anywhere in the organization. We need to make sure we capture them and are agile enough as a business to bring new ideas to market quickly. Innovation does not start with technology; it starts with people. At the same time, innovation and new technologies are developing so rapidly that it is equally important to keep an eye out for developments around us. Tapping into the expertise of fintechs is a key part of fast-tracking innovation and meeting customer demand.</p><h4>How would you regard Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority's (SAMA) recent involvement to coordinate development in the fintech space?</h4><p>It is very positive that the banking regulator takes a proactive approach to innovation and works alongside banks on this important issue. At Alawwal Bank, we have participated actively in the sandbox initiative and have also worked bilaterally with SAMA. The dialog has been truly helpful in getting services approved that help us serve our customers better. Saudi Arabia has a young, tech-savvy population that demands the very best digital banking services. We are fortunate to have a forward-thinking regulator that is open to exploring new technologies and willing to help banks evolve their services for the digital age.</p><h4>In 2017, Alawwal Bank launched its first digital bank coffee branch in the Kingdom, with online solutions offered in a bricks-and-mortar environment. How do you plan to further incorporate technology in your customer interaction?</h4><p>Our digital branch, which we named IBDA, is a great example of creative internal resources and external expertise coming together. The traditional branch model has not changed much over the decades, though the technology available to us has. We were keen to try something completely new that capitalized on new technologies to serve our customers smarter and faster. By teaming up with a coffee shop and creating a more relaxing environment, it gave us a dual-purpose branch—a place where customers could socialize and do their banking at the same time. We have done away with counters and queues—everything has been designed to provide the best possible customer experience. We have self-service screens throughout the branch, and all our services have been digitized. One can walk in, order a coffee, and walk out with a new account and a working card in under 10 minutes. IBDA opens twice as many new-to-bank customer accounts compared to our best-performing traditional branch. It has also been extremely popular with women and younger customers. IBDA is so unique in its approach and success that University of California, Berkeley contacted us to learn more. It is now using it as a case study in disruptive innovation to teach students globally. The technology that was developed for IBDA is now being rolled out in traditional branches so all our customers can benefit from it. We will continue to look to improve our services by listening to what our customers want. It is hard to say what a bank branch will look like in 10 years' time; however, I am confident it will look much more like IBDA than the traditional bricks-and-mortar model.</p><h4>The merger between Alawwal Bank and HSBC-backed SABB is reaching its final stages. What synergies do you strive for in terms of digitisation, efficiency, and jointly capitalizing on financial technology?</h4><p>The digitalization of our business is extremely important and will be a key deciding factor in why customers will want to bank with us. Whether we are talking about how our customers interact with us, internal efficiency, or our control environment—digital is at the heart of all that. We are operating in a market with a high proportion of young, tech-savvy customers on the retail side and a corporate customer base for whom efficiency and reliability are both important. The merged bank will have the scale and capacity to innovate to help customers benefit from the best of new technologies.</p><h4>What are your strategic priorities and ambitions for the coming year?</h4><p>We have an exciting task ahead of us as we commence on the integration of Alawwal Bank and SABB to create the best bank in the Kingdom. We are already starting to see Vision 2030 taking root and drive social and economic transformation—we have to create a new bank that is in tune with these changes and ready to support them. At the same time, it is important we maintain the same high levels of service our customers rely on day to day and continue to play our role in supporting the Saudi economy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[gustavo-escobar-cio-co-founder-clever-leaves]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did Clever Leaves' operations evolve in 2018, and what have been its main accomplishments?</h4><p>Clever Leaves was formally created in 2016 by a committed team that wanted to create a whole industry for Colombia, and from Colombia to the world based on low-cost, high-quality products. This dream came through the development of careful and detailed strategic planning on various fronts. By the end of 2018, Clever Leaves had five cultivated hectares and a world-class GMP extraction facility. This capacity will increase dramatically in the coming years in order to achieve the goal of 100 cultivated hectares by the end of 2023. This story, however, continues to be written by the Clever Leaves team, our strategic partners in Colombia and abroad, and every patient and doctor that believes medical cannabis is a viable solution to a foremost global problem. In 2018, there were many accomplishments. Regulations are moving rapidly, and there are open opportunities for Colombian firms like Clever Leaves to export. We already have operations and infrastructure in place and have commercial opportunities in international markets. We are becoming one of the largest players in Colombia, much faster than we expected. The industry is seeing more competitors, which is important for quality to be a priority, and many international companies are coming in to compete in the market. The truth is that competition drives us to be better every day. That brings in more aggressive activity, though we have been working with many of the companies to build up the industry to what we all want it to be.</p><h4>What does it mean to be a Colombian company in a market with a great deal of international attention and participation?</h4><p>It means that we have big challenges and great opportunities. That's why in April 2018, Clever Leaves became the first Colombian company to be fully licensed in medical cannabis cultivation and transformation, as well as receiving production quotas for both harvest and fabrication. With this, the company materializes what has been its burning purpose and desire: to bring top-grade medicinal solutions to millions of patients. Our purpose is clear: We strive to offer consumers and clients high value-added products derived from cannabis plants, helping patients in Colombia and around the world enhance their wellbeing. We actively promote shared benefits for all stakeholders along the value chain by abiding by fair business models founded on trust that are strictly within the boundaries of the law. This is a country where one needs to know how to move; regulations are complex. Many believe they can just come here and plant a seed; however, it is not that easy. There might be many investments and projects by companies that have started abroad; however, they have to come here and understand how things work here and how complex the regulatory framework is. They have to partner with the right people and partners to get up to speed and become competitive. They need to have the knowledge to work in the various environments in Colombia that can be extremely difficult.</p><h4>What foreign markets have the greatest opportunity for growth?</h4><p>We have to take into account two main aspects. The first is focusing on psychoactive and non-psychoactive restrictions, while going abroad depends a great deal on the type of product one is producing. We are focusing on combining both. We have thus far been successful in finding the fastest way to access international markets. However, focusing on medical products takes longer: one has to conduct clinical studies and complete more work than just passing regulations. Combining these two aspects, a company can find a way to get access export markets in the fastest time. We have a full combination of doing different things in different timeframes, and by 2019 we should get into some markets. A strong differentiator is having high-quality products, which is what the international market seeks and is something not many companies are capable of offering. GMP-certified products are a significant differentiator. Europe is one of the fastest markets one can enter in terms of the above two aspects and represents a huge initial opportunity for Colombian companies. Canada is another opportunity, and Latin America is the third.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[pnc-menon-founder-chairman-sobha-realty]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will real estate and construction capitalize on the 3.8% growth that the Department of Economic Development forecasted for next year?</h4><p>Post-recession, there have been strong years and not-so-strong years, and this fluctuation has persisted. In a good year, the primary residential real estate market can approach USD60 billion, while in a low year it is around USD30 billion. Within that market, there are a certain number of players. As we work to remain stable, one of our biggest advantages is that we are fully backward integrated. This allows us to have 100% control over every activity that goes on in terms of time and quality. With that, the product we are able to produce is excellent. Sobha has a share within this market. Sobha will be able to continue the business for many years, because Dubai can provide it. A company has to be a successful and honest player, and it must be capable.</p><h4>Is Dubai's real estate market shifting to a new profile of investors or buyers?</h4><p>This is a dynamic situation, and every year will be different. Now, we see population growth of around 5%. There are currently 500,000 homes here, and every year, we must add 25,000 units if we are to accommodate a 5% annual increase, which is close to USD30 billion. When there was 7% growth in 2018, we saw a market size of around USD40 billion.</p><h4>How does Sobha react to volatility in the market?</h4><p>The real estate business around the world is cyclical; however, there is always a minimum requirement. Dubai can accommodate a population of 10-12 million people. Singapore is only 700sqkm and, like Dubai, has no natural resources. Here in Dubai, we have 4,000sqkm. The ability of Dubai to absorb more people is huge. Over a period of time, Dubai will increasingly grow more. In 22 years, assuming a minimum 3.75% growth rate, Dubai will hit 10 million people. I see growth in the future, and in the real estate business, if one sees growth in the next five years, they should be pleased. I will bet on this country for at least the next 30 years.</p><h4>What does Hartland bring to your product portfolio and to Dubai?</h4><p>We are in the heart of the city, and this is one of the few communities that has such a strong location. There are few other projects and communities located in the heart of the city. As a developer, we bring years of experience doing huge and luxurious projects. We are real estate developers that know the business inside and out. We have a responsibility to our consumers to create the best projects we can. We make sure every aspect that goes into the creation of the product is the best it can be. Being backward integrated is unique not only to Dubai but to the entire world. We are the only one here that can boast such integration. The details of our projects are extremely important; we are focused on precision and perfection, and our clients know and appreciate this. At every product level, we have a dedication to quality that translates into persistent luxury. There is great luxury in our dedication to details and in our commitment to quality, and this persists throughout every level of our product offering. We have our own engineering and architectural studio, and this allows us to craft every detail with elegance and precision.</p><h4>What can you tell us about Sobha's focus on innovation?</h4><p>We have a quality department that focuses on bringing the best techniques and practices to our operations. We never rest on our laurels and never will. With every new building and project, we strive to optimize and improve our practices. We are always raising the bar for ourselves, and this is a truly exciting component of being in this industry.</p><h4>What is the purpose behind your new offices in London?</h4><p>It helps us maximize our international branding as well as strengthen our bonds with our customers. Many Chinese travelers frequent London, and they represent one of the largest blocks of buyers for us. The Chinese economy is strong, and this translates into Chinese consumers with a keen interest in international real estate. Dubai is also a welcoming environment, allowing many different people to enjoy themselves and integrate. There is a strong international thread that connects people together.</p><h4>How do transformation and disruption inform your business?</h4><p>Transformation and disruption are all about creating a product for our customers that never compromises on quality. We must always remain at the cutting edge so that we can deliver the very best the market has to offer. And when our customers do not realize the quality of the product we provide, we must educate them. We know what quality and luxury is, and we must educate the market on these issues so they can be informed and so we can drive the market forward. We are in this industry to educate people about how we are changing real estate and offering the finest products.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In May 2019, Cí­rculo de Empresarios asked to reinforce Spain's leading role in the EU to support the development of employment, education, and training policies for technological innovation, and others. In your opinion, what should be the strategy for achieving this?</h4><p>Spain is currently facing a great opportunity to become one of the three major forces of the EU with the expected departure of the UK and the rise of Italy's anti-European movement. Digital transformation must be understood as a much broader concept than merely technological change. It is a way of doing business that involves both technology and internal processes as well as the relationship with customers, employees, suppliers, and regulators. For some companies, digitalization may be the main objective because their survival depends on it; however, for others, it provides new opportunities to consider, a way to reach more customers, create new products, and so on. In any case, it seems clear that digitalization is not an option but a necessity.</p><h4>One of Cí­rculo de Empresarios' projects is that of SMEs, which generate 62.2% of added value and constitute 72.4% of employment in Spain. What are the main objectives of this project, and how will it be carried out?</h4><p>One of the great problems of the Spanish economy is the small size of its companies. The majority are small companies or microenterprises that are difficult to finance, internationalize, and invest in terms of research, development, and innovation. In addition, the retention of talent and the growth of employment is also a challenge. In this sense, Cí­rculo has spent years demanding that the public administration eliminate the fiscal, labor, and bureaucratic barriers that hinder the growth of companies. It also encourages them to lose the fear of growing in terms of contribution and generation of value and employment. Cí­rculo has participated in Cre100do since its inception. This is an initiative shared with the Bankinter Innovation Foundation and ICEX to help medium-sized companies grow bigger. After five years of activity, Cre100do, which has now become a foundation, has been incorporated into 100 companies.</p><h4>One of the most urgent problems facing Spain today is the growth of unemployment. What measures does the Cí­rculo de Empresarios recommend to the government in order to reduce this rate?</h4><p>Spain should set an unemployment target of 5% within a reasonable period of time. Countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, and the UK are below that figure. The rate of 14% for Spain, as predicted by the IMF for 2019 and 2020, is not acceptable. Airef has revealed that we spend EUR6.5 billion on training the unemployed, and this does not seem to produce meaningful results. Fighting the underground economy could help us to significantly lower the percentage of unemployed people. However, above all, we must guide education toward quality employment. We must bring training closer to the demands of reality and the needs of companies. We have to encourage formulas such as Dual Vocational Training, through which apprentices combine theoretical training with practice. We must also facilitate the adaptation of young people to the new digital environment that is increasingly robotized and focused on big data, IoT, AI, cybersecurity, blockchain technology, machine learning, and quantum computing. It makes no sense that there are currently about 135,000 technological jobs that cannot be covered because we cannot find professionals with the right preparation for them.</p><h4>What are the main objectives and priorities of the Cí­rculo de Empresarios for next year?</h4><p>We will continue to insist on the need to address the necessary structural reforms to improve the country's competitiveness and increase quality employment. These reforms are mainly in educational, fiscal, and labor. We must improve productivity and competitiveness and guarantee sustainable, inclusive, and environmentally friendly growth. We must also promote the growth of companies, the fight against fraud and the underground economy, the improvement of institutional quality, and legal security. We also intend to insist on the importance of the European project. From the point of view of democracy, social cohesion, solidarity, and cultural diversity, Europe is one of the best places in the world where citizens can develop their life projects. For Spain, accession to the EU and the euro was an essential element of economic progress. Cí­rculo wants to contribute to the debate for the revitalization of the European project and to reinforce the leading role of Spain within the EU. For all these reasons, we aim to give Cí­rculo a greater international projection. To this end, we have started by remodeling the advisory board, incorporating different experts and prestigious figures from different countries.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[First Hotel Acquired in 1994]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[amancio-lopez-president-founder-grupo-hotusa]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The group was founded 40 years ago. How has it evolved since then?</h4><p>The firm was an initiative that began with limited resources, but considerable enthusiasm to create an organization that would help independent hotels compete with large chains in better and fairer conditions. It was created with under EUR1,000, followed by subsequent cash injection and ultimately, by growth. We were young and learned quickly, creating a group that is diverse and international, and that has a bright future. In our early years, we focused on managing reservations for hotels, and creating commercial networks. Then, in the 1990s, we started to manage hotels ourselves. We acquired our first hotel in 1994 and we have just opened our 200th establishment. Ours is the story of a company in which we learned everything ourselves by doing, and where we were able to deliver steady growth.</p><h4>Was it always a high-end hotel group?</h4><p>No, we started with small hotels and after a time we started to have both high and lower-end establishments. We have a diversified portfolio that today includes boutique hotels, hotels in rural areas, small hotels, and hotels in towers and so on. The key to success is being efficient; once you know to do something better than others it is critical to seize that competitive advantage. Right now, it is vital to be innovative because companies are highly competitive, which is a major challenge.</p><h4>MICE tourism is significant in Spain, ranking second in this sector. What's the group strategy to tackle this?</h4><p>The segment is of vital importance as it is set to grow the most in the near future. There are two strategies that are critical for us: one is the differentiator, such as boutique hotels; the second is specialization in segments like MICE. It has a huge opportunity for sustained growth. For us, this is an important segment and we aim to launch a brand specialized in this area.</p><h4>What makes Spain attractive for this segment?</h4><p>There are several factors, the first being security. Spain has very high security standards. Second is the fact that the public health system is excellent. Third is the existing infrastructure. We have some of the best airports in Europe. And fourth is that we have the second largest railway infrastructure in the world. On top of all that, Spain has a very good lifestyle that is highly attractive. Besides, as a country we boast the second largest number of World Heritage sites.</p><h4>What's your strategy in terms of the creation of Hotusa Ventures?</h4><p>It is essentially a step toward diversifying risk, and to analyze how we move into the future to remain a step ahead. Companies need to be alive, and responsive to global changes. The goal is to create new businesses.</p><h4>You recently launched beds for travel. Why did you enter into this market?</h4><p>We own hotels, and have establishments that we rent, and other hotels that we manage and franchise among other businesses areas. We are active in numerous areas, but had lacked beds specifically focused on the vacation segment, where we perceive growth potential. Launching this will expand what we can offer in our consortium of 3,000 hotels, completing the range of hotel products we offer to holiday establishments. That said, we also plan to boost our franchise business.</p><h4>How can Spain continue to position itself as a world leader in tourism?</h4><p>We are the world's second destination for tourist arrivals. However, the target market is the high-quality tourist who can generate wealth for the country. This industry generates around 12% of national GDP and one out of five jobs created in Spain is in tourism. I believe the country needs to continue to boost this entire industry.</p><h4>What are your views on the Spanish public sector's efforts to boost tourism?</h4><p>Today, the public sector must focus its efforts on attracting tourists from more remote destinations, rather than those close to Spain. We have traditionally received many tourists from France, Italy, and the UK, but right now we have to focus on attracting tourists from the US and Asia, the segments likely to grow the most in the near future. I think more agreements need to be established with airline carriers to boost this tourism drive. We also need to preserve our historic heritage in lesser known destinations and adopt a wider approach to promoting tourism in these regions of Spain.</p><h4>What are the company's goals for the year ahead?</h4><p>We have an area in which we are growing organically at a good pace of 10%. We expect to see continued profitability. We own close to 33% of all our hotels, and operate a franchise business line, a management segment, and a rental business. The model is strongly consolidated, and we are in a process of internationalization. We are present in Europe and Latin America, and intend to continue growing in Africa. I am particularly satisfied with the company in that we employ many young people, which guarantees continued expansion.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Growth Prospects After Expo 2020]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[wadih-hardini-general-manager-chedid-re-dubai]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Since Chedid RE established itself in Dubai, have you seen any evolution in the regulatory framework?</h4><p>The UAE insurance sector has witnessed an impressive growth over the last decade. This growth attracted a lot of investors and many international players opened their appetite to position themselves in Dubai hoping to secure their part of the cake. This has resulted in an increasing level of competition that drove the margins down despite the market growth. This phenomenon is normal for any business cycle, what is also normal is for companies to start thinking about consolidation. It is internationally recognized for a consolidation process to take place incentives should be granted by regulators and we would expect to see an initiative should the regulator feel that the timing is appropriate for consolidation. As far as Chedid Re's activity is concerned, we have gone through a considerable development related to governance and compliance. The insurance authority took the appropriate measures that impacted positively the industry in line with the accepted international practice and standards</p><h4>Is Expo 2020 impacting your operations?</h4><p>Expo 2020 is expected to bring together the best of trade, innovation, and products from all over the world to the UAE. As a result, the growth prospect is enormous. The GDP is expected to grow by minimum 5%. The increase in consumption and tourism is predictable. An estimation of 25 million visits to the event. Thousands of jobs and an approximation of USD82 billion worth of projects in the areas of housing, entertainment and infrastructure by 2020. All the above will have indeed an impact on the whole insurance sector and on Chedid Re and the insurance lines on which we have the expertise and the know how.</p><h4>When motor and health insurance became mandatory, what impact did it have on your company?</h4><p>Since we offer a complete solution to our clients, we have specialized departments within our treaty operation that handles medical and motor business. Using our regional volume and expertise helps us putting treaties for the insurance companies to better position ourselves as pioneer in these lines of business. Therefore, the impact of the motor and health insurance lines was sizable in our books since the mandatory implementation in 2017.</p><h4>What are the best examples that Chedid RE has gone through with insurance companies?</h4><p>The nature of our business depends highly on the quality of the people. As far as Chedid Re is concerned, we believe that the human capital is the value that is rare hence we invest heavily in training and education whether internal or external. So, when we talk about the best example of Chedid Re, we straight think about our values more clearly investing in our education.</p><h4>Are there any sectors that you would like to focus on in the short-term?</h4><p>Having been in the market for the last twenty years, our brand mantra is linked to long term commitment and excellence. Therefore, short terms opportunities are not in line with our corporate strategy.</p><h4>Are developers being conservative in their outlook of the economy?</h4><p>Developers witnessed a crisis that can't be simply overlooked and neglected. It would have an impact on their appetite for the short run. However, the long-term confidence with the market is still there and it is only a matter of period that their activities would resume with the same previous pace assured by the vision of H.H. Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, H.H. Sheikh Mohamad Bin Rashid Al Maktoum and the leaders of the UAE.</p><h4>What does the Dubai office bring to the group, and do you have any expansion plans?</h4><p>You cannot be a part of a serious financial institution in the middle east without having a footprint in Dubai. Being present in Dubai, we are close to the decision making that have impact on the insurance industry across all the region. Dubai became an international hub for the financial institutions not only for regional presence. Because we have expansions plans beyond the region, we strongly believe that Dubai is a gateway passport.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[paul-accornero-chief-commercial-officer-de-longhi-group]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the latest developments of the company?</h4><p>Our focus and expertise is in small domestic appliances. While West Europe will remain an important part of the Group's business, our main growth areas today are outside of West Europe, namely Central &amp; Eastern Europe, and North America. The other area of targeted acceleration for the Group is Asia, particularly Greater China. Following development of the China market, the next likely step for us in Asia will be Southeast Asia in markets like Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines. However, the biggest growth opportunity markets for us globally in the near term are North America, Greater China, Central and East Europe, where there is a great deal of growth taking place and we have aggressive plans in place. West Europe remains very important for us, as it is the largest part of our business today. Coffee is our main growth category, primarily espresso coffee, both with fully automatic coffee machines as well as single serve capsule and manual pump espresso machines. Food preparation remains an important segment for the Group.</p><h4>A few years ago, you acquired a minority stake in Swiss company Eversys. How has this influenced your presence in Europe?</h4><p>We have a minority share in the company, and it is a natural extension of our business because we are a global market leader in espresso coffee for domestic use, and have started to look into the professional coffee category. We have a 40% stake in the company and have an option to increase this to 100% in the future. It was a relatively small company in the super automatic professional coffee category, and is now growing double digits. Eversys is bringing to the market new technology delivering an exceptional in cup coffee result, and modular machines with telemetry control, which is extremely useful in the professional business. Professional coffee makers are a natural extension and diversification of our business. We are focused on home consumption of coffee, however we know that whatever happens outside of homes in the professional world of coffee shops and coffee bars feeds the development and culture of people who are coffee drinkers, impacting home consumption. There are two trends developing in parallel, professional (out-of-home) and domestic (in-home). It makes sense to diversify and take part in the development and growth of the professional business, because it is growing very fast and supports the in-home coffee development; hence, it is a great opportunity for us. Diversification of our coffee offering is essential, both in terms of business development and expertise. We are the only company in the world that has an offer in every segment of the coffee category and are very well placed to continue to capitalize on the long term growth in the category. Our portfolio in the coffee category ranges from basic electric moka and drip coffee makers, to manual espresso machines; and from the capsule systems of either Nespresso or Dolce Gusto, to the premium fully automatic machines and professional space. This has been extremely important in building up our market shares because wherever we are and wherever we go, we have the right commercial proposition for consumers in that specific market.</p><h4>Are you looking at any new acquisitions?</h4><p>Expanding by acquisition is part of the Group's strategy, and we are looking for the right acquisition that can bring synergies and value. We are cash rich and we are in a great position to make the right acquisitions. Eversys is a move in that direction, though it is not meant to be the only one. We are also actively looking for expansion into new categories that are synergistic with what we are already doing. We are actively looking for the right acquisition opportunities in other domestic appliance categories adjacent to our existing core businesses in small domestic appliances that will allow us to accelerate and diversify our growth potential.</p><h4>Are there some markets you are eyeing specifically for this?</h4><p>We are looking globally for different opportunities. It would make sense to have an acquisition in the US or Asia to speed up our market penetration and increase our market shares, but we are active in all regions. We need to find the right acquisition that will bring additional value to the Group and we are ready, willing and able when the right opportunity is presented. Our main purpose is to bring value to our shareholders, so we want to find the right solution and target that will make a real contribution to not only our portfolio but also our global growth in terms of geographies and products.</p><h4>Can you tell us about exploring new opportunities from the partnerships point of view?</h4><p>Our partnership with Nestlé Group, particularly Nespresso and Dolce Gusto, is extremely important to us. It has been strategic and was driven from the beginning by Fabio de' Longhi himself. It has been important for us, not just from a sales point of view but also in terms of ancillary benefits that have come from working with a best-in-class company like Nestlé. The collaboration over more than a decade has been a great mutual relationship. We will likely explore other areas of business, as long as they do not conflict with anything that we are doing today and bring additional value.</p><h4>How has the strong presence in Veneto influenced the company?</h4><p>The company was founded in the 1970s by Giuseppe de' Longhi, and the de' Longhi family is still heavily involved in the management of the company. We are a multinational company and are listed on the Italian stock exchange, and we are also still strongly linked to the Veneto region and territory. We have significant production facilities here as well. We have globalized our business, and I was part of that process when I joined the company 11 years ago. Today we are very much a multinational company with strong business units outside of Italy and Europe, and have a global outlook to our next phase of business development. We are proud of our Italian heritage but do not just want to be a local Italian company. We are a global company, we play on the global stage, and we have global brands. The acquisition of Braun is a clear message in that direction as a well-known global brand. The major drivers for the De'Longhi brand are design and innovation, which are strongly represented in the heritage of the Veneto region and distinctively Italian. This has helped us significantly.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>Our outlook is positive, and we are working on different aspects of our business to make sure we are setting ourselves up for the future. We need to look toward the next decade and beyond. We are currently in a phase of redesigning our business in terms of our customer base and commercial policy. This current period will likely not be a rapid growth phase but is an adjustment phase to ensure we are correctly positioned and prepared for growth acceleration in the future. We are building a solid platform for continued future success. There are years where you have to invest and to adjust strategy to match changing market needs and the future, and this is one of those periods. At the end of the story, we are leaders in businesses that account for 80% of our revenues. We are the global leader in domestic coffee makers. We are global leaders in food preparation (with the exception of the US and China), so we want to retain this leadership and do even better in the decades ahead. We are here for the long term and think about business in terms of long term success and finding sustainable competitive advantages. We are positioning ourselves to have a competitive edge both in terms of our commercial policy and our go-to-market strategy, and our product portfolio. We are ready to invest and have the financial resources to do so. Be it acquisitions or investments, we have the resources to be able to maintain our success into the future, so it is an exciting time.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your expectations for consolidation in the insurance landscape following the new regulations issued by SAMA?</h4><p>We hope to increase the depth of the insurance market in the Saudi economy. Compared to other countries, this sector is currently smaller than it should be. At present, it is just 1.5% of GDP, while the global levels of this sector are much higher. We do not have an exact figure in mind, but we benchmark this with peer countries. Increased activities in the insurance sector will ultimately better serve the Saudi economy. We strive for a broadening of insurance offerings and our regulations are intended for that. Consolidation will also make the insurance industry stronger and ultimately better serve the Saudi economy. Thus far, four companies have approached us for a merger approval. One merger is at an advanced stage, while the others are currently still in the exploratory phase. Although we have issued more stringent regulations for companies operating in the insurance spheres, not all have yet responded to our message of exploring possible mergers to strengthen their financial positions. Therefore, we are now considering raising the capital requirements for individual companies.</p><h4>What is your approach on combating insurance fraud and what role can SAMA play?</h4><p>Insurance fraud is all over the world, as well as in the Saudi Arabian insurance sector. The health and vehicle insurance activities are the most widespread, representing almost 85% of insurance fraud. We work with the insurance companies for the purpose of combating this, hoping that we will strengthen coordination with law enforcement bodies so that we eliminate or mitigate such fraud. It ultimately weakens the sector's competitiveness, reduces sector confidence, and weakens the sector's credibility. That also means higher prices for customers.</p><h4>How many international banks have applied to SAMA to open branches in the Kingdom?</h4><p>We recently issued a license to a British bank. We have also provided our recommendation for another one, also to a foreign bank, as the final approval is issued by the King. We also have two requests for national banks, but these are still in the initial stages.</p><h4>What is the strategy developed by the authority to strengthen or stimulate the auto insurance sector?</h4><p>We are working on a financial sector development program (FSDP) to strengthen the insurance sector by increasing insurance products. Compared to the much higher rates in many other countries, our production and saving programs are still weak. We need to promote awareness and the importance of saving and protection. We want to encourage people to take out insurance on properties, especially.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about SAMA's approach to funding and capacity building, including the launching of a sandbox?</h4><p>The purpose of the sandbox is to strengthen the work on financial technologies, giving all business people, in particularly small businessmen, the chance to enter the financial services arena. We have many participants in this field. But, more importantly, regarding the sandbox, it is a place to learn and exchange experiences for the academic, government, and private sectors, and the business community. Some of them may soon graduate and become entrepreneurs in the financial services industry.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4> Seguros Vivir arrived in Panama from the Dominican Republic. Why did you decide to come to Panama?</h4><p>Grupo Humano is the leader and largest insurance company in the Dominican market. Humano started operations back in 2001 providing exclusively health and life insurance coverage. In 2018 general risk insurance was included in the portfolio. In order to diversify their operations, in 2011 the group decided to enter in the Central American market starting in El Salvador with the brand Aseguradora Vivir. Two years later we started insurance and reinsurance operations in Panama, our country base for VIVIR. Making Panama our headquarters was a strategic decision, considering market attractiveness, growth and stability of the country. Furthermore, Panama has a lot of similarities with the Dominican Republic market, allowing us to benefit from our primary experience and knowledge.</p><h4>What is the relation between the international expansion project and Panama?</h4><p>Panama is a very important market considering its economic growth. We found potential opportunities for developing our business model and offering our varied insurance plans in the market.</p><h4>What steps are you taking to differentiate your products from those in the market? </h4><p>Since our start, we focused our value proposition in service as well as offering a complete health and life portfolio for business and individuals. Panama is a very competitive market, with 23 insurance companies offering all kinds of plans, and these keep us more committed and evolving to achieve our goals. We believe that the key factors are customer service, our relationship with the insurance brokers and innovation.</p><h4>What premium products do you offer to broaden your client portfolio?</h4><p>We have a portfolio of products focused on different segments, with a specific mix designed for both high-income and low-income individuals and for business as well. We have premium packages for managers and executives that cover all services across the world, without the need for reimbursement. We have launched our mobile application to provide a better and more agile service for our customers.</p><h4>What is the company's long-term outlook?</h4><p>We are focused on the corporate segment, as we have experienced major growth over recent years. In fact, we want to grow in the life and corporate segments as well as seeking other opportunities to ensure growth.</p><h4>What are your main targets in Panama?</h4><p>We are working to improve our service platform, upgrading our portfolio with new benefits and coverage, strengthening our commercial structure and focusing on corporate accounts.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Investing in Food Security]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[matthew-jansen-ceo-saudi-agriculture-livestock-investment-company]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>SALIC assumed responsibility for the Kingdom's food security, could you tell us more about that role? </h4><p>SALIC was established with a two-fold mandate. First of all, we work on food security for Saudi Arabia, ensuring that we have strategic investments in agricultural production, livestock and the supply chain towards the Kingdom. Secondly, we strive for returns around 5-6% on these investments for our shareholder. Due to the climate conditions in Saudi Arabia, agriculture and food production can be largely inefficient in terms of energy and water usage, and therefore expensive. Today, the Kingdom imports 80% of its food, and are focused on acquiring assets in this food production value chain to provide food security. To have a have a better understanding of that import quantity, we profiled it and found that about 75% of all imports are made up of 12 commodities or food ingredients. For the coming five years, we have decided to focus on these 12 primary products: wheat, barley, corn, soybean, rice, sugar, edible oil, fodder, red meat, aquaculture, milk products, and poultry. All our investments abroad are within that strategy, and we are interested in acquiring stakes in companies or accessing the volume for the importation into Saudi Arabia. For these twelve earmarked categories, we aim to achieve more than 50% import coverage.</p><h4>What role do you envision for SALIC in bringing investments and interested parties together, with regards to local investment in the sector?</h4><p>Thus far, we have been focused on investments outside of the Kingdom. We have invested in farming operations in Ukraine, we have an investment in grain origination and export out of Canada, and one of our investments is South America's largest beef exporter. We recently acquired Baladije, which was our first venture into Australia where we know own an aggregation of over 200,000 hectares of farming in Western Australia's wheat belt that also carries a 40,000 head Merino sheep flock. SALIC has a broad international perspective in terms of aligning itself with companies that are already doing business today or helping them in terms of growing their business and access into Saudi Arabia. We work closely with Saudi companies and international companies that are already active in the Kingdom.</p><h4>What opportunities do you see for Saudi Arabia to advance in this trajectory to increase agricultural production?</h4><p>Water is a scarce resource in Saudi Arabia, and one thing that has evolved in the past few years is the production of alfalfa. The Kingdom changed the regulations two years ago to reduce the production of alfalfa inside the Kingdom because of an irrigation issue. Now, we expect large amounts of alfalfa to be imported into the Kingdom after previously being grown and distributed locally. We are currently aligned with international companies producing and exporting alfalfa into the Kingdom, and we will have a large presence in that space. If there are other initiatives outside our current scope, we will find a way to assist and encourage that.</p><h4>What is needed to build up the infrastructure around agriculture and livestock activities?</h4><p>The supply chain is this industry is long. We are looking at origination points elsewhere; for example, in the grain sector, we have an originating point in Canada and a large port under construction. The port of Vancouver on the west coast of Canada will be Canada's most advanced and efficient. We have projects inside the Kingdom for import that we are exploring currently. We are looking at every step of the chain, whether it is investments or aligning with companies that are already strong in the space.</p><h4>How do you envision Saudi Arabia continuing to transform the agricultural industry with technology?</h4><p>Technology is a large space, with many different applications, and there are many exciting and challenging opportunities ongoing. We focus on investing in agricultural technology, agro-tech, and food technology. We believe Saudi Arabia can take the lead in the advancement of technology in this space, and SALIC is very much focused on companies that are focused on producing higher yields for agricultural production or improve operations in other ways. We work closely with universities and other advisory institutes to identify the technologies as well as the various applications, while we are also in talks with various agro-tech companies.</p><h4>What is your message to investors outside the Kingdom that are looking to collaborate with SALIC?</h4><p>SALIC is a friendly activist in terms of our approach. We do not have a specific formula; we are focused on what makes the most sense and what is logical. We align ourselves with companies looking for growth, and we can come in with growth capital. Other companies are looking for buyers, and we might look into acquiring the company in 100%. At SALIC, we want to do what makes the most sense, and if we can step in and help a company grow and increase its position in the Gulf, we are interested.</p><h4>What is on the table for the coming one to two years?</h4><p>SALIC is changing rapidly, and we have several projects on the table right now in new geographies as well. As we grow and continue to invest around the world, SALIC has become a more recognizable name with a bigger presence in the food security space. It is seen as a strategic investor with a disciplined approach and focus on providing food security to Saudi Arabia and the Gulf as well as providing returns to its shareholders. SALIC aims to be a world-class food security agribusiness investment company.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Over 25-year partnership with Rolls Royce]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[jorge-unda-ceo-sener-group]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us about the evolution of the company?</h4><p>SENER Group was founded by two brothers in 1956. It started out as a marine design office, as one of the brothers, the late Enrique de Sendagorta, was a naval architect with a PhD in naval engineering. A few years later he asked his younger brother José Manuel, an aerospace engineer with a PhD in aeronautical engineering, if he was interested in pursuing research, and they both worked to develop the company. Opportunities began to arise, one being an international bid for a rocket launch tower north of Sweden in Kiruna in 1967. Later, we expanded into infrastructure, and then energy, naturally became a diversified company. One major milestone was getting a contract in the 1980s from the consortium developing the European fighter aircraft called the Typhoon, for which we helped develop the jet engine. We were awarded the contract to develop 13% of the project. Then, we entered into a partnership with Rolls Royce and developed an industry in Spain for the manufacturing and maintenance of jet engines; a partnership that has lasted for over 25 years. The culture of this company has always been driven by its founders' spirit of innovation and excellence. In fact, one of them, José Manuel de Sendagorta, came from the academic professional development with a focus on research and development. We have always positioned ourselves at the high end of engineering. After starting in engineering services, we moved into products such as mission critical electromechanical systems onboard satellites. To give you an idea, if you look at the Mars Rover, Curiosity, all data that comes to the earth goes through an antenna that was partially developed, manufactured and qualified by SENER: we did the antenna's pointing mechanism. We are proud to remain at the cutting edge of technology.</p><h4>What is the most prominent line of business or products that you offer?</h4><p>Being a diversified company, we have been involved in the design and development of civil infrastructure, transport infrastructure, urban transport, metro systems, trams, high speed rail and so forth, where sometimes we team up with construction companies. That is one business area. Another is marine, where, in addition to developing marine engineering projects, since the late 1960s we have developed FORAN System, a commercial CAD/CAM software to design and build ships. In the energy arena, we have been involved in construction first as a designer, and later on also as a designer, engineer and turnkey constructor of energy power plants. Lately, we have been involved in renewables and solar power plants in which we have developed numerous power plants in Spain, Morocco and South Africa among other markets. Finally we are active in the aerospace business in which we have two key products: the onboard telecommunications systems and the aforementioned mission critical electromechanical systems. They are called mission critical because if that antenna's pointing mechanism on Mars fails so does the entire mission. We also have an investment arm through which we invest in cutting edge technologies that we develop as engineers. Therefore, we have a broad range of engineering services: we design, integrate, test and manufacture aerospace equipment, products and systems; in civil infrastructure, we provide a full range of services for complex integral projects, and we are an international renowned technology company in railways and mass transit; we deliver marine engineering services both designing ships and through our FORAN CAD/CAM system; or we deliver turnkey plants in the energy arena. We are well known for our space projects, but also for our leading-edge technology in solar thermal power plants.  </p><h4>When did your internationalization process begin? </h4><p>It was a conscious move, but expedited by the crisis of 2008 and 2011 when we decided that we had to expand our geographical footprint. The first steps were Portugal, Argentina, and Poland, followed by Mexico and Brazil. Hence, before that crisis I would say that about 30% of our total turnover was international. That shifted dramatically in the crisis years when the process of internationalization sped up. This is not necessarily a good thing because as an engineering company you need the home market where you have established a long-standing relationship with your customers, whom you can rely on to work with you. Today we consider Spain, Portugal, and Mexico our home markets and also trying to develop the same in Brazil.  </p><h4>Are you looking to focus only on these home markets or are there any new international regions or markets to expand into?</h4><p>Geographically we follow different strategies. Where we have a leading-edge product our market is the world, which is the case for FORAN, our CAD/CAM system for ship design, and also solar thermal power plants. For example, with high-speed rail we participate in a consortium with US companies for high speed rail design services between LA and San Francisco. We are also involved in the HS2 project between London and Birmingham, in which we have teamed up with similar companies. As we have the technology our approach is global. When we team up with construction companies we follow them, and accordingly are present also in Australia, Canada, and the US among a few others.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the market specifically in Spain, and what is the role of regulation?</h4><p>One thing that is clear to us is that there is a shift from fossil fuels to renewables driving the energy transition. At the end of the day we will go into more electrified green energy and that will be the future. Out of all the energy consumed, 50% of that is for transportation and that 50% is mainly fossil fuels. The other 50% is electricity generation, and there you have nuclear, hydraulic, wind, photovoltaic and concentrated solar power (CSP). That is going to significantly change because of the drive of the electric vehicle. However, there are still some technological challenges that we have to face, and we have to solve before arriving at the end of the green revolution. How the speed of that will be and how the regulation will help depends on the country and its characteristics. The energy transition has come and it is inevitable, although the speed remains unknown.</p><h4>What do you identify as some of the opportunities or challenges in the near future of the sector, specifically in aerospace?</h4><p>The aeronautics business has an underlining trend of growth because of the increase of travel around the world. However, the aerospace business is rather different as it reaches into realms such as Mars exploration that are driven by the R&amp;D budgets of respective countries. Currently, we are in a moment where there are several proposals for New Space. For example, instead of having a large satellite that connects the US with Europe there are several other concepts being developed now, within this framework of New Space, which is about small constellations of satellites orbiting at a higher speed that could provide quick access to the internet.</p><h4>What is your strategic plan for growth for 2019?</h4><p>I would say investment in research and development, and we currently invest EUR21.2 million annually. We divested ITP two years ago and have the resources to realize M&amp;A's in different companies. A year ago, we realized the M&amp;A of another Spanish company very much complementary to SENER, and look forward to seeing different opportunities in the M&amp;A market regarding various technologies and geographies. Those are the two areas: R&amp;D and the different opportunities that can arise from technologies in new energy, new constellations and then to expand our domestic markets in Spain, Portugal and then Mexico.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does Parsons approach this market differently from other regions?</h4><p>Parsons approaches its work in designing and building infrastructure consistently across its global markets, including the Middle East. The three pillars of our business are people, process, and technology. Those values are core to the Parsons identity. The Middle East region is an exciting place to do business because of the powerful convergence of climate, terrain, environment, and culture that factor into the practical solutions we apply for each project. From an operational standpoint, the Middle East is an extraordinary place to do business because of the speed at which projects move, the passion for new innovations, and the close partnership that exists between our company and the local communities and government. We're proud to support the future of the region's infrastructure and help make it an attractive economic destination.</p><h4>What makes Abu Dhabi a good regional base for infrastructure engineering firms?</h4><p>Parsons has operated in the Gulf region for 60 years, beginning with the oil and gas sector. Much of the infrastructure that you see in Abu Dhabi today was first dreamed by Parsons and our Emirati partners. Forty years ago, Parsons entered the UAE market by undertaking a contract to do the transportation master plan for the City of Abu Dhabi, and that work grew into what is called the Transportation and Roads Improvement Program (TRIP). It has been amended and refined in the decades since, but we continue to steward that project to this day. As Dubai began to develop, we started to engage that market along with some of our competitors, and now we do a significant amount of work there too. Nonetheless, Abu Dhabi has a special place in Parsons' history and remains the site of our regional headquarters. The convenient location allows for connectivity to many other countries, and the emirate easily attracts top talent due to its comfortable lifestyle, high-quality education, access to the seaside, and its rich cultural heritage.</p><h4>Throughout your experience managing the design and engineering of the Midfield Terminal building at Abu Dhabi airport, what unique lessons did you learn that can be applied to other projects?</h4><p>Parsons has been working on the Abu Dhabi International Airport Midfield Terminal project since 2005. Our company has a long history of working on aviation projects, with experience in the design, construction, and operations of nearly 80 percent of the world's airports. Naturally, we brought numerous best practices from those experiences to our work with the Midfield Terminal. Some of these include lessons on the importance of team integration and the unification of systems. When plans are developed in silos, it can adversely affect the success of the project. Managing costs on an airport project also comes down to having good contracts, good risk allocation, and good management provisions and techniques.</p><h4>Abu Dhabi is known globally as an early adopter of smart technology. What are some innovative technologies that Parsons is adopting in its own work here?</h4><p>Our goal is to design smart systems based on interconnected devices that protect connected buildings and its critical assets. Parsons' leadership made the decision to prioritize technology transformation within our entire enterprise. As a result, we were an early provider of infrastructure technology in both Abu Dhabi and Dubai. In Abu Dhabi, smart parking, smart lighting, and autonomous security monitoring are already being implemented, and our plan is to augment those capabilities. Many of our clients are now requesting technology-enabled infrastructure as the foundation upon which to innovate and build.</p><h4>Do you have technologies or business models here that you roll out in other regional markets?</h4><p>In the Middle East there is an appetite for the latest technology. When we engage our clients with new ideas and tools from the US, they are receptive. For example; Dubai's Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) is at the forefront of applying technology throughout their operations. Parsons was heavily involved in the Dubai Metro project, which was one of the first driverless metros in the world. When a client approaches us with a vision for a bridge or rail line, we aim to capture their imagination. Overall, the sector understands the need to build a resilient and comprehensive Information and Communications Technology (ICT) layer in order to accommodate future smart city use-cases, as this will be key to the long-term success of the emirate. This will create further opportunities for us throughout the region as we look ahead.</p><h4>How does Parsons factor cybersecurity into critical infrastructure work?</h4><p>Parsons has a 75-year legacy in the civil and industrial engineering field, coupled with more than 30 years of protecting the most sensitive US government defense and security assets. We are well positioned to tackle the converged cyber and physical security threats currently posed to critical infrastructure anywhere in the world, including the Middle East. Moreover, the UAE has moved comparatively quickly to develop appropriate institutions, agencies, and a robust set of standards in response to these increasingly advanced and persistent cyber-threats. In cases where critical infrastructure owners and operators already have some level of cyber, information security, industrial control systems and (IoT) device security capability—the Parsons' DOMAIN6„¢ Protect Solution augments network segregation and access to critical industrial controls. This will inevitably lead to better protection across their critical assets and heightened defense against cyberattacks. Furthermore, we remain aware of the ever-evolving sophistication of malicious hacking techniques and continue to innovate our cyber technologies to help equip our customers with appropriate, up-to date cyber tools and systems. As these types of projects become more mature, I think it will become a more central part of our business. It makes sense for us to look at protecting the vulnerabilities in that space.</p><h4>How do you expect the Ghadan 21 initiatives to impact your operations in the medium-to-long term?</h4><p>As a provider of innovative infrastructure solutions, we see the Ghadan 21 initiative as an opportunity to grow and boost our business across several sectors in Abu Dhabi — master planning, infrastructure solutions, transportation, mobility, public realm developments, and smart city solutions. Recently the Abu Dhabi government held a charrette on Ghadan 21 and its opportunities, which they referred to as “The Gathering," this was attended by global and regional city planning experts. I believe this growth will occur through our initial involvement in the immediate short-term initiatives in public realm projects, and there will be continued involvement in the long-term plans to support the Government's vision to provide world-class recreational, tourism, and cultural amenities that will encourage the local population to become more active and lead healthier lifestyles, and further attract more visitors to the city through world-class facilities. Urbanization is transforming nations worldwide. The Middle East is one of the most highly urbanizing regions in the world, straining resources and exacerbating environmental concerns.</p><h4>How is Parsons adapting its business model in the region to cope with these issues over the next decade?</h4><p>At Parsons, we've developed a holistic view to addressing the challenges of urbanization through our smart cities, which we view as a smart ecosystem. We keep the end user in mind at the onset, weaving connectivity throughout all our processes, from the master planning stage, to infrastructure and roads design, to the creative design of urban spaces, landscape, and buildings. This approach helps us to create a harmony that we believe enhances quality of life for those living, working and playing within a community. Furthermore, sustainability is one of our core values. We actively work with our clients and local stakeholders to help address their concerns for the region. With the recent drop in oil prices there has been a focus on cost, and we have adapted to this by focusing on value engineering. Interestingly, in this region proximity and walkability are critical factors regarding the supply of sufficient infrastructure and the efficient use of resources. Giving people access to the things they need such as housing, supplies, education, work and recreation is our core consideration. Overall, we have adapted our business model to emphasis a “New Urbanism" approach that has notable benefits for our communities.</p><h4></h4><h4>What has been Parsons experience working on projects in Saudi Arabia?</h4><h4></h4><p>In Saudi Arabia, we are the managing partner of Saudi Arabian Parsons Limited (SAPL). In the early 2000s, with the divesture of our oil and gas unit, we scaled back significantly in Saudi after a long history of major oil and gas projects; however, we continued to serve at Yanbu. Forty years ago, when Saudi Arabia created the Royal Commission for Yanbu, Parsons was contracted there, and we have been there ever since. We have since started to increase our activity with a major stake in a Ministry of Housing project and the Riyadh Metro, of which we are managing two-thirds of those projects. Saudi Arabia is experiencing a boom in infrastructure activity now, and it is a major focus for us.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did Bodyline established its excellent reputation?</h4><p>Bodyline has existed for nine years, with our first outlet in Abuja. Over the years, we recognised a gap in the fitness industry as there was increasing awareness of the need to live a healthy lifestyle. We therefore wanted to create a space where fitness would be a way of life and not just a one off. Based on our experience with the Abuja gym, we created an environment that encapsulates the whole wellbeing of an individual. Our gyms are one-stop shops for one's fitness needs. Besides the gym, all our locations are equipped with high quality SPAs to cater for the relaxation needs of our partners after a strenuous workout. We also run a healthy restaurant in Ikoyi and Abuja to provide the option of a healthy, balanced meal at all times.  Some of our locations host facilities for other sporting activities such as squash, lawn tennis, football, swimming, fitness classes, etcetera. All this has given us the much-required edge to stand out from the crowd. What makes us special is the drive to constantly evolve. For example, we recently opened a 10,000sqm outdoor Xtreme outdoor park in Abuja. This is the first of its kind in the fitness space.</p><h4>What trends are you observing in the fitness space and where do you envision the sector going?</h4><p>Fitness and SPA services have been on the rise consistently, as people are becoming more health-conscious. This can be attested to by the increase in the number of fitness centers and spas over recent years. From our experience, regardless of shocks in the economy, increasing amounts of people visit the gym to de-stress and work out the daily, incessant pressures of the economy. Some of our partners revealed the underlying need for people to take care of their health which they are in control of, rather than fall prey to economic pressures, paying dearly with their health. We expect the fitness industry to continue to grow to accommodate the demand for world class standard fitness centers. We also expect to see new trends, such as more outdoor gyms, sport centers which were once forgotten to be refurbished, creating opportunities for the average individual to maintain a healthy lifestyle.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the most recent developments and upcoming plans for Tala Bay, the flagship project of JPTD?</h4><p>We started the development of Tala Bay in 2002, and by 2005 the beautiful Tala Bay residence was ready to welcome guests and owners. And upon completion of this project in 2016, Tala Bay offers apartments, villas, chalets, and cabanas and is considered to be the only gated community on the Red Sea shores in Aqaba that is fully operating. By 2008, we had the first functioning property, a five-star hotel with the largest private beachfront in Aqaba and 336 rooms. The second property was the four-star Marina Plaza, with 266 rooms. The future plans are to add another 2,000 hotel rooms to Aqaba.</p><h4>Within tourism, what specific sub-segments need to be further developed?</h4><p>We need to evaluate and improve the infrastructure in Aqaba, specifically land transport and public transportation because these are essential factors for tourism and development in Aqaba. Developing the Aqaba center itself and enriching it with other outlets and commercial areas is really important for Aqaba, which is still considered to be small in comparison to other destinations like Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt. Investment in having institutes and universities train people in the tourism sector is essential for Aqaba's development. The potential is huge because there are large tracts of lands that are still empty and need development. For example, we have been approached by a French institute that wants to build a school and train people in Aqaba. Tala Bay owns a large piece of land that we want to utilize in order to best help Aqaba's development. œ–</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Ayla was established in 2003 and has completed Phase I of its pioneering mixed-use development. What are the latest updates regarding Phase II?</h4><p>I have seen the project develop and grow despite the economic challenges. Ayla started construction in end-2008 at the outset of the worst economic downturn in recent history. However, the owner of Ayla and the Saudi group Arab Supply and Trading Corporation (Astra Group) had a long-term vision. Astra Group knew that it is better to plow ahead in difficult times, completing the difficult groundwork and the basic infrastructure. We completed the project infrastructure in 2012 at a cost of around USD400 million. Then, we went ahead with the development of residential, entertainment, and sports facilities, along with our main project, the Hyatt Regency Aqaba Ayla Resort. This is our main hotel, and it is fully operational. Later in 2019, we will open the adjoining commercial and retail area, the Marina Village. We have also completed a second residential project and a few beach clubs. Our total expenditure so far has exceeded USD1 billion. This has been funded by our paid-up capital of around USD600 million and by selling our products, such as homes and offices. Once complete, Ayla will have around 1,500 hotel rooms, 2,000 residential units, and numerous recreation and entertainment facilities. A signature golf course by Greg Norman is in place and has already hosted international tournaments. Notably, lagoons have added 17km of shoreline to Aqaba. The entire project spans over 430ha, including around 75ha of lagoons and 120ha for the golf course. We are perhaps the first project that uses triple play technology to provide full fiber connectivity to every single apartment and shop. Notably, we held a World Cup Wakeboarding event in 2018, and 2019 will be our fourth year in a row hosting the West Asia International Triathlon. In April 2019, we held the world's first golf mixed open with around 170 participants from 26 countries. We have also hosted the annual Adventure and Tourism Conference, where around 150 tour operators discussed promoting adventure tourism activities in Jordan.</p><h4>What is Ayla's role in promoting sustainability?</h4><p>Ayla has been a pioneer in leveraging renewable energy. We have two solar power plants inside the project with a total capacity of 6MW. To maintain a healthy environment, we need to pump around 1 million cbm of water a day, which requires a huge amount of energy that we have been covering 100% from solar energy since 2015. That alone saves us around USD1 million a year. Likewise, our golf course is one of the top-three courses in the world when it comes to sustainability. We utilize solar power for pumping and desalinating water, sub-surface irrigation, and low-water-use plants for the landscaped areas and treated effluent from Aqaba's wastewater treatment company. Reliance on renewable energy is the way forward for the country, Aqaba, and Ayla. We have plans to expand our renewable energy reliance to the maximum, and we will continue to employ water conservation, reuse, and wastewater recycling methods.</p><h4>How does Ayla contribute to Aqaba's economic development?</h4><p>When it started, Ayla Oasis Development Company employed three or four people, and now it's 300 strong, 97% of whom are Jordanians. The hotel itself creates an additional 300 job opportunities, and by the time the project is completed we hope to create 3,000 job opportunities. We concentrate significantly on training and have our own training academy to help students learn about various aspects of business. We are complementing the efforts made by the Aqaba Special Economic Zone Authority and the Jordan Tourism Board by creating assets that accelerate tourism. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the infrastructure within Aqaba Industrial Estate developed over the last year?</h4><p>The site that we presently manage is 1.7 million sqm, with roughly 1.3 million sqm for investors, and the rest for streets and green areas. We should finish the infrastructure in 2019. Infrastructure has progressed on an on-demand basis, and we are approaching our land limits for infrastructure. As for sales, we are looking at a timeline of two to three years. In 2020, we will likely start running out of certain kinds of lots, as we have many different sizes of lots, ranging from 4,000m to 40,000m. Rather than finishing the project, we decided to continue with two additional sites. We have signed a formal contract for one site and have another site as an option to be formally decided upon by end-2019. The piece of land we have signed for is about 1.85 million sqm, and the potential site is another 950,000sqm. One of the sites is in Querah, which is about 25-30km away from Aqaba on the highway to Amman. The other site is about 2km north of the power station and 4km from the new southern port. Regarding the site we have already signed, Aqaba Development Corporation started to put in the infrastructure in early February, and we have started sales already. We have won a provisional contract and have two more in the pipeline. Those three together would probably meet the first year's target goals. In partnership with ASEZA, we also have an MoU with a group of German investors for a large project that will take up one-third of the new area.</p><h4>What sectors and industries are you prioritizing, and from where does that investment demand come?</h4><p>We prioritize what the market wants. Though I was originally against garment industries, we changed our strategy two years ago. Since then, the garment industry has been the fastest-growing segment. Originally, we envisioned hosting metals engineering, plastics converting, power converting logistics, and some food industries but three years ago, we started to move into the low end of the high-tech business, namely hardware, manufacturing, and R&amp;D. Moreover, we have a solar film producer and an extremely advanced LED lighting company. Both firms started up in the last two years.</p><h4>What role does Chinese investment play in Aqaba?</h4><p>We signed an agreement with the Shenzhen Chamber of Investment two and a half years ago to get Chinese companies in the Pearl River Delta area to relocate production, warehousing, and logistics to Aqaba. This was the first goal, and they subsequently became interested in the development of the additional sites. The Shenzhen Chamber of Investment formed an agreement with the Chinese State Rail Road, and we will assist the Chinese State Rail Road in the tender from Aqaba to Ma'an and the mining districts. That project is estimated at USD700 million. Our profitability in the future will depend on these project management activities and partnerships, though it is hard to make money because the government is competing with us.</p><h4>What are your export markets?</h4><p>We set up our first joint marketing company in 2018 with the producer of LED lights and are working with it to develop a market in the region and in North America. I am extremely optimistic about these activities, though they require us to grow our staff.</p><h4>What is your vision for the company and Aqaba moving forward?</h4><p>If we can continue to attract the right people, we can expand and grow further. Aqaba has grown because of HM King Abdullah II, who is extremely supportive. Other stakeholders have not been as supportive because it means diversifying economic development and bringing business outside of Amman. The government has to use its economic power for development, which means it should give more priority to local industries. We have succeeded in convincing the government to give advantages to the industries we bring; however, we are not a macro power. The government has to think carefully about its employment and industrial policies and how they are implemented. The future of Jordan depends on strengthening economic and educational reforms, supporting the private sector, and divesting some of the power from the central government to the provinces. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>With two new desert nature reserves awaiting approval from the government, what is RSCN's vision for creating a curated portfolio of protected areas and enhancing Jordan's ecotourism offering?</h4><p>RSCN is a non-government, non-profit organization. We were established in 1966 and have a unique mandate from the government to establish and manage protected areas or nature reserves on its behalf, which is unique to find an NGO that manages government land. The main mission of RSCN is to establish a national network of protected areas representing different ecosystems and habitats. There is a national plan, and at the end of the whole plan, we want all ecosystems and habitats in Jordan to be represented in protected areas. Thus far, we are four protected areas away from finishing the whole network. We just established two new protected areas, Burqu and Dahek, which will complement our established areas in Shaumari, Azraq, Yarmouk, Ajloun, Dibeen, Mujib, Dana, Fifa, Qatar, and Wadi Rum. Through our approach, we not only conserve protected areas but also create economic opportunities for local communities in and around the protected areas, developing a strong ecotourism program in protected areas. Our protected areas include ecotourism facilities, which received 180,000 visitors in 2018 and include different types of lodging facilities. Via our ecotourism programs within all the protected areas, we strive to achieve three objectives. One is to create economic opportunities for the local community who live around the protected areas. We currently have high unemployment in Jordan, even in Amman and Zarqa, which are main cities and receive more investment. We invested in protected areas, tourism, and handicrafts because we want to create job opportunities for local women and men. Secondly, as the government does not pay for protected areas management, we finance our conservation activities through the income we generate from ecotourism. The third objective is contributing to the national income and changing attitudes to become more positive toward protected areas. We created a brand name called Why Jordan for the products and ecotourism that we developed. One of our most recent tourism developments is our partnership with the UAE to establish the first falcon training reserve and sustainable hunting program. The Burqu Reserve will be the first sustainable falconry program whereby we release some bird species for falconers to practice and train their falcons.</p><h4>Can you tell us about RSCN's role in bringing together various stakeholders in this field?</h4><p>Our strength is to manage sites, though at the same time, we do not want to take on the role of tour operators. Rather, we always work with them to prepare promotion and marketing materials so that they can promote their programs to visit our sites both locally and internationally. There is an annual event called Adventure Next in Aqaba, and we work with tourism associations both nationally or globally to promote and market our sites so that they will be on the plan and map for visitors when they come to Jordan. By doing so, we are diversifying the tourism product and bringing more economic income to the country.</p><h4>What message would you like to convey about RSCN, and what are your upcoming developments for the year ahead?</h4><p>We strive to promote sustainable tourism within the country. Unfortunately, there are some initiatives that are not environmentally or socially sustainable, and we are worried Jordan is expanding in some segments without taking the right measures. Our focus is on expanding our work according to sustainable development programs. We ensure there is a proper environmental protection or biodiversity conservation when developing our tourism product. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the recent main achievements for JTB?</h4><p>From the first day I was appointed Managing Director at the Jordan Tourism Board, I questioned why Jordan does not have the numbers we know it deserves based on what we have to offer. If we compare Jordan to other countries, we have many unique selling points. These USPs include the baptism site of Jesus Christ, the Dead Sea—the largest natural spa in the world and lowest point in earth—Petra, Wadi Rum, and 21,000 other archaeological sites. I conducted a small-scale marketing research study to analyze the behavior of tourists and theorized that the catalyst for tourism is air connectivity. My main priority became bringing in low-cost carriers (LCCs). In 2018, over 500 million passengers used LCCs to travel and a vast majority of Europeans use LCCs. Those carriers did not operate in Jordan. In my meetings with easyJet and Ryanair, they revealed that one of the key obstacles they faced operating in the Kingdom was the departure tax imposed at our airports. We have excellent exposure and have invested a great deal in marketing in the past 15 years and positioned Jordan on many must see and must visit lists. However, at the end of the day, when European tourists see air tickets to Jordan cost EUR800, they will not come. The solution was to convince the Jordanian Ministry of Finance to waive the tax. A simple cost-benefit analysis for a financial model that waives this tax would result in the loss of JOD300,000 (USD423,435) in departure tax income per year compensated by a gain of JOD20 million (USD289 million) in sales tax, income tax, and entrance fees. After I submitted the research, the government waived the tax for LCCs. Then, I requested funding from the government to attract Russian charters. We now have nine flights per week from Russia. Then, I started negotiations with Ryanair and easyJet, and we signed 16 destinations with them, split between Amman and Aqaba. At the same time, we implemented a perception management strategy in the past two years to convince tourists that Jordan is safe. This strategy depends heavily on user-generated content, wherein we invited hundreds of social media influencers from all over the world. </p><h4>What are the next steps to link the growth in tourism with economic opportunities?</h4><p>We have succeeded in our role to create demand, and now we are addressing the lack of certain services that are needed to support tourism, such as transportation. We need more investment in tourism transportation as well as more hotels in Petra and Wadi Rum. We need more nightlife attractions, water parks, and special attractions such as Disneyland. The atmosphere and environment are ripe for investment in Jordan's tourism sector. </p><h4>From where are you seeing investment interest in Jordanian tourism?</h4><p>There is interest from both private and public sectors. The private sector feels it needs to expand more and has started some initiatives, though the one thing I dream of is a big exhibition center in Jordan.  With air connectivity, an attractive climate, and professional tourism operators, we have the right environment to attract large exhibitions in Jordan. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is higher education in Jordan evolving to meet the demands of a knowledge-based economy and further develop its human capital?</h4><p>The Human Resource Development (HRD) Strategy has identified outcomes sought from the national higher education system to draw a roadmap for Jordan's future as a knowledge-based economy, developing human, intellectual, and social capital. The higher education system will improve graduate employment in fields that have been identified as priorities for Jordan's economic growth and acts as a catalyst for entrepreneurship and innovation to foster and develop relevant skills among its graduates. To this end, the ministry has transformed the Scientific Research Fund into the Research and Innovation Fund. Higher education expects to compete with other sectors in supporting GDP, with the aim of contributing no less than 8%. For comparison, manufacturing contributes 17.7%, tourism 14.3%, ICT 14.1%, construction 4.3%, and agriculture 3.8%. This target is attainable through the booming number of universities, now at 32, and the enrollment of 350,000 students. Of the total number of students enrolled in higher education, 42,000 are international students from 105 different nationalities. The ministry, through its unified admission directorate, affords post tawjihi, or post-secondary education, students access to universities. There are different challenges facing HRD's future related to economic and demographic factors. Jordan's population expansion, which is expected to increase by 1.4% per year by 2030, may seem like an economic burden in a country with high unemployment. However, this challenge is juxtaposed by the increasing need for universities and skilled graduates in the labor market. Education can transform these challenges into opportunities. According to the Higher Population Council, this expansion is expected to provide a unique opportunity for Jordan by increasing the number of working individuals over the coming 20 years. According to Jordan 2025, 660,000 new jobs will be needed over the next 10 years.</p><h4>How is the ministry looking to increase international collaboration and outreach efforts?</h4><p>In a competitive world based on international best practices, we have adopted different strategies for internationalization. First, we are directing universities toward collaborative research and innovation, joint academic programs, and entrepreneurship, while encouraging universities to find potential partners that share similar strategic research initiatives. Furthermore, the ministry has networked with many international organizations, such as the British council, Plymouth University, and UK Higher Education Academy, to execute several collaborative projects and courses. For example, the Newton-Khalidi Fund connects new Jordanian academics with their counterparts in the UK, focusing on five priority areas for long-term sustainable development in Jordan: water management, renewable energy, agri-tech and food security, biotechnology and biosecurity, and nanotechnology. Additionally, the Advanced Training Program hosts workshops on various topics for directors of academic development centers in Jordanian universities. </p><h4>With significant support from the UK for education reform following the Jordan: Growth and Opportunity Conference in London, what reforms will the Kingdom prioritize?</h4><p>Following the conference in London, the ministry is working hand in hand with universities to develop strategies needed to flourish internationally in the areas of research, transnational education, student recruitment, and mobility. The ministry is involved in different bilateral agreements aiming at building research teams between scholars in Jordanian higher education institutions and internationally recognized and highly ranked foreign universities. In addition, the ministry has developed regulations encouraging twinning between local and international academic programs and hosting international programs. As for student recruitment and mobility, current and potential bilateral agreements focus clearly on student exchange and mobility. Added to this, we are working hard to reinstate the role of technical education in the future of Jordan. Skilled graduates are a prerequisite for development. Our new regulations encourage students to choose the technical pathway in their university studies. Scholarships and funds are incentives granted to technical specialties students. The higher education council has paved the way for the private sector to establish technical colleges that would infuse technology into education. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been your main achievements over the last year, and where does the company stand after 25 years?</h4><p>The biggest achievement for MedLabs Consultancy Group has been changing the culture of how medical laboratories are structured in Jordan and the region. Up until 1993, laboratories were always a one-man show. A specialist would open a lab and serve doctors and patients, but with limited scope and sustainability. Laboratory medicine encompasses several subspecialties and therefore group practice was needed to best serve physicians and their patients. In 1993, MedLabs was able to create the first group practice in laboratory medicine. MedLabs Consultancy Group began with the merger of four private laboratories headed by five doctors each with a different laboratory medicine subspecialties. Today, 25 years later, MedLabs Consultancy Group has more than 50 laboratories in three countries—Jordan, Palestine, and Northern Iraq and a world standard reference laboratory in Amman. MedLabs employs more than 450 scientists, consultants, and management professionals. It has achieved the highest international accreditations including the College of American Pathologists (CAP) accreditation, which is the gold standard for laboratory quality, the European ISO 15189 Laboratory Accreditation, and the management ISO 2001-2009 certification. Locally, we were honored to be awarded the King Abdullah II Award for Excellence in 2011 and are currently accrediting all our branches with a world-class Jordanian accreditation (HCAC).</p><h4>How does MedLabs Consultancy Group incorporate technological development and innovation into its operations?</h4><p>We work closely with international suppliers, and because of our high number of tests, we can justify introducing the most sophisticated equipment. There are several arms to our business; one is serving doctors and patients through our 50 laboratories and another is our reference lab that performs all the highly specialized tests, such as genetics, neonatal screening, and surgical pathology that serves more than 150 referring laboratories from within the MedLabs group as well as local and regional non-MedLabs laboratories. Regionally, we serve laboratories from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, Qatar, UAE, Palestine, and Sudan. </p><h4>What would be your message to people looking to partner with MedLabs Consultancy Group, and what are the advantages of doing business in Jordan?</h4><p>MedLabs is a highly transparent company with clear goals and a deep sense of responsibility. We believe in excellence in what we do and how we serve our communities. One of the key assets in Jordan is the availability of highly quality personnel in all fields including laboratory medicine. In Jordan, the regulations are clear, there are excellent human resources, there is stability and security in the country, and its geographical location is strategic.</p><h4>What developments can we expect from MedLabs Consultancy Group in the year ahead?</h4><p>Other than the horizontal local and regional expansions mentioned earlier, we also grow vertically. We are regional pioneers in neonatal screening and are currently introducing many advanced tests that have been unavailable in Jordan or the region, mainly in the field of genetics (such as whole genome sequencing). On a human resource development level, I believe that whether you are in Jordan or elsewhere in the world, over the last 20 to 30 years the way the capitalist systems have evolved, humanity has been thrown out the window in the workplace. Therefore, my message is to bring humanity back to the workplace. This is what we have done and are continuing to do in MedLabs. After all, the human element works the machines, applies the systems, and serves the community. If your internal community is not happy, satisfied, motivated, trusted, and empowered, your organization will not be sustainable. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main achievements of the foundation?</h4><p>Our organization is 17 years old with the main purpose of providing the best care for cancer patients across the Arab world. There is no other comprehensive, stand-alone cancer center available for patients in our part of the world providing medical, psychosocial, and financial support. To do so, we went through a scientific, evidence-based process starting from the inception phase, where we learned from international best practices through partnerships with world leaders in cancer and oncology care. This was one of the main pillars of success. The second big success was investing in our human resources, specifically in our consultants, oncologists, and service providers. During the inception phase, we also reversed the brain drain and attracted Jordanian and Arab healthcare providers working in the US and Europe to return and serve the country and patients here. The third important pillar of our success is investing in strong leadership for both the center and the foundation and having an enabling political environment. Along with the chairperson HRH Princess Ghida Talal, the board members are implementing the vision and directing our strategy. The fourth element of success is the humanitarian aspect of our work. From the first day the center was established, it had one mission: to save the lives of cancer patients regardless of their financial situation. We receive all patients living in Jordan, including Jordanians, non-Jordanians, and refugees and other displaced persons. </p><h4>What are your key current partnerships, and what is your strategy to expand partnerships?</h4><p>We have different types of partnerships. We are proud to have international strategic medical partnerships with St. Jude, MD Anderson, and other top-notch centers across the globe. These medical partnerships are truly translated into exchanges of experience at all levels. In terms of fundraising, we work at all levels and locally have partners at the individual and corporate levels. Some corporations support the development of our facilities, while others support our goodwill funds or sponsor our events and campaigns. In Jordan, we have partnerships at all levels, from the community to corporations and government. At the regional level, we have solid partnerships with individuals, organizations, and authorities. Our top supporters are the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait. For example, we received USD25 million from Abu Dhabi Development Fund for equipment and machinery for the new buildings. Another example is a grant of USD50 million from Saudi Development Fund also for the new buildings, machinery, and other infrastructure. We also consider USAID one of our biggest supporters because of its seed donation of USD25 million for our expansion. </p><h4>What other efforts or developments is KHCF working on?</h4><p>We are committed to providing the best care for cancer patients, and we will continue to enhance our capability in terms of infrastructure, equipment, and machinery and invest more in our human resource capabilities. In terms of building capacities, KHCF plays a major role not only for the center but also across the health sector in Jordan and the region. One of our priorities is promoting the training and education center, and part of the agreement with the Iraqi government is for patient referral and exchange of experience, knowledge, and skills that we have built throughout the years. We are building the capacity of its human resources with hands-on training for Iraqi doctors and nurses at the center. Spreading the experience that we have built throughout the years across the region is extremely important. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Specialty Hospital is Jordan's leading private teaching hospital with a number of international awards. Would you elaborate on the hospital's areas of expertise and those where it is pioneering medical care in Jordan?</h4><p>The Specialty Hospital became one of the most awarded and accredited hospitals internationally. Our quality journey started in 1999.  It has been accredited by The Joint Commission International (JCI) since 2008  and accredited four times by the Health Care Accreditation Council (HCAC).  In 2017, we decided to apply for disease-specific accreditation, and we selected cardiac because cardiac diseases are among the major causes of death in Jordan. We are proud of our high success rate in open-heart surgeries for both adults and children. It took us about a year of preparation, and as a result, The Specialty Hospital became the first hospital in Jordan and the seventh in the world to be recognized as a Center of Excellence for two cardiac disease specific accreditations in acute myocardial infraction and in heart failure, giving us more exposure. We have noticed an increase in the number of cardiology patients coming to the hospital both from Jordan and abroad. We established the first cardiac rehabilitation center in Jordan as part of the accreditation. We also introduced the first CT scan, 512 slices, of its kind in Jordan and are likely the second center in the GCC region with the ability to do coronary imaging with one heartbeat. </p><h4>What awards has the hospital received?</h4><p>The Specialty Hospital is the first and only hospital to achieve the King Abdullah II Award for Excellence twice consecutively. In 2012, the hospital was awarded by Arabia500 for being among the top 500 regional companies in terms of growth rate in the past three years. The hospital's commitment to social responsibility to serve the local and the neighboring community was crowned by receiving CSR Arabia Award. In addition to that, we have received the MECCAward, Prince Faisal Award, ISO 9001, Occupational Health and Safety OHSAS 18001, Environmental Safety ISO14001, Hazardous Analysis and Critical Control Points HACCP for food safety, and quality management system for medical laboratories ISO 15189. In addition to all that, the Specialty Hospital was recognized by the Arab Hospitals Federation as The Best Hospital in The Arab World In Patient Centered Care. </p><h4>The Specialty Hospital has been ranked one of the top-10 hospitals for medical tourism for three consecutive years. What is your strategy for maintaining this leading position?</h4><p>The Specialty Hospital is the first and only hospital in Jordan to achieve the Medical Tourism Certification from MTQUA since 2016 and was ranked among the top-10 hospitals in medical tourism worldwide in 2017. In 2018 and in 2019 it was ranked as the third-best hospital worldwide in medical tourism.</p><h4>What specific investments is The Specialty Hospital planning for 2019?</h4><p>We have plans for a big project to build a new hospital and hotel to serve our patients and their families. That will be just across the street from The Specialty Hospital and is going to be a major project. The timeline for that is three to five years. We are currently in the licensing process and preparing the architectural plans. Currently, we are expanding our out-patient facilities. We are always expanding and developing departments and adding new beds. In 1993 we started with 88 beds and at present we have 265. </p><h4>What actions are being taken to sustain Jordan's competitiveness as a medical tourism destination?</h4><p>Another major development by the government is the establishment of a unit for medical tourism in Jordan. I will sit on the Board of Trustees as Chairman of the Private Hospitals Association (PHA), along with other stakeholders and the government. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Already a regional and global leader in medical tourism, how will Jordan's Economic Growth Plan 2018-2022 further improve healthcare quality and medical tourism?</h4><p>Health tourism is considered one of Jordan's most important sources of national income, and Jordan is considered one of top-five most important countries in the world in the field of health tourism, thanks to the Kingdom's wide variety of medical products used in health tourism and healing. Jordan is considered an oasis of safety and stability, making it the preferred destination for tourism, especially health tourism. It is necessary to look for and find investors to participate in this sector, considering the Kingdom's natural resources, such as the Dead Sea and the many natural water springs renowned for their healing capabilities. It is also important to look for new markets that are interested in health and wellness tourism, especially in African countries and former Soviet countries. As for the stakeholders that already work in the sector, they need to work together to create new packages that will improve this sector. We should work on creating an electronic gateway for health tourism under the umbrella of the Ministry of Health.</p><h4>What role can technology and digitalization play in advancing the healthcare sector overall?</h4><p>ICT has a role in supporting healthcare and all the fields related to it, including healthcare services, health monitoring, health literature, health research, and literacy. Linking ICT capabilities with healthcare services helps to increase the accessibility of healthcare services, particularly reproductive health services; reduce the number of premature deaths caused by non-communicable diseases; enhance health monitoring; and increase the safety and quality of healthcare provided. Thus far, the ministry has implemented electronic services in 20 hospitals and 151 health centers. Further efforts include applying data governance and protection policies throughout the digitization of central directorates. The Ministry of Health's digitalization efforts are integrated with other government systems, including for migrants' records.</p><h4>Another priority for the healthcare sector in Jordan is promoting primary healthcare. What is the ministry's strategy to achieve this aim, and how do PPPs play a role in enhancing the healthcare sector?</h4><p>Health education is one of the basic elements of primary healthcare. Promoting healthy lifestyles is one of the ministry's important objectives because of the increasing prevalence of noncommunicable diseases, mostly due to unhealthy habits. One of the ways we work toward this goal of promoting more healthy lifestyles and increasing the quality of healthcare services is through our Community Health Committees (CHCs), which form an important link between the community, primary healthcare centers, and the health directorate. Members of each CHC develop local health promotion plans that are based self-identified community needs and priorities. This active involvement of the communities helps define essential health services delivery.</p><h4>Pharmaceuticals, including pharmaceutical exports, are a key strength in Jordan's health sector and area. How is the Ministry supporting a conducive environment for a thriving pharmaceuticals industry?</h4><p>The Jordan Food and Drug Administration (JFDA), since its creation in 2003, has played a crucial role in the healthcare system. As JFDA is the sole institution overseeing the regulation of pharmaceuticals, it supports, enables, and raises the level of the industry. Collaboration between JFDA and local pharmaceutical sector has allowed us to create compatible regulations and demonstrate a viable model for cooperation.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the status of your Abdali project?</h4><p>Our current progress in Phase I, which is almost complete, demonstrates both our commitment and that of our developers to offer a world-class development. The next phase, which is currently in the final planning stages, includes market research at both the regional and global levels. We will also be revising and adapting our strategy accordingly to the results of that research. Viewed in its entirety, the project presents undeniable synergies that have been harmonized with our stakeholders in mind in an effort to create an integrated Abdali community. As the master developer, Abdali never goes to sleep. In the mornings, the offices are operational, serving corporations and the business sector; our residential sector and our retail outlets and F&amp;B options operate throughout the day serving individuals and everyday visitors; while the entertainment arm kicks into gear in the early evening all the way through the night. All these segments utilize the same infrastructure, which is how we capitalize on integration and synergies, best capturing the philosophy of a mixed-use development. The anchor of the development is The Boulevard, which delivers office space, retail options, and F&amp;B outlets for the entire area. For Abdali, it is important to integrate ourselves into the community, so we focus on corporate social responsibility events that cater to everyone. On an average day, The Boulevard and its surrounding areas have between 23,000 and 28,000 visitors, and we see a major increase in those numbers during major events such as our Christmas celebrations, where the total cumulative number of visitors reached more than 250,000.</p><h4>How do you attract other developers and partnerships?</h4><p>Looking forward to Phase II, we hope to bring new investments and partnerships through a combination of factors. We will organize roadshows and talk to all those who demonstrate a genuine interest in the development on both regional and international levels. We are reaching out to potential developers, creating relationships with them and helping them find areas in which they can invest. We are opening channels with foreign companies who want a base in Jordan and decide to lease a space in Abdali, with the mantra that if they succeed, they will be real economic drivers. By providing them with added value, creating dialogue with them and providing them with the tools that will allow them to remain active, we can move forward with strength and success. Looking forward to 2019 and beyond, we are positive that our role as a catalyst will attract further investment both to the area as well as to the country. Both local and foreign companies come to us because they see the value that we present.</p><h4>What environmentally friendly features does Abdali have?</h4><p>We not only implement environmentally friendly measures because of their impact on the country, but also because of their financial effects, allowing us and our residents to save significant amounts of money in terms of cooling, heating, and lighting. One of the most unique features at Abdali is its centralized district heating and cooling provided by the Jordan District Energy Company, something that is unique to the entire region. The buildings use water collection systems as well as gray water, as Jordan is a water-scarce country, allowing us to play a major role in conserving this fragile and limited resource. Insulation is also sustainable, which means that there is less of an environmental impact as well as much lower future maintenance requirements. Fiber-optic cables are used throughout the development's communication network, and the gas network is uniform throughout the entire development. We have also tax incentives for our investors, both local and international. Furthermore, to help tackle the traffic issues facing Amman, we have created an area where people can live and work in the same place. Abdali has situated itself as the ideal development at a time when the model is changing. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Jordan Economic Growth Plan 2018-2022 outlines double-digit growth for the construction sector. What are the main focus areas and ministry's strategy for attaining this target?</h4><p>The construction, engineering, and housing cluster (CEHC) plays an important role in the economy as an enabler for other sectors in Jordan, such as manufacturing, transport, and finance. CEHC is a substantial contributor to GDP, both directly and indirectly, through enhancing growth rates and providing employment opportunities. In order to raise the bar for CEHC, the ministry's strategy focuses on specific interventions that introduce new international best practices and accreditation systems for engineers and other sector professionals. Also, we aim to revise the contractor classification system in line with new standards of excellence and strengthen monitoring and enforcement capabilities through modification in the newly published National Building Law. The ministry works on other interventions in improving engineers' education and training by introducing new degree programs that meet industry and market needs in partnership with the Ministry of Higher Education, Accreditation Commission, and Jordanian universities. The Ministry of Public Works and Housing (MPWH) focuses on opening new export horizons through better industry organization and promotion efforts to tackle entry barriers into foreign markets and raise the profile of Jordan's CEHC expertise and capabilities. Jordanian contractors should play a major part in the future reconstruction of Iraq and Syria. In this regard, one of the achievements that MPWH supported is the government-backed bank guarantee of JOD100 million (USD141 million) to support contractors in working abroad, which the Central Bank of Jordan announced in February 2019 through Jordan Loan Guarantee Corporation.</p><h4>What role do PPPs play in the construction sector, and what are the ministry's highlighted opportunities for collaboration?</h4><p>HM King Abdullah II, at the London Initiative 2019 Conference in February, mentioned “ready-to-invest opportunities streamed by the Project Pipeline, a Jordan-led effort in partnership with the IFC to develop bankable opportunities with the legal and financial structuring that investors expect.“ In line with HM's vision, MPWH currently is working on the redevelopment of King Hussein Bridge Crossing that connects Jordan to the West Bank, improving the flow of people, goods, and services through new facilities and user-friendly border crossing that is fit-for-purpose and sustainable based on international best practices. The rehabilitation and expansion of the King Hussein Bridge crossing point terminal project will be under a PPP model. </p><h4>How does the ministry support job creation and increased employment in the Kingdom?</h4><p>CEHC employs people across a wide range of professions. To date, around 5,000 Jordanians have been employed in construction projects managed by MPWH. MPWH chairs a higher committee, which also includes the Minister of Labor, Amman Governor, the Jordanian Engineers Association President, and Jordanian Constructions Contractors Association President, for the implementation of the bylaw regarding the mandatory employment of Jordanians from the governorates in which construction projects are carried out. This bylaw applies to all construction projects, both public and private, that are implemented in the Kingdom. MPWH is a partner in implementation of “Employment through Labour Intensive Infrastructure Programme“ funded by the German Federation Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development through the German Development Bank in partnership with International Labour Organization (ILO). In this program, Jordanians and Syrian refugees worked on routine maintenance road projects.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Innovation is a defining part of DHL's history. What innovative solutions are you implementing in Jordan?</h4><p>Through strategic investments, developing our infrastructure, and enhancing our working environment, we have generated sustainable growth and continuous improvement across all functions of the business. As part of our global strategy, our first main focus area is the motivation of our employees. Developing our people and providing the best working environment results in motivated employees which ultimately leads to much higher levels of productivity, therefore ultimately delivering an improved and increased higher quality of service to our customers. It is these market leading high standards that ensure we control increased market share through higher levels of customer loyalty linked directly to our service offering, which therefore results in the longevity of a profitable business. In Jordan, we continue to build on our systems and infrastructure; this enables us to deliver the best possible on-time performance, which is our best sales tool ensuring we are constantly ahead of the competition and consistent benchmark for the industry. Our systems are developed so that our customers can easily integrate their systems with ours to deliver the best possible customer experience, and we continue to invest in our infrastructure, facilities, and fleet within the country.</p><h4>How are you updating your infrastructure? </h4><p>We recently launched a new state-of-the-art facility that is five times bigger than our previous facility. This is to address market demand, and part of the strategy to help grow our customers through the innovative solutions and services we offer. This new facility helps us prepare for future growth forecasts across all aspects of our service and solutions offering to include e-commerce. Additionally, our strategic partnerships with major airlines also help us continuously deliver market-leading services to our customers. As consumer demand in the market diversifies, we also need to be dynamic to accommodate ever-changing customer requirements through the solutions we offer. Having a wide range of innovative transportation offerings across our global DHL network enables us to maintain our position as the most international company in the world, and our extensive global network and the wide range of solutions we offer ensure we continuously meet customers' expectations—it is very much our consistent on-time operational performance and commitment at the highest levels that fuel our growth.</p><h4>What specific sectors or opportunities will drive future demand?</h4><p>The geographical location of Jordan makes it an ideal location to facilitate trade in to the neighboring countries, many of which are now undergoing significant redevelopment following conflict. Countries such as Syria and Iraq rely on us to not only  provide aid during challenging times but also help rebuild many areas within these countries. Customers will now require an integrator who can provide a sophisticated logistics network they can rely on, a network that enables global trade to not only Jordan but the surrounding region as well, and DHL will be in prime position to facilitate this global trade that will help rebuild nations. </p><h4>What can we expect from DHL in 2019?</h4><p>We will not stop investing in our people; this has been and will always be our best tool to support the growth of our business. We will also continue to build on our market leading infrastructure through investment as well as a key focus on developing innovative solutions to help grow our customers—once again enabling them to take their products globally. This will be achieved through a continuous focus on improving our on-time performance to ensure we maintain a market leading position. We operate one DHL network flight landing in Amman on a weekly basis, and we look to increase this frequency, resulting in more volumes. We will continue to offer our customers a range of products that support their growth and success. This means investment in our people, infrastructure, connectivity, and services. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you sum up the major milestones over the past year for AIG?</h4><p>The company was founded in 2007 with the sole purpose of bidding for the Queen Alia International Airport (QAIA) concession. This consortium, consisting of six diverse shareholders, won the bid by a margin of less than 1%, so it was an extremely tight competition. The company undertook the construction of a new terminal at QAIA, and the first phase of the construction was inaugurated in March 2013 and the second in September 2016. Between 2007 and mid-2016, the company invested around USD1 billion in a new terminal structure. The consortium evolved over time, and in 2017 shareholders started thinking about consolidating. Some wanted out, and others wanted to increase their holding. Within the last year, Aeroports de Paris (ADP) acquired 51% in AIG; Meridiam, also from France, acquired 33%; ASMA Capital from Bahrain acquired 12.25%; and local investor Edgo Investment Holdings disposed of half of its shareholding down to 4.75%. This has been the most important milestone because this consolidation means that there is a strong shareholder focus on operations rather than financial engineering and investments. ADP is among the biggest airport operators in the world, and it handles more than 250 million passengers per year globally. Now AIG is a subsidiary of ADP, which marks a new era for the organization. Not only is this a huge milestone for AIG, but also for Jordan. We have both outgoing and incoming investors walking out with smiles on their faces because they feel they have made a great deal. This deal is a major milestone in FDI in Jordan, because when private money comes into the country, it has a different weight. Another achievement is crossing the 8-million passenger mark, which is the result of approximately 7% average annual growth in traffic since the inception of the concession in early 2008. In August 2018 alone, we handled more than 1 million passengers. This is remarkable growth for a country like Jordan, especially when we look at the competitive landscape, which includes Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Doha, and Istanbul. We are surrounded by extremely large players, and yet our growth has not slowed down in our 10 years in the country.</p><h4>How did AIG achieve such major milestones?</h4><p>AIG brings the money, constructs the infrastructure, maintains it, and rents it to users, which includes all the stakeholders. We make sure all the stakeholders are aligned and have common goals. These common goals are hammered in granite into our vision: to always be among the 20-best airports in the world in our peer class, which includes airports that handle between 5 and 15 million passengers. We are working extremely hard to align everyone in this direction so we can maintain our position. In 2016, we were number three in the world, and in 2017, we were second best in the region. We stand a great chance of being the best in the region this year. We are also focused on developing our market and welcome the initiatives from the government with RyanAir. I have always been a strong opponent of high taxes on travel, airlines, and passengers, because they are detrimental to the development of countries. In Jordan, this is a big hurdle. With RyanAir, the government is testing the waters for the model of waiving the JOD20 special tax on each passenger to determine how this could translate into higher GDP and more jobs. The equation could work and needs to be evaluated for the long term. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-right-room-for-growth]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the latest developments in implementing your five-year turnaround plan?</h4><p>We developed a plan driven not by excessive growth, but by sustainable performance in terms of profitability and cash flow. The compounded average growth rate of Royal Jordanian in the next five years will be around 5.5%, which means we will not go for market share. Rather, we seek to have a profitable operation. We implemented this plan in 2H2017, and it yielded immediate positive results, after previously heading down a track of around negative USD60 million for 2017. Finally, we were able to break even in 2017 as a company. It was driven by an enhanced commercial performance, namely more passengers on our aircraft—growing the load factor from 61% to above 70%—in addition to people paying more for tickets. This basic revenue has turned the company around. We continued on this path in 2018 and enhanced our load factor to almost 73%. We have increased the connectivity to and from Amman, the main pillar of our plan. We enable people in the Levant to go to the US or Europe directly through Amman. We have enhanced connectivity in Amman airport in 2018 by 42%, meaning there are 42% more connections from Amman that can be reached in under two hours. In 2018, we improved our operating profit by more than 60%, which was driven by higher unit revenues and lower unit costs. Despite the challenges here, we are performing well, and the short-term outlook is positive. We have added Copenhagen to our list of destinations, among others. We plan to add another destination in the US, though we are waiting to see how the oil market performs. We have a long-haul fleet of new Boeing 787s; however, our other medium-haul fleet is aging, and we want to replace it. We are in talks with all suppliers and will formulate a plan to replace these aircraft by 2Q2019.</p><h4>How does Royal Jordanian position itself in this highly competitive region?</h4><p>Our position is interesting but also fairly simple; we want to be the national carrier for the entire Levant. We cater to all passengers and market segments, such as business, leisure, people visiting friends and family, students, workers, medical, and religious travel. We are enhancing the existing market and creating new markets with new fares that enable people to travel. We are growing the market in Jordan and the wider region. We are continuously going out with extremely attractive fares, and people who were not previously traveling with us started to.</p><h4>As the national carrier, what is Royal Jordanian's role in the national economy?</h4><p>The company is the biggest employer in Jordan, with 4,000 employees as well as 4,000 indirect employees working with our suppliers, creating about 8,000 jobs and accounting for some 3.2% of GDP. The key issue is our value creation; about 90-92% of what we spend is reinvested into the national economy, as we have local staff and suppliers. For other airlines flying to Jordan, more than 90% of their value creation is not in Jordan. This is why national carriers are a driving force for the growth of the economy.</p><h4>How are you investing in your workforce?</h4><p>Our goal is to be the employer of choice, which is an interesting aim because we are overstaffed. In terms of people per aircraft, we employ about 150 people, whereas companies like RyanAir employ 33 people and even Jazeera Airways is below 45. What we can and will do is give younger people opportunities in leadership roles and the chance to grow. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Prime Minister has highlighted the transport sector as one of the key sectors for PPP projects. How is the ministry developing its policies and projects to support this aim?</h4><p>The Jordan Long-Term National Transport Strategy (JNTS) is built on a number of main principles and policy pillars, and one of them is making the most of private participation in the transport sector so the private sector can positively contribute to the future of transport by investing in both infrastructure and operating services. This will be facilitated by setting up an appropriate regulatory environment. The ministry identified the projects that are potentially attractive in terms of revenue returns at the conference in London. One of the highlighted projects was the development of Amman-Marka Airport.</p><h4>What is the ministry's strategy to promote multimodal transport in the Kingdom?</h4><p>JNTS is based on national priorities and presents an integrated approach. To develop multimodal transport and integrate transport with smart land use, the ministry is focusing on reducing transport externalities, including environmental, safety, congestion externalities, and linking trade to international corridor development. This focus falls under another one of the strategy's main policy pillars, which is to pursue a multimodal approach and create excellent interconnections between modes, networks, and transport services. Ultimately, this will increase public transport ridership. Rail linkages are a major component of an efficient multimodal transport system, and one of the JNTS' major projects is the National Railway Project. Moreover, the development of rail networks is being coordinated with logistics developments such as Ma'an dry port project and Madouneh logistics center.</p><h4>How is the ministry capitalizing on normalizing relations with Iraq and Syria to increase transport links with its neighbors?</h4><p>Regarding Iraq, the Jordanian and Iraqi governments are in the process of reviewing economic relations to explore further cooperation and potential areas of mutual benefit. In the transport field, there is an agreement to increase the focus on the Karama-Trebil border crossing in addition to improving air and maritime connectivity. We signed an agreement to regulate and facilitate land transport between the two countries through the Karama-Trebil crossing, and as of February 2019, this crossing allows trucks to pass without unloading cargo, which facilitates customs procedures and reduces the cost of imports and exports. Furthermore, our governments are discussing the establishment of joint industrial zones, launching integrated industries, and joint investment projects between each country's private sectors to encourage Iraqi investments in the Kingdom. The two sides also stressed the importance of moving ahead with the implementation of the oil pipeline project from Iraqi territory to Aqaba, as well as an electric connection between the two countries. Meanwhile, though traditional land trade routes into Syria have been closed, the Nassib-Jaber border crossing was reopened after the completion of logistical preparations in October. This revival of a trade link worth billions of dollars marks a huge step toward reintegrating Syria into the regional economy. To emphasize the significance of this—albeit slow—reopening, maritime shipping between Jordan and Syria takes 40 days. By land, it takes just two. Additionally, transport company JETT re-launched its Amman-Damascus coach service. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some recent achievements of Joramco?</h4><p>When I joined Joramco in 2017, it was holding on to a great deal of untapped potential. As a maintenance provider of airframe services and component services within the industry, Joramco was well known, but it had potential to do so much more. My role as CEO was to come in and tap into that potential and show the industry exactly why Joramco was a significant player. Maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) was typically more focused on the regional and charter business. We are transforming the business and taking it in a different strategic direction. With the support of Dubai Aerospace Enterprise (DAE), we are creating a world-class MRO facility. Step one was transforming the business through a huge expenditure on infrastructure—the hangars, hangar floors, lighting, and capabilities of the facility. Previously, we could only maintain certain types of aircraft, and over the last 18 months or so, we have grown our capabilities to service a different client base. Now we are looking outward toward the industry to promote Joramco and its enhanced capacity. Moreover, the transformation is not only about new facilities and investing in infrastructure, but also about changing mindsets, driving change, guiding coalitions, and getting the staff behind us. This multi-faceted approach is seeing results, and we are expanding our customer portfolio. To date, we have had 12 national flight carriers in the facility, and the business model has shifted from being a regional player into a global player.</p><h4>As you continue to position Joramco as a global leader in the industry, what is your strategy for building partnerships?</h4><p>The client base when I arrived was predominantly from the Gulf, though this has since shifted. Jordan's geographical location cannot be underestimated. The location is superb—three to four hours to the Gulf and Europe, seven hours to India, 10 hours to South Africa. Truly, it is a place where we can do business on a global scale, which is demonstrated by the large number (12) of national flag carriers we maintain. The business has pivoted massively in the last year, from being mainly Gulf-focused to now including Europe and Asia. Europe is an especially interesting opportunity because rates are spiraling, and Europe's cost base needs to be controlled. We have Swiss, Lufthansa, Alitalia, and Brussels all in the facility today, not to mention Gulf Air, Royal Jordanian, and flydubai, among others. Our hangars are full. In fact, we are at the point where if we had more space, we could double the workload today. We are working with one of our key partners, Airport International Group (AIG), to take up more hangar space, even a paid hangar, because there are certain skills here that are exceptional. The Jordanian workforce is extremely hands-on and flexible. My entire 1,030-person workforce is Jordanian. We have an academy down the road, and we internally train 40 students a year, a capacity that could easily jump to 100. That is one of the niche areas not fully developed yet. In Jordan there is high unemployment, especially among the youth, who are all able to work with their hands; however, the missing element is who pays for the training. We are therefore exploring financing mechanisms and seek to work with financial institutions for a solution that fits all. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of your new headquarters in Amman, and what does it say about Jordan's trajectory in the mining sector?</h4><p>We moved to our new, more spacious headquarters to accommodate another company we established that is active in the area of mining and development. The headquarters of ARMICO have been in Amman since 1975, and our first investment was in 1977, in Arab Potash Company. Over the years, we have sought to enhance the mining sector in the Arab world by promoting a number of projects and participating in the operations of more than 22 Arab mining companies. Today, we have seven companies in our investment portfolio. We have learned a great deal over the years, both from our successes and our failures, and we will draw upon such experiences in our future business ventures. Indeed, ARMICO exists to launch new ventures in mining and related industries. As a pan-Arab company established by a number of governments, ARMICO aims to open new frontiers through innovation and does not compete with the private sector. Our mission is to focus on those areas in the mining industry that can potentially lead to added value.</p><h4>How is ARMICO advancing mining and related industries in Jordan?</h4><p>The only way forward for Jordan is to boost industries with notable added value. From potash and phosphate, Jordan can produce high-quality building materials or enter specialty industries like glass crystal and even optical glasses. We have sought to launch a project with great added-value potentials, though unfortunately we have not succeeded so far. Having a strategic international partner always helps. Phosphate used to be a main pillar of the mining industry in Jordan and has many applications Jordan could capitalize on. The margin of profits depends on the pricing of phosphate concentrates, and prices may rise in the future as a result of the emergence of new industries that use the metallic contents of phosphates to manufacture value-added products. Uranium and other rare-earth metals can be extracted from phosphates. Phosphates can be used, not only in their traditional applications such as the manufacturing of fertilizers, but also to extract metals. This is a viable opportunity for the mining industry in Jordan, though there are currently no imminent projects. Added to all mentioned nonmetallic industries, examples of metallic industries include copper, manganese, and other associated elements.</p><h4>People do not think of Jordan as a resource-rich country. How can ARMICO reverse this misconception?</h4><p>First and foremost, we need to spread awareness. Only then will people realize the full potential, and this may even lead to more investments in the country. Admittedly, we do not have gas or petroleum reserves; however, there are many other possibilities, including oil shale. Uranium is a viable resource, and the Jordan Atomic Energy Commission is persevering in this regard. We worked together to establish a company called the University Company of Research and Development, whose aim was to bridge the gap between academia and the industry sector in Jordan. Sometimes people fail to grasp the importance of research, though I try to fight this negative view by valuing research and establishing research centers and labs. Many of our early attempts failed, and it took me years to convince everyone in ARMICO that a research institute would work to the company's advantage. The Arab Mining Industries Development Institute, the first-such research institute in the Arab world, will build a highly qualified workforce and attract international partnerships with other research institutes. This facility here will host a delegation from the Colorado School of Mines. The help of a world-class institute such as the Colorado School of Mines will be essential for us. Whenever we want to focus on a subject, we will find the leading research centers focusing on the issue, invite them over, and cooperate with them. In mining, there are many subareas to study, and it is essential for young people in this line of work to always expand their horizons.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Following the Chinese State Development and Investment Corporation's (SDIC) acquisition of a 28% stake in the company, what is the significance of APC's new strategic partnership?</h4><p>Having SDIC as a strategic partner in APC is of great importance. This can be demonstrated by the fact that APC sales to China, the biggest consumer of potash globally, represented 25% of APC's total sales on average in the past few years. And, with the importance of potash in the Chinese agriculture sector, SDIC's presence on APC's board of directors explains the strategic vision of the new partner for APC's operations to expand the company's production capacity and focus on protecting the continuity of its operations. Having such a partner gives a boost to complete the current expansion projects, proceeding in the expansion projects in APC's five-year future plan, and supporting the efforts of looking for new investment opportunities whether in potash or in other fertilizers products. The Chinese market is considered one of the most important markets for APC due to the large consumption of potash there. APC has always worked on building a strong position in the Chinese market and maintaining a strong relationship with its customers there, as this provides APC with a solid base for its sales plan that would not be affected if markets' demand reduce to a point where they can affect the company's sales volumes and therefore its profitability.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about the company's ongoing efforts to increase capacity and the latest developments from its feasibility studies?</h4><p>APC is currently exploring options to maximize and increase production by reviewing available alternatives plans and the possibility of increasing the efficiency of the existing plants and the evaporation areas. The board of directors has put in place a production expansion plan that entails three aspects. The first includes moving ahead with the expansion project in the northern region within the concession area, which is expected to increase potash production capacity by 140,000 tons per year. Secondly, we are allocating the necessary budget for the technical study of the Lisan area. In this regard, APC is following up with the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources regarding the submission of the tender to the qualified companies that will conduct the study. If the study proves to be technically feasible, APC will compete to obtain the concession of potash extraction in that area according to the prevailing legislation and conditions set by the Jordanian government represented by the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources. Finally, APC's board of directors approved a budget allocation to conduct feasibility and technical studies in Ghor Fifa, located in the southern part of the concession area that is expected to increase production capacity by 450,000 tons.</p><h4>How does APC evaluate its role in Jordan's mining sector and the economy more broadly?</h4><p>The mining industry in Jordan is dominated by the production of phosphate, potash, building and decoration stones, glass sand, and other non-metallic resources. Jordan was ranked the seventh-largest producer of potash in 2018. APC is considered one of the main tributaries of hard currency in Jordan's economy. The company's sales were close to USD1 billion in 2018, including its subsidiaries and affiliates. In addition, APC provided total payments of almost USD100 million to the government of Jordan through incomes taxes, mining fees, road fees, dividend distributions, handling fees, and others. APC and its subsidiaries are the main recruiters in Jordan's mining sector, with 2,116 employees working for the company and its subsidiaries as of end of 2018. In addition, the company has large capital expenditures and civil works being conducted by local Jordanian contractors. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is NEPCO working to diversify its energy sources and reduce energy costs?</h4><p>NEPCO is responsible for the national grid, acting as the transmission system operator and service provider. It is also the single buyer and bulk supplier of electricity in Jordan. Additionally, according to current law, we are committed to maintaining enough available generation capacity to satisfy demand. As for the reciprocal relationship between energy and the economy, while economic growth declines, this adversely impacts demand across Jordan, NEPCO, therefore, has more capacity than necessary. This is one of the challenges we face today, which is why we have plans in place to convert these challenges into opportunities. We are pursuing agreements with neighboring countries that need electricity, for example Iraq and Lebanon. This is one of the many options we are looking at to minimize the cost of our commitment. We also have an oil shale project coming online in 2020 that will help us diversify and localize our energy sources while adding stability to the system in general.</p><h4>How will your loan agreement with EBRD influence NEPCO as well as Jordan's energy sector?</h4><p>We recently signed an agreement with EBRD for a loan of USD265 million. Of that, USD200 million is to refinance our local loans in commercial banks. The remaining USD65 million is for the CAPEX program. This will help us with cash flow and capitalize on the reduced interest rate. One of our strategies is to get long-term loans from international institutions to refinance the commercial loans we have from local banks. This loan from EBRD will help significantly. In the meantime, we are approaching other international banks to get refinancing loans and minimize the cost of the interest rate as well as ease our current cash flow problems.</p><h4>How does this better allow NEPCO to continue revolutionizing renewable energy in Jordan?</h4><p>One of our strategies is to integrate the system to be more flexible and maximize the use of renewables. We have a dispatch control center, which we seek to upgrade or build a new one. This will increase the flexibility and ability to control the grid to accommodate more renewable energy because renewable energy is not a consistent source of electricity. Rather, it needs to be stored and later deployed at peak consumption times. As a result, the more renewable energy integrations, the greater the need to upgrade the control center or build a new one that can handle renewable energy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the most recent updates from the first part of Jordan's nuclear program, the power plant and reactor?</h4><p>We are now pursuing two tracks. One is a large reactor for 1,000MW, which is expected to be operational in 2030 or beyond. Jordan has signed several contracts for energy production, including the supply of gas and renewable energy. As such, excess supply is expected in the coming decade. The National Electric Power Company (NEPCO) will have excess supply, unless it is able to export energy to neighboring countries. NEPCO has also signed contracts with Noble Energy and Egyptian Gas (EGAS) for natural gas and others for solar and wind energy. This is why we are postponing the large reactor until 2030 at the earliest. However, we are now working on a different track, the small modular reactor (SMR), currently in the assessment phase, which is being finalized looking at the design and safety aspects, cost and financing, and strategic partnerships. We expect the small reactors to fill small slots and gaps in energy demand in 2027, with 200-400MW of electricity. We are actively pursuing SMR. However, this all depends on the dynamics of Jordan's energy profile and availability of an export market. The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (MEMR) is evaluating export markets. However, most of our neighbors are energy rich, and our ability to export depends on the geopolitical environment. Much of what we are doing depends on Syria and Lebanon, and we have some years to go before it will become a reality.</p><h4>In gearing up for these developments, how would you characterize human resource availability in Jordan?</h4><p>Our engineering schools are recognized worldwide, this includes our nuclear engineering department at Jordan University of Science and Technology. JAEC was keen on ensuring that qualified engineers and technical staff capable of not only sustaining our peaceful energy program in all its facets, but also to pursue its development are available. Jordan Research and Training Reactor (JRTR), inaugurated in 2016, is one of our different platforms to increase our capabilities and capacities to support peaceful utilization of nuclear energy. In December 2017, we conducted a recommissioning with Jordanian staff following a handover from the South Korean staff. We wanted to be sure our staff was ready and had the confidence to operate the reactors safely and effectively. Currently, we have 120 Jordanian staff comprised of technicians, engineers, and scientists at the PhD level. They manage, maintain, test, and operate the reactor and all its systems. Recently, we started the first use of the reactor to produce radioisotopes for medicine, and we have active participation from the Royal Medical Services and well over 10 centers within Jordan that now rely on JRTR for previously imported isotopes. We have also made the reactor available for training purposes for nuclear engineering students at Jordan University of Science and Technology since April 2018. The program will continue in 2019, and we expect to receive the first group of Emirati students from the nuclear engineering department of Khalifa University in the UAE. It is a multipurpose reactor with a capacity of producing nuclear isotopes for medical, industrial, agricultural, and research in addition to projecting it as a regional hub to train engineers not only from Jordan, but also our neighboring countries. In addition to that, we have sent 150 students on scholarships to France, China, the US, Russia, and South Korea. More than 100 of them returned after their training, while some stayed to continue their master's degrees or doctorates. Around 10 students from JRTR's staff are currently pursuing their doctorates on scholarships from top schools in the US, and they will come back to work in Jordan. We are focusing on this program extensively, since it is an important success tool for its sustainability and key to operating a safe, stable, and secure nuclear program, specifically in Jordan and the region. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the role of JOTC in the restructuring and liberalization of the downstream petroleum sector?</h4><p>Previously, the oil sector was managed and operated by one company through a 50-year concession agreement with the government. The target was to unbundle activities in this sector, namely storage, marketing and distribution, and refining. To achieve this, the government adopted a restructuring program and decided to allow new operators to enter the market by granting licenses to qualified companies for the importation and distribution of fuel products. The government handed out licenses to JoPetrol, Total, and Manaseer in 2013 and plans to award one to two licenses in 2019. Another aspect of the restructuring was refining, wherein the government has a special arrangement with Jordan Petroleum Refining Company (JPRC) to give it some exceptions regarding the conformity of its refined products to the Jordanian standards and specifications, also extending this exemption to help JPRC finalize its fourth expansion project. The aim of this expansion is to produce products according to international and local specifications. The other important part is the logistics, namely establishing JOTC to manage the operating and strategic storage capacities for petroleum products in Jordan.</p><h4>With regard to other infrastructure and business segments, how is JOTC developing its logistics and services capacities?</h4><p>One of our objectives is to develop the infrastructure of the oil sector, which will be done first with the infrastructure that will be transferred from JPRC to JOTC at a fair market value. These assets are a terminal of 220,000 tons in Aqaba and the fuel farms in Jordan's three airports. Once the acquisition of these assets is completed, we will start implementing our plan to renovate these assets to align them with international standards. We have been working on selecting an international operator for a five-year period and will sign an operating and maintenance agreement with an international company to transfer the knowledge and qualify the employees. Moreover, one of our targets is to comply with the HSE regulations across the board. The more important issue is our human resources, so we will develop our human resources, as they are the key to success in our business.</p><h4>What does the diversification of the energy matrix mean for JOTC?</h4><p>Petroleum products and conventional energy will still dominate the sector for several more years. Population, and consequently energy demand, is increasing, and we will still rely on conventional energy to meet this growing demand. Transferring from conventional to unconventional will take time. Petroleum is mainly used for transport, which represents 50% of the demand. We expect a transition from gasoline to electricity, though this will require time. Furthermore, we generate electricity through LNG, a conventional source, so still we are working within conventional energy. We need to be integrated with green energy but cannot completely dismiss hydrocarbons for many reasons. Even in our terminals, we intend to invest in green technology and find smart solutions to merge conventional and non-conventional energy.</p><h4>After the transfer of assets is completed and the operation is defined, what possibilities are you exploring for JOTC's next phase?</h4><p>Potential future investments include another terminal for strategic stock and perhaps a pipeline. If there is no refinery, this means we can build a pipeline from Aqaba to Amman to reduce the cost of transporting imported products that will directly reduce customer prices of petroleum products. Also, we still need to boost capacity of LPG, and this will be one of our main focus areas. Most importantly, we need to be a nucleus to produce qualified employees. It is still early days. There are short- and long-term challenges, and we hope to manage them and build a profitable and successful company. JOTC should be able to inject money into the government treasury and avoid being a dependent body on the government, achieving the goal of establishing JOTC. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us a brief overview of PST's operations and recent achievements?</h4><p>PST aims to enable customers to transform and advance their businesses into the digitalization era. We also want to help them expose their businesses to the world at large by automating their business processes and enhancing capabilities to provide services online. On top of that, we help them adopt what we call “Omnichannels," a solution that allows accessibility for their customers to obtain services and offerings online through mobile, web, kiosks, or even ATMs and wearables. One of the main services we offer our customers and companies is an online payment or e-payments system integration through different channels. We are good at producing and providing services, and our market is everywhere across the globe. We offer services that will optimize the efficiency of organizations and give them the breadth and bandwidth they need for exposure and growth. We have been working with a number of government and private sector clients. We have a landmark project in Jordan, the Government Financial Management Information System (GFMIS). There are around 72 government organizations using the Oracle ERP and Hyperion Systems on a main site and disaster recovery site. In the private sector, we have worked mainly with the banking sector in digitization and business automation, including eFawateerCom for online payments. With banks in the private sector, we have different engagements in the Omnichannel, which is exposure to online banking and mobile banking in addition to business automation and system integration. We are a key enabler of the banking sector's digital transformation by establishing the backbone of the program.</p><h4>What is PST's approach to partnership, and what distinguishes it as a collaborator in such landmark projects?</h4><p>Since establishing PST in 2010, my vision was to have a model similar to companies that are role models in different countries. We are still growing the company, whereby we dream of being an end-to-end provider for our clients where they can get the most advanced technology at a one-stop shop. We strive to be on top of developments in the market and remain business driven. We implement business solutions, similar to Oracle or other ERP systems, all the commodity application, as well as some specific ones such as anti-money laundering and fraud management for the financial sector. We offer these in a secure manner, as cybersecurity is one of the main dimensions of our work. PST has started to leave a footprint in the market in terms of providing such end-to-end support to clients. We partner with the top leading technology providers such as IBM as a value net solution provider partner, as well as Oracle, in addition to having our own products developed in house.</p><h4>How do you assess PST's market positioning in Jordan and in the region?</h4><p>After our 10th year in the market, we are becoming one of the top companies in Jordan in each of the domains we work. We are working to provide services across the Gulf region, specifically targeting Iraq, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, and Qatar, though we still have a great deal to do in terms of learning about advanced technology and new ways of doing business. It is a dynamic industry, and we need to be proactive to keep up with trends. We are proud of our achievements so far, though that does not mean everything was a great success story for us. We expanded to the UAE and northern Iraq and then Baghdad, but we had to downsize our activity after some time due to high costs. At one point in time, Iraq was a great outlet for us to do business, though this has not been the case for the last few years. We hope 2019 will be better, and we have a great deal of work to do to achieve our goals. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us a brief overview of APCO and its project?</h4><p>APCO is constructing the first oil shale mine mouth power plant in Jordan. Located at Attarat um Ghudran, about 110km southeast of Amman, the project will be the first to commercially utilize Jordan's abundant oil shale reserves and will significantly reduce Jordan's reliance on imported oil and gas. With over 30 billion tons of oil shale, Jordan has one of the largest reserves in the world. APCO, the project company, is 45% owned by YTL Power from Malaysia; 45% by Yudean International, a Chinese state-owned company; and 10% by Enefit, an Estonian state-owned energy company. We have been working on this project since 2006. We started drillings to gain a better understanding of the resources and applied for the necessary permits and licenses to start the construction of power plant. After negotiations over tariffs and an EPC contract tender, we signed the final agreements in 2014. We had to take care of financing, as the project requires over USD1.6 billion in debt financing. We attracted Chinese lenders to finance the project, as we are using a Chinese EPC contractor. We also had support from the governments of Jordan, China, Malaysia, and Estonia to put this project together. Finally, we started construction in March 2017, and two units of the power plant will hopefully be ready by end of 2020. The total gross capacity will be 554MW.</p><h4>How did you bring the Chinese investors onboard, and what makes this project strategic for bilateral relations?</h4><p>This is an extremely strategic project for Jordan and is also the first time that an oil shale project has been project financed. In other countries, oil shale projects use corporate financing. We convinced Chinese banks this is a strategic project for Jordan and had to negotiate with the Jordanian government to facilitate the incentives and protection to this investment. Moreover, 95% of Jordan's power generation depends on imported fuels, which is worrisome in a turbulent region. However, Jordan has an abundance of oil shale resources that have yet to be exploited. The Chinese side wanted to support the Chinese contractor and the equity partner within the framework of the One Belt One Road initiative. There were many challenges, as banks tend to scrutinize a project before financing; however, this project received favorable assessments from technical advisors, insurance advisors, and finance advisors.</p><h4>With one of the largest oil shale reserves in the world, what is the potential in this, and what could it mean for Jordan?</h4><p>Oil shale can be used locally in Jordan because, unlike Estonia's, Jordan's is relatively easy to extract and abundant. Once we kickstart this project, the financing of future oil shale projects will be easier. When we wanted to start, there was no proof that we could succeed, and we had to work hard to convince the lenders about the viability of the project. Jordan's shale has unique characteristics, and it had to be analyzed and tested by a boiler manufacturer. Future projects, however, will have precedent.</p><h4>What role do innovative technologies and sustainability play at APCO?</h4><p>We use proven technologies that are previously executed in Estonia, which has worked on oil shale for over 100 years. We have adopted the circulating fluidized bed (CFB) technology, which is suitable for the combustion of low calorific value fuels such as oil shale. Given Jordan's climate and the scarcity of water in this location, we have also minimized the usage of water by implementing air-cooled condensers. Power plants in other regions in Jordan are provided with water and fuel; however, we are in the desert and need to drill our own wells, extract our own oil shale, and develop our own infrastructure. In addition to being mindful of our water consumption and CO2 emission, we also engage the local community actively. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main pillars of the updated National Energy Strategy, and how will it influence Jordan's energy sector?</h4><p>We are currently working with the participation of all stakeholders from both the public and private sectors to prepare Jordan's National Energy Strategy for 2030, with a vision for 2050 in mind. This strategy is built on four main pillars: energy security, increasing energy independence, reducing cost, and diversifying energy resources. When we talk about energy security, it is important to talk about local energy resources. We have been and will continue to work toward increasing locally generated energy. Today, around 10% of electricity in Jordan is generated from renewables, and we expect this figure to double by 2020. To do so, we are reinforcing our grid and developing our Green Corridor project. With the completion of this project, the grid will be able to take 1,200MW of additional renewable energy. We also plan to establish an Eastern Corridor to utilize more renewable energy, particularly solar from the northeast part of Jordan. In addition to grid expansion and reinforcement projects, regional grid connection initiatives are underway with Iraq and Saudi Arabia in order to stabilize the grids and exchange electricity. Another aspect of addressing energy independence and increasing security is energy storage. We have announced a call for proposals for a storage project that already has proposals from 10 reputable companies that we are assessing. Soon, we hope to announce the winning proposal. Beyond electricity, for the past two years, we have been diversifying our gas imports. In mid 2018, we were fully dependent on LNG via the port in Aqaba; today, we have started to diversify our resources with Egyptian gas. On marketing and downstream oil products, Jordan currently has three oil marketing companies—Manaseer, Total, and Jordan Petroleum Products Marketing Company Ltd (JoPetrol)—and we have announced our intention to license two more companies to increase the number of competitors and create greater security for the sector. Another important and strategic project in the oil sector is the Iraqi oil pipeline to export Iraqi crude oil via the Gulf of Aqaba and enhance the security of Jordan's energy supply. The agreement will give Jordan priority to get 150,000bpd, while the pipeline capacity will be 1 million bpd.</p><h4>How are the oil and gas exploration activities progressing in the Kingdom?</h4><p>Within oil and gas exploration, we are intensifying our efforts in three main areas. The first is to upgrade and develop Risha Gas Field to improve gas production. Today, we are producing around 10 million cubic feet (mcf) of gas per day with hopes to double that by YE2019, which is still not that much if we compare it to Jordan's current consumption of over 330mcf of gas per day. The second is oil and gas explorations, where we have identified six areas where we believe there could be oil—Jafr, the North Highlands, West Safawi, Rum, Petra, and the Dead Sea. We have announced these areas as open exploration blocks, and two of them have been taken by one of the companies for further studies. The third area is oil shale. We have four oil companies working in Jordan, including Shell, which is experimenting its unique in situ conversion process. There are three other companies working in surface retort exploration.<br>In addition to licensing two additional oil marketing companies, what else is happening in Jordan's downstream oil industry?<br>When we talk about downstream, it is important to mention the Jordan Petroleum Refinery Company (JPRC). It is operating on a commercial basis and is looking at its fourth expansion, for which it seeks to raise funds. This expansion will allow the refinery to improve its products, most of which go to the local market. Moreover, the refinery has started to export some of its products, so the upgrade and expansion is also important for Jordan. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did you decide to establish Classic Fashion in Jordan?</h4><p>A chartered accountant by training, I have been in the apparel manufacturing industry since 1991. After having held leadership positions with other apparel making conglomerates in the Middle East, I decided to set up my own company. Jordan was and remains a natural choice—I have such high regard and appreciation for this wonderful nation. With the USD500,000 that I had saved up to that point, I established Classic Fashion, albeit in a small way, with a workforce of 300 and an annual turnover of USD2 million. My relationship with customers (the brands and retailers that buy our garments), machinery suppliers, and raw material suppliers worked well. They had found a reliable partner in me and thus began a wonderful association that remains intact even to this day. My clients have stood with me through thick and thin, and I have strived to retain my position as a strategic vendor to them. And here we are today in 2019, providing employment opportunities for over 24,000 people, a half-billion-dollar business, and leading various industry-initiatives crucial for the growth of the entire apparel industry in Jordan. Classic Fashion has been reinvesting its profits into the business, mainly on infrastructure, new machinery, high-class accommodations for our migrant employees, skill development programs for our employees, and large warehouses, all of which are essential for sustained growth of the business.    </p><h4>How has the satellite model pioneered in conjunction with the Kingdom helped your growth?</h4><p>Satellite factories are established in rural pockets mainly to create employment opportunities for Jordanian youth. We were amongst the first to set up such a unit in 2013. Today, we have six operational units under this scheme and a seventh coming online later in 2019. It is actually a quid-pro-quo arrangement; we create job opportunities for Jordanian youth, and government facilitates our access to a highly-skilled migrant workforce in our main factories. We have provided skills development training and employment to at least 3,500 Jordanians from the local community in the remotest areas. We at Classic Fashion understand that satellite factories will play a key role in the future of the apparel industry, which is why we are putting in a lot of efforts and resources to get them up to speed. And this is no easy process: it takes us at least three-four years to even achieve breakeven at these factories.  </p><h4>What more needs to be done to progress this industry further?</h4><p>The apparel industry in Jordan could well be scaled up to a USD10-billion business, employing 200,000-300,000 Jordanian youth in the next few years, provided there are concerted efforts at the macro level to create a strategic vision for the industry with short, medium, and long-term goals. This entails pursuing policies that encourage investors to increase funding into the industry and tax structures that incentivize skill development and job creation to help our industries remain competitive despite the rising cost of raw materials and labor. It also means insulating the apparel industry from unplanned statutory burdens and establishing a fashion design school where Jordanian youth can learn the trade. We have a very clear vision to be a USD1-billion company by 2024, and we are working on raising funds to support our infrastructure. To achieve that target, we have set up our own textile mill in Jordan that will use hi-tech machinery to produce fabric in an eco-friendly and sustainable manner. </p>]]></richbody0content>

In early December, the Prime Minister held the groundbreaking ceremony for the satellite factory in Sahab. We expect to start the operation in August, with the first phase employing about 500 local workers and the second employing another 500. We expect this to resolve some of the unemployment issues in that area, and this satellite model is fully supported by the local government with the building of the factory and assisting with part of the salary for a certain period during initial operations. We have been in Jordan for over 17 years and are extremely honored to be the first Jordanian company to be listed on NASDAQ. We are in a unique position to create positive returns for Jordanian society. Reducing employment in remote areas is one of the best initiatives in this regard.</p><h4>What have been the effects of Jerash's NASDAQ listing?</h4><p>After several years in Jordan, everyone here is familiar with Jerash's quality and workmanship in garment manufacturing. After listing on the NASDAQ in May 2018, Jerash became an internationally recognized company. With shares floating on NSDAQ, it is easier for international brands to gain access to Jerash. For Jordan, this is also extremely significant because we are the first Jordanian company to be listed here. Both the Minister of Industry, Trade, and Supply and the Minister of State for Investment Affairs, who were present at the bell-ringing ceremony, said Jerash has set an excellent example for other Jordanian companies to follow. Jerash is a model of how other businesses can access more capital to expand through international capital platforms.</p><h4>What makes Jerash Holdings the preferred partner in this industry?</h4><p>For our business, we need to focus on three main pillars: quality workmanship, prompt delivery, and strict compliance with international standards in terms of working environment, living conditions, and human rights. Because of that, we receive great support from our buyers who are reputable names in the industry and continue to place increasingly large orders with us every year. We need to be diversified, especially in our product range, so that we can meet our customers' demands. For the last few years, Jerash has been expanding fairly rapidly, largely through growing commitments from our buyers.</p><h4>What trends do you see in customer demand?</h4><p>Jordan has enjoyed free trade agreements since 2000, and we have enjoyed access to the US market where we have savings on specific items of more than 30%, which are reflected in prices. In 2018 alone, VF (the North Face) had significant duty savings by placing orders in Jordan. In 2018, we were the first Jordanian company entitled to duty-free sales in Europe because we employ Syrian refugees. Europe has huge potential, and increasing numbers of European buyers are knocking on our doors for more orders. Jordan's geographic proximity to Europe means the lead time is shorter, which also gives us a competitive advantage. After over 17 years of operation in the country, we have the full support of the government in every area, such as the import of labor and tax-free conditions for a certain duration. The friendly attitude of the government is one of the reasons behind our positive track record in exporting to the US and European markets. Overall, Jordan has many advantages as a manufacturing and industrial hub, including investment incentives, development and free zones, excellent education, macroeconomic stability, modern infrastructure, security, and market access to over 1 billion consumers. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As an IT solutions company, how does ITG leverage its expertise across numerous sectors?</h4><p>We are a company with our own products and a business development team that is proactive in securing deals to help and best serve organizations. Our latest product is a medical tourism platform that connects providers from the medical sector with patients who are interested in coming to Jordan for certain treatments. We are not doctors or medical experts; rather, we leverage our know-how as an IT company to create a link between stakeholders. It is a marketplace where we connect businesses to businesses, businesses to patients, and doctors to governments, as Jordan is known to be number one in the region for medical tourism. We help the government retain that position via the use of technology. In the education field, we are expanding into Asia now. We are an international company operating in multiple regions and countries through five branches, in Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the US, and Africa. Through those branches, we reach out to clients and governments that need help in their attempts to reform their education system through technology. We facilitate the work of educators and the ministries of education to perform better and cope with 21st-century requirements. Asia is extremely important to us, which is why we are expanding there, as we should have been there earlier. There remains a challenge with bandwidth, so there is a balance between what we do, where we do it, and when we can do it; however, 2019 is the time to expand into Asia.</p><h4>What are the next steps and the projected timeline for this expansion into Asia?</h4><p>We are already in the Philippines and India and are in close discussions with multiple other governments, including China. We have started with those steps and hope those small steps will grow to become bigger steps into those countries and regions. With our presence in Africa, coupled with our nascent presence in Asia, we will be able to expand faster than usual organic growth into those markets.</p><h4>What are Jordan's strengths as an IT hub?</h4><p>We started from Jordan and are extremely proud to be Jordanian. Our biggest presence and headcount is still in Jordan. The local sector is extremely well structured; there are challenges, though they are minor compared to other locations. Investments today do not recognize geography and have opportunities to relocate if they are not comfortable in the environment they are in. Therefore, ITG's continued strong presence in Jordan is a testimony of what the country provides in terms of the environment and foreign direct investment laws. These environment and investment laws, combined with human capital and market access, create an excellent package. Jordan's package is extremely tempting in the services and IT sectors; no country worldwide can compete with what Jordan offers.</p><h4>The government is focused on addressing a labor supply gap in the sector. What role does ITG play in building up the human capital in Jordan?</h4><p>I do not agree with the ministry's assessment of a labor shortage or gap in skill sets in the IT sector. The issue is not in the human capital but rather in the vision. His Excellency wants to consider Jordan as a hub for business process outsourcing (BPO), which requires a larger scale of affordable human capital that Jordan does not have. Instead, Jordan has extremely talented human capital, which may not be as large as any other location focusing on BPO such as India, Egypt, or the Philippines, though it is a unique human capital with an entrepreneurial spirit. Such talent is precisely why Jordan leads in the entrepreneurship space throughout the region, why most of the IPs from the region come out of Jordan, and why Jordan human capital was able to help build all other ICT sectors in the region around us. Jordan is a small country and should focus on its niche offering. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Since launching in 2005, Umniah has stood out as the fastest-growing communications services provider. What have been some main recent achievements?</h4><p>Our most important achievement for 2018 was our deal with Jordan Electric Power Company (JEPCO) for a fiber-optic network. This is the most innovative deal in terms of how it services consumers, the business community, and the overall country. It is a significant infrastructure investment to form a joint venture company; we will build the infrastructure to reach 1.4 million households in Amman and the surrounding big cities of Zarqa, Madaba, and Salt. Within three years, we can offer ultra-high-speed broadband to 70% of households in Jordan with this infrastructure company. In comparison to many European countries, we will be ahead in terms of infrastructure availability for households. The company will utilize existing assets to serve the overall economic development of the country. Another important element of this project is that it is a wholesale company, serving all operators and new start-ups on an equal basis. This opens business opportunities to existing companies so there is no double investment, as there is a common platform open for everyone to use, not to mention it will also provide employment opportunities. There is no competitive edge in this sense for any one company. Third, this addresses a need for the internet required by most Jordanian households. We are now the third utility provider, in addition to water and electricity, enabling an infrastructure that allows every household internet access. This will be one of the most important utility services in the coming years. We are changing the shape of the country with this investment, pushing the economy, and creating more opportunities for more companies to work with. It will begin to materialize in 2019, and we have a three-year deadline to complete the project. At this point, the agreement is with Jordan Electricity Distribution Company, with services and assets serving the aforementioned 1.4 million households. There are two other companies serving the north and another serving the south. This initiative could, therefore, be the step for Umniah to make partnerships with other electricity distribution companies in different parts of Jordan.</p><h4>What is the company's marketing position, and what steps is it taking to enhance this position?</h4><p>Our strategy is always centered on what the consumer needs and how to make that happen in the best way. We try to anticipate customer trends and reach them in the most economic ways. We are an efficient machine geared toward efficient production of value and services. These are typically the best service with high speeds, high volumes, and transparency, using innovation to produce this for our consumers. In addition to fiber optics, we have all the standard products and services—broadband and wireless, mobile 4G services, and every standard telecom service. However, it is all about how those are packaged and produced at an affordable price for the consumer. We are achieving this by transforming ourselves from a traditional telecom provider into a digital services provider. The telecom industry is one of the laziest industries in terms of digital transformation because it is used to being cash-rich. We embarked on a transformation three years ago, and in 2019 we find ourselves at the forefront of companies offering such services in the region, not only in Jordan. Ours was awarded the best mobile application of mobile operators after Virgin, which has a digital business model. We see ourselves accelerating in that direction. Product availability and tailoring are the things we can offer customers, which is how we differentiate ourselves. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>One of your first initiatives as minister was to meet with all the telecoms operators. What insights did that produce, and how does the ministry support them?</h4><p>Telecoms operators are key enablers of progress for Jordan to move forward. We have extremely advanced infrastructure in Jordan, 100% mobile and internet penetration, and 93% smartphone penetration. This has not come about for free; there were huge investments behind it. There is great belief in the market and stiff competition that provides affordable services to our residents and citizens. Having said that, globally, mobile operators' revenues and profits are declining, and, accordingly, we need to take action. We are meeting with operators to come up with an innovative setup for taxes, spectrum fees, and revenue shares so that we can give the sector a positive push that benefits everyone. We are working out an agreement with operators to reinvent how things are done.</p><h4>How is this complemented by development in Jordan's telecoms infrastructure, in particular the National Broadband Network?</h4><p>Jordan has invested almost USD200 million in building around 7,000km of fiber-optic cables. This reaches almost every district of the country and provides greater access for the private sector than the current fiber network. I want the private sector to use and benefit from this advanced and widespread infrastructure. We also want to enter into a PPP to introduce another wholesale operator to reduce the overall cost of connectivity and provide higher-speed internet to the public. On top of this, we can have security services, sandboxing, and other advanced services that can be scaled up to a national level. This is one of the projects the ministry showcased at the London conference and will be opened up for partnership later in 2019.</p><h4>What more is the ministry doing to push the creation of talent in Jordan's ICT sector?</h4><p>The market requires more talent, and things are happening as a result. Jordanians are already competitive and smart; in addition, we, in cooperation with the Ministry of Labor, are training 500 people in 2019 on coding, communication and life skills, and English. Through the Al Hussein Technical University and Crown Prince Foundation, we provide a 300-hour crash course boot camp training. In 2018, 100 people were trained, and the outcome has been marvelous; we have companies lining up to hire those graduates when they finish. We are also considering a variety of other projects to create more supply and demand for quality resources, the export of services, and high-growth entrepreneurs. We have a training program, though we want to scale it up. Jordan is an opportunity for the world. We have hungry, talented youth. Some 70% of our population is young, and 22% of them studied ICT. We have successful examples of international companies operating from Jordan that serve the globe, not just the region. Jordan is the best place to get high-quality ICT services at a competitive cost. Companies are helping Jordan by employing our young people, including women, at the same time assisting a country that hosts refugees. Jordan has challenges when it comes to employment, and in ICT, significantly more jobs can be created with lower amounts of investment. There are success stories that affirm this. I was recently on a trip to the US where more ICT entities have confirmed they will open offices in Jordan. This is a growing trend.</p><h4>How do you evaluate the ministry's efforts to increase opportunities for women in ICT?</h4><p>Our ministry has almost 50% female staff. We are opening our daycare center soon to support working mothers. Building this daycare was my first decision when I joined the government, and we did it in six months. Today, more than 50% of ICT graduates are women, and women working in the ICT sector contribute three times the average female contribution to the labor force. ICT can truly lead the way in employing women and giving them opportunities to contribute to the economy. More needs to happen in terms of working from home and creating more daycare facilities. We have just passed a labor law requiring daycare to be made available whenever there are 15 parents of either sex in a workplace. We did not want to make this provision exclusively for females, because it would discourage people employing them. There are many other programs financed by the UN to push more female graduates into the labor market. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[lets-make-a-deal]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you evaluate Jordan's ability to withstand external pressures and remain a stable, globally significant economy?</h4><p>Our biggest challenge is the lack of stability in the region over the past decade, which has placed a huge burden on the Jordanian economy. Today, unemployment is over 18%, and the debt-to-GDP ratio is about 96%. This has stemmed from regional circumstances—the closure of traditional export markets, the cessation of Egyptian gas, and the huge influx of Syrian refugees. The positive side is that Jordan has been one of the most stable countries, globally, since the 1950s. Having withstood this regional turbulence and recent inflow of refugees, the Jordanian economy has proven its resiliency and stability. Roughly 20% of our current population arrived in a short period of time with no food, shelter, or other basic necessities, and Jordan has provided for them. An economy that can withstand this cannot be classified as anything short of a strong economy, and we are moving on. In 2018, Jordan's exports increased by 3.9%, and we export to over 130 countries around the world. We have reached a new deal with the EU regarding our Rules of Origin agreement. This is unique compared with anyone else in the world in terms of arrangements with the EU. Although there are only 10 million people in Jordan, which is a relatively small market, anyone who opens a factory or provides services in Jordan gains access to a market of over 1 billion people, including developed markets and high-income economies such as the US, the EU, and Canada. Furthermore, the government is committed to taking clear steps to enhance the economy. These initiatives have started with improving the ease of doing business, online registration of companies, and launching trademarks in December 2018. We are continuing with improvements in the entire business journey to make sure it is as smooth and easy as possible. We are encouraging exports and introducing government-financed programs to help companies looking to export their products outside Jordan. In terms of bilateral relations, we have a great relationship with our Iraqi friends, and exports to Iraq have started to increase significantly. We expect a huge increase in exports to Iraq in 2019.</p><h4>In addition to expanding trade with traditional partners in the region, and as part of Jordan's strategy to diversify its trading partners, what other countries do you seek to enhance trade links with in the coming years?</h4><p>I look at it in the short and long term. In the short term, we are keen to enhance trade with the places we already have bilateral agreements with, namely the EU, the US, Canada, and regional countries. In the medium to long term, Jordan seeks a bigger presence in the African market. The new Rules of Origin agreement with the EU will be extremely important for this short-term strategy. Firstly, many Jordanian manufacturers will be able to export to the EU market customs free. Second, investors will be able to open factories here and start businesses with a bigger market. They will be able to sell inside Jordan, Iraq, the region, and beyond to the US, Canada, and the EU. This creates unparalleled market access. Our manufacturers are already starting to see an increase in their export volumes.</p><h4>What stage has the renegotiation of Jordan's free trade agreement with Turkey reached?</h4><p>There have been a number of meetings, though we have terminated the existing agreement because we wanted a wider commercial relationship with our Turkish partners. The old agreement focused solely on goods, and we are looking at a wider agreement that focuses on goods, services, joint activities, investment, and other areas. We are in talks with our Turkish friends on this front, though we have not signed a new agreement yet.</p><h4>How is the Ministry of Industry, Trade, and Supply working to encourage PPPs and SMEs in Jordan?</h4><p>We are working on multiple fronts. One of the main front is the enhancement of exports, both of services and products, which is why in 4Q2018 we launched a program that will continue to promote and enhance exports in 2019. Specifically, we help SMEs that are exporting goods or services with training, coaching, networking, finding new markets, and financing whereby we effectively go into partnership with them. To enhance exports further, we are creating an export house in Jordan that will be equally owned by the private and public sectors. That will be a non-profit entity aimed at enhancing exports using various techniques and means, including mentoring, exhibitions, networking, and training. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main achievements for AICJ over the last few years?</h4><p>AICJ has a long history in the local insurance market and has always been an excellent, reputable company. We made some big changes at AICJ to reflect changes in the market, including diversifying our portfolio, working to acquire a larger market share, and becoming more competitive. A major achievement is that we have enlarged our portfolio in all our insurance lines. Our market share has also grown, and, at the same time, we have been profitable in our insurance lines. We have also effected changes in the structure of our workforce and taken on a large number of new employees with great experience to enhance our performance in every department. We have launched a major marketing campaign to promote AICJ's latest products and services. In 4Q2018, after two years' work, we launched our new IT system, which is now fully operational. Today, AICJ is growing in terms of volume by applying a stricter underwriting policy to concentrate on the bottom rather than the top line.</p><h4>The life insurance market has been a focus for Arabia Insurance Lebanon. Does the group share knowledge and experience between its operations in different countries?</h4><p>Arabia Insurance Lebanon is our parent company and has branches in all the GCC countries. But in Jordan, AICJ is a Jordanian shareholding company with Arabia Insurance Lebanon as the major shareholder, at 51%. While AICJ is not a branch of Arabia Insurance Lebanon, there is definitely cooperation. AICJ is a standalone company, but we do try to exchange ideas and experience and work together on servicing multinational clients that have a presence in Jordan and elsewhere. We do not have shared products. Arabia Insurance Lebanon has an excellent life scheme that it is promoting in the GCC and elsewhere called Arabia Lifestyle. However, we have our own life products that we tailor and sell in the local market.</p><h4>What makes AICJ stand out in Jordan's small and highly competitive insurance landscape?</h4><p>We focus on our long presence in the market and rely on our solid client base. We also have excellent relationships with A-rated international re-insurers, which helps us provide great coverage for our clients. Our main shareholders, Arabia Insurance Lebanon and Jordan Ahli Bank, together with AICJ's other shareholders, including some prominent merchants and business people, all have a solid reputation in the Arab world. This gives us excellent support and enables us to be active in the market. We also stand out because we invest in recruiting high-caliber local insurance specialists for all our business lines.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the company, insurance sector, and the Jordanian economy in 2019?</h4><p>The country is part of a turbulent region of the world, but we are glad to be in Jordan because we have a stable political system. Overall, the people are pleased with the country's leadership, and they are a well-educated population that loves their country. There is no issue with maintaining this stable atmosphere in the country. Unfortunately, geographically, politically, and economically, Jordan is affected by the surrounding environment. This is why it is difficult to predict the future. We cross our fingers that the situation in Syria and Iraq calms down, and we hope that the political situation in the region will improve. 2018 was a tough year in all respects. In 2019, there will be an improvement in the political and economic situation in the region, which will reflect well on the business side and for individuals in terms of earnings and their ability to spend on new products and services. For AICJ, I hope we will maintain our success and continue to grow and increase our profitability. We want to achieve a more active role in servicing the local market with our insurance products and services. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>ASE celebrates 20 years in 2019. What have been some of its main highlights in recent years?</h4><p>Many developments have taken place at ASE in recent years. 2017 will be marked as a cornerstone of the history of Jordan Capital Market, which was established according to the law of 1976 and inaugurated trading on January 1, 1978. On February 20, 2018, ASE was registered as a public shareholding company fully owned by the government, and ASE became a for-profit company. This transformation will enhance the economic benefits offered by ASE to the national economy and will enable it to offer better services, attract new companies and new clients, as well as form alliances and strategic partnerships with regional and international stock exchanges.</p><h4>What does the ASE strategic plan entail?</h4><p>In 2015, the ASE Board of Directors approved the ASE Strategic Plan for the Years (2016-2018), which is in line with the Jordan 2025 Vision. The plan includes many projects such as: implementing a new electronic trading system, implementing an XBRL disclosure system for the listed companies and brokerage firm, and many other projects. In 2017, as a result of the transformation of ASE into a for-profit public shareholding company, the strategic plan was revised upon the new legal form, and a new plan was prepared for 2018-2020 with the main goal of enhancing the investment environment in ASE and developing different work aspects thereof. The new plan includes the main projects of the capital market development roadmap that was issued in 2017 by the Jordan Securities Commission (JSC) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). This plan entails a significant number of projects.</p><h4>How do you plan to achieve sustainability?</h4><p>ASE is developing and promoting the investment environment in Jordan as well as encouraging the listed companies to adopt best practices in the relationship to all relevant stakeholders. In 2016, ASE joined the Sustainable Stock Exchange Initiative (SSE)—an initiative launched by the United Nations in 2009 to raise awareness of sustainably and promote environmental, social, governance (ESG) disclosure. Since then, ASE has taken steps toward increasing the awareness of the importance of sustainability in the Jordanian Capital Market. Key to this is the issuance of the Guidance on Sustainability Report, which includes steps for companies regarding sustainability reporting and the information to be included in addition to how they disclose their sustainability performance.</p><h4>How do you attract investors from outside of the country?</h4><p>Since its establishment, ASE has always been regarded as one of the most robust and well-organized stock exchanges in the region. ASE is characterized by its regulations, which are in accordance with international standards; its high-tech trading system; sophisticated technical infrastructure; and the adoption of professional conduct from all market participants. ASE is in the final stages of implementing the XBRL disclosure system that will enable investors from around the  world to receive timely, accurate, and bilingual disclosures in Arabic and English.</p><h4>What specifically are you doing to bring SMEs to the market, and how do you integrate international best practices?</h4><p>SMEs play a vital role in generating economic growth in the world's economies. SMEs play a significant part in creating jobs, building thriving private sectors, and diversifying economies. One of the projects in ASE's strategic plan is “Issuers outreach." This will focus on encouraging SMEs to become shareholding companies and list on ASE. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been your main achievements over the last few years?</h4><p>BLOM Bank Jordan is a foreign bank working in Jordan. We were established in 2004 in Jordan and concentrate on retail banking. We benefit from good experience and management in Lebanon in the fields of infrastructure, IT, and retail products such as credit cards and e-banking as well as car and housing loans.</p><h4>Are there any challenges in the Jordanian financial sector?</h4><p>All banks are changing now toward fintech and e-payments. I see the challenge as twofold: the cultural shift with customers who are less aware, and the risks that come with highly educated customers. Cyber risk is important, and BLOM Bank has the best IT solutions. We continue to develop security solutions and have received many regional recognitions for the security of our IT solutions and systems.</p><h4>How does digitalization factor into the bank's operations and strategy?</h4><p>Digitalization in the Jordanian banking sector as a whole has developed over the last two years, especially e-banking and online payments. We have software that allows any customer to pay any invoice through the internet and mobile banking. E-cash development is growing in Jordan as well.</p><h4>What role does Jordan play in BLOM Bank's portfolio?</h4><p>We are working to develop products, but the greatest challenge is the macroeconomic situation. This directly affects banks, especially in retail banking. Jordan is almost on its own in the region, and we face the challenge of how to progress without fully open borders. But the banking sector here still has significant opportunities to develop. It needs more development, and we can do a great deal more in e-banking. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Would you give us a brief overview of Standard Chartered's evolution in Jordan, its commitment to the country, and the bank's current direction?</h4><p>Standard Chartered was the first bank to launch operations in Jordan through its acquisition of ANZ Grindlays Bank in 2000 and its earlier acquisition of the Ottoman Bank, which was established in 1925. Our heritage and values are expressed in our brand promise: Here for good. With more than 86,000 employees and a presence in 60 markets, our network serves customers in close to 150 markets worldwide. We are listed on the London and Hong Kong Stock Exchanges as well as the Bombay and National Stock Exchanges in India. In Jordan, we have third-generation clients, which shows how we have built trust and long-term relationships. For us, it is not just about providing clients with the normal banking service; as an international bank, we focus on building long-term relationships where we can add value for clients and share our international experience.</p><h4>How is Standard Chartered responding to digitalization in the sector?</h4><p>A bank has to understand the market and employ talented people. Equally important, a bank has to understand the cycle of a particular business and what it needs to grow further, expand, or face challenging times. At present, the traditional banking sector is facing newcomers in the form of fintechs that could change the entire banking sector. Therefore, we need to be prepared for digitalization in order to avoid any challenge. In 2017, we have started increasing investments in our distribution channels by introducing mobile banking and changing our online banking interface to increase convenience and reach for our clients. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the bank's history in Jordan and its recent main achievements?</h4><p>SGBJ is part of SGBL Group, the Lebanon-based regional financial services group. SGBL investment in SGBJ dates back to 1999, when the group saw Jordan, known for its political stability, as an important business hub. As part of its regional expansion, the group acquired a stake of 37% in MEIB with a management contract, progressively increasing its participation to 87%, demonstrating its strong interest and commitment to the country. We initially started as a boutique bank focusing on corporate lending for key elite clients and subsequently shifted into a universal bank offering wide array of diversified services. Today, SGBJ has 19 branches, and our services cover all segments including retail, corporate, private banking and SME clients. We also have a 100% owned brokerage subsidiary, and in 2017, we launched a leasing company as well.</p><h4>What are SGBJ's expansion plans?</h4><p>With the recent acquisition in mid Nov 2018, we are currently consolidating our operations. We have launched a post migration project immediately after data migration/ business integration, focusing on the retention of the business. In addition, we are working on improving our IT systems, digitalization, mobile banking, and the like. We continue to expand internally or through organic growth. In parallel, we have positioned ourselves and stand ready to react fast and efficiently to external growth opportunities as they emerge, aiming to increase our shareholders' value. Finally, we recently increased the capital of our brokerage company to JOD3 million in order to offer margin trading facilities to our clients.</p><h4>What characteristics make SGBJ stand out given the fierce competition in Jordan's banking sector?</h4><p>Our niche comes from being part of an international group having name recognition, adopting best practices and standards, and offering niche products tailored to clients' needs. We benefit from the professionalism of each of the group's lines. For example, in terms of asset management and private banking, we have access to our group, which is considered among the top in the world. In corporate banking, Société Générale's capabilities in trade finance are well recognized. With regard to foreign companies that are looking to invest in Jordan, they have come to work with us because we can meet their unique set of needs. Therefore, we have a big platform with a presence in Lebanon, Cyprus, Jordan, Abu Dhabi, as well as Monaco and Paris, where the SGBL group have recently acquired a private bank. In terms of products, we have the know-how of the group and benefit from its innovations. We remain active on all fronts and offer personalized services. Our dedicated relationship manager serves as the focal point of contact to their clients on advising the appropriate facilities structure and the suitable financial product in accordance with the client's needs and expectations. We deal with clients as advisers more than simply as bankers. This is embedded in the culture of the bank and forms an essential ingredient of our strength. Finally, we have the four values of the group imbedded in our employees' culture: innovation, responsibility, teamwork, and commitment, which position us to stand out in this competitive market.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead, and what specific developments is SGBJ prioritizing?</h4><p>First, we want to digest and develop NBAD's business operations and clientele base. We intend to grow internally and externally as opportunities arise. In 2019, we also plan to position ourselves to be ready for the Iraqi market. Most of our clients have frozen their businesses in recent years as the economy was severely affected by the regional events in Iraq and Syria and their repercussions on trade, tourism and public finances. We are optimistic that things should start picking up now and believe the London Conference will put projects on the table. We are here to take part in these upcoming opportunities. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you elaborate more on your work with SMEs and its significance for Jordan's economy?</h4><p>More than 95% of the companies and institutions operating in Jordan are considered SMEs, and in terms of value, SMEs are also quite significant. Jordan has recognized this and realized that we need to enable SMEs to do more business and grow. Over the past six or seven years, the ecosystem around SMEs has improved significantly. Capital Bank has had significant focus on this sector. A few years ago, we established a specialized team to cover SMEs, and we have 30 bankers who only focus on SME banking. We also have specific programs that are only offered for SME banking. Our focus is on cashflow-based lending, while most banks do asset-based lending, which is not very helpful for SMEs because typically they do not have large assets to pledge to the banks. With a cashflow-based approach, we are able to facilitate these loans and capital for SMEs to grow their business. We also utilize technical assistance provided by global development financial institutions</p><h4>What is Capital Bank doing in terms of digitalization efforts and technological innovation?</h4><p>We have allocated more than USD60 million for investment in technology. Admittedly, we were behind—the entire market was behind. However, we have all come to understand financial inclusion; a few years ago, it was less than 27%, and now it is about 32% because banks have woken up and understood the importance of digitalizing. More investment in technology is the key for improving efficiency. We have also invested heavily in omni channels. Starting in summer 2019, we will launch our digital platform. We aim to launch products quarterly and automate internally so our people can focus on value-added services instead of doing manual, repetitive work.</p><h4>How else does Capital Bank distinguish itself in Jordan's competitive banking sector?</h4><p>We are undergoing a digital transformation that is unlike other banks in Jordan. In Jordan, there are two major banks, and the rest have historically been asset-takers. The power of the larger banks will be disrupted by the digital transformation that we and a few other banks are implementing. We are doing it in a slightly smarter way because of the technologies in which we are choosing to invest. If a client that historically had its cash management or trade business with one of the big banks takes an asset from us, the loan is not highly profitable for a bank like ours. We want all the ancillary business. We hope to get more of their business with our new digital products, such as on-premises check deposit machines to remove the need for clients' movement between their premises and the bank. We also have the strongest investment bank, which adds tremendous value to clients. Jordan has been given preferential treatment from Iraq for 184 imported products, but not all Jordanian products are exempt from these taxes. Jordanian manufacturers or producers wanting to sell or invest in Iraq need financial advisors. We are able to do that because we have the best corporate finance and brokerage teams in the country. The advice we give clients is based on our track record and knowledge, which gives our clients a huge value-added bonus.</p><h4>How do you evaluate the main challenges and opportunities in Jordan's financial sector?</h4><p>The SME side is interesting because banks that have grown over the past years are those that were focused on the SME sector. However, on the corporate and retail banking side, the markets are quite saturated. In retail, the best thing to do is start going after the unbanked through digital products. Zain Cash, the biggest wallet today, has more clients than most banks. It started operating in 2017, so that should be a cue to all of us. Banks need to think outside the box and look at the opportunities outside the market. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess Jordan's economic and financial performance in recent years?</h4><p>Jordan's economy has shown resilience over the past few years, despite precarious regional developments. In 2017, GDP grew by 2.1% in real terms compared to 2% in 2016, while in nominal terms GDP grew by 3.9% in 2017 compared to 3.4% in 2016. The primary objective of CBJ is to maintain monetary and financial stability. In addition, CBJ stands ready to respond to any internal or external shocks by using its monetary tools. In 2017 and 2018, CBJ raised the interest rates on its monetary policy instruments eight times over the two years by 225 basis points, in addition to an increase of 25 basis points in late 2016, in order to preserve monetary stability and ensure a competitive return on JOD-denominated assets. Despite the increases in the monetary policy interest rate, credit facilities extended by licensed banks to the private sector grew by 9.3% in 2017 and 5.9% in the first 11 months of 2018. Moreover, foreign reserves remained at a comfortable level, USD13.4 billion, covering more than seven months of the Kingdom's imports in 2018. Furthermore, the government continued to pursue its national economic and structural reform program in 2018 in cooperation with the IMF. Accordingly, the government has implemented a new bundle of corrective fiscal measures to adjust fiscal positions and enhance domestic revenues through mitigating distortions in the tax system caused by the unjustified expansions in tax exemptions. Consequently, the budget deficit, including foreign grants, declined by 0.2 percentage points to reach JOD727.6 million, or 2.4% of GDP, in 2018, compared to a budget deficit of JOD747.9 million (2.6% of GDP) in 2017. However, gross public debt reached 94% of GDP at the end of 2018 compared to 94.3% at the end of 2017.</p><h4>What have been the effects of the implementation of IFRS 9 standard and its importance for the economy?</h4><p>CBJ is keen to continue its leadership of the banking sector and retain the status of the banking sector as one of the most important pillars of the national economy. This leadership role mainly involves implementing and following international standards and practices. Among such standards is the IFRS 9, which became effective as of January 2018. Implementing the new standard will have implications in the banking and credit environment through enhancing the soundness and robustness of banks' financial positions, improving risk management in the banking environment, and boosting the quality of credit portfolios and credit granting procedures. Furthermore, these instructions will imply interconnections with other supervisory requirements, such as Basel III, capital adequacy, and liquidity. In order to properly implement the standard, banks should identify their strategic actions in the following areas: reconsidering their allocation of lending to economic sectors with greater sensitivity to the economic cycle, readjusting their loan-loss provisions, revising commercial policies as product economics and profitability change, and reforming credit-management practices to prevent exposures from deteriorating.</p><h4>How do you evaluate the progress thus far toward the goals outlined in the National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS) 2018-2020?</h4><p>Overall, access to finance has improved in recent years, but disparities remain for the majority of the population and vulnerable groups continue to be disadvantaged. As NFIS has become a widely used tool for accelerating financial inclusion in most countries, CBJ launched NFIS in December 2017 with two national goals: to increase access to finance for the adult population from 33.1% to 41.5% and to reduce the gender gap from 53% to 35%. The strategy overall builds on a set of priority policy areas, three of which form the core industry pillars: microfinance, digital financial services, and SME finance. Four areas are considered cross-cutting enablers that facilitate the development of industries and make them more robust: fintech; financial consumer protection and financial capabilities; data and research; and laws, regulations, and instructions. While financial inclusion targets all segments, NFIS prioritizes certain segments: the most vulnerable groups that traditionally have lower levels of financial inclusion and the bottom 40% of households in terms of income, which comprise women, youth, and refugees. The strategy is expected to contribute to reducing socioeconomic inequalities, which will be a result of the convergence of a number of developments, such as new and more adequate funding sources and other financial services for the largely financially constrained SMEs. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What makes the financial sector such a strong pillar of the economy?</h4><p>The Jordanian financial sector has been stable during the last few years despite the challenges resulting from the political and economic conditions in the region. Central bank policies helped to mitigate this risk, as banks have enjoyed high levels of capital adequacy, comfortable levels of liquidity, and reasonable profitability.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the recently passed IMF-backed tax reform and its ability to stimulate real economic growth?</h4><p>The government launched a national dialogue on income tax reform that ultimately led to parliament's endorsement of the bill in December 2018. The new tax law will widen the tax base and introduce discipline. Revenue estimates suggest that it would yield 0.6 % of GDP in 2019 and 0.8 % over the medium term. The personal income tax reform will broaden the tax base in a way that enhances equity, with a permanent yield of 0.2% of GDP. In particular, the reform reduces the exemption to JOD10,000 and includes a new income exemption of JOD2,000 for people with permanent disabilities; makes the tax system more progressive by increasing the marginal tax rates on higher-income brackets and reducing the rate for the lowest-income earners; and expands the tax base by taxing transactions on public shares trading and introducing a presumptive income tax regime for professionals. The corporate income tax (CIT) reform decreases economic distortions and closes some gaps, while broadening the tax base, with a permanent yield of 0.5% of GDP. Specifically, the reform unifies the standard statutory CIT rate for the manufacturing and commercial sectors to 20%; leaves unchanged the statutory CIT rates applicable to the non-manufacturing sectors, instead introducing a surtax on corporate profits; and replaces the non-WTO-compliant export income deduction with a temporary manufacturing deduction. In terms of enforcing discipline, the new tax law will enhance the pay-as-you-earn system for large taxpayers and improve taxpayer registration, ensuring that the issuance of a business license is linked with the issue of a taxpayer identification number.</p><h4>What are the ministry's priorities and strategy for lowering public debt in cooperation with international organizations?</h4><p>Since 2016, the government has remained committed to the IMF's economic reform program, the Extended Fund Facility, of which the main objectives are reducing the primary deficit of the central government by adopting fiscal measures for both revenues and expenditures with inclusive growth considerations that will help the government to reduce needed financing and the debt-to-GDP ratio. Besides that, the government will enhance the quality, planning, and effectiveness of debt management of the central government, the National Electric Power Company (NEPCO), and the Water Authority of Jordan (WAJ) through the preparation and publication of a medium-term debt strategy for the central government debt, which will include measurers for maintaining NEPCO's operational balance and WAJ's overall budget deficit, helping Jordan to reduce public debt and enhance transparency. The objectives of debt management strategy are: increasing the foreign exchange as a percentage of total debt; extending the average maturity of domestic debt by issuing debt instruments with long-term maturity; reducing the cost of interest payments by increasing the concessional loans from the London Initiative conference; issuing Islamic Sukuk to diversify the financing sources and expand the investor base in government debt securities; and decreasing the share of debt maturing within one year. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>October 2018 marked two years for CRIF Jordan. What have been your focus and main achievements thus far?</h4><p>The Credit Bureau Law was passed in 2010 in Jordan, making it possible to establish a credit bureau. Since the law mandated that banks join the credit bureau once it was up and running our focus in the first year was on getting banks into compliance. The second year was about bringing into the credit bureau the non-bank financial institutions, which is all the lenders in the financial sector that are not obligated to join. The efforts were highly focused on adding value to the credit bureau by having more members outside of the banking sector. In 2018, we focused on the leasing and microfinance sectors, as well as insurance companies and telecoms. We have succeeded in engaging seven out of eight microfinance institutions who are members of the MFIs network “Tanmeya." Telecoms are extremely important, and we hope that they will be joining soon. In the Doing Business report published annually by the World Bank, in terms of access to credit, Jordan's rating is highly dependent on the credit bureau coverage. The data from these entities is important to us, and it improves access to finance, especially for non-bankable people and small entrepreneurs.</p><h4>What role does digitalization play at CRIF, and on which innovations are you focusing?</h4><p>Financial institutions today are competing for customers through innovation. One of which is offering and processing loans online in a digital format. The Central Bank of Jordan is making efforts to promote digital finance. We are working with banks to ensure they are working digitally with us rather than printing and processing reports.</p><h4>What is your outlook going into 2019?</h4><p>I am optimistic. We want to show our older members how much effort we have been putting into bringing more value to them. Second, we want to extract more value out of the data that we have, and scoring is a part of that, as are the value-added services. Third, we want to present some of the services that have been approved and introduce them within the next year or two. We want to focus on the retailer side and include them into our platform. There is a part of the market that is still in the shadows, which we can uncover. We play an important role in bringing all of these people and sectors together. We have been talking about the credit bureau since 1989, but only launched two years ago. We are satisfied in terms of bringing services to life in a short period of time and working with the contributors to improve data quality. To that end, Crif Jordan and the bureau members have done an excellent job as the hit rate reached 78% within the first two years of operations; of 100 people one might inquire about, they will find the information they seek 78% of the time, which is an excellent rate. We hope to reach 80-82% by the time we engage all the other sectors in Jordan. The higher the hit rate, the higher the chance of people accessing finance, as long as they have good credit. Even though the economy is weak and consumer confidence is low, one of the things I am optimistic about is the border between Jordan and neighboring countries such as Iraq and Syria. We will soon resume exports and imports; banks and merchants have to be ready. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What opportunities are emerging to export technologies from Jordan?</h4><p>In the case of renewable energy in particular, Jordan is a regional leader in solar photovoltaic (PV). It was the first country to establish multiple, commercially based solar PV independent power producers (IPPs). Jordanian companies are now looking at Egypt, Lebanon, Tunisia, Morocco, Palestine, and Saudi Arabia to develop and execute projects. The same happened in solar heating after we invested in Millennium Energy Industries, a specialized Jordanian solar heating EPC with proprietary cooling and desalination technology. The opportunity for Jordan in solar energy is the regional market and perhaps the CIS region.</p><h4>What dimensions does Catalyst Investment Management bring to its partnerships?</h4><p>One of the dimensions we bring is our leading regional experience in solar PV. Our second strength is our credentials, as our investors are primarily European government investors.</p><h4>Catalyst Investment Management's new fund seeks to co-develop over 700MW of renewable projects. What are the latest updates on that plan?</h4><p>We have a finite amount of capital, though it also depends on how we bring partners into our projects, not to mention the costs, which are falling. We already have 43MW either in operation or under construction. We are currently pursuing about another 200MW through bidding or negotiating. Thus far, 80% of activity is in Jordan, though we target a ratio of 70% in Jordan and 30% in other markets. We are also bidding on projects and studying opportunities in wind, storage, LED lighting, and solar thermal. Outside of Jordan, we are exploring opportunities in Egypt, Tunisia, and Morocco. We also feel that Palestine, Iraq, and Syria are important in terms of exporting electricity from Jordan. They are on the government's agenda because we have too much power and renewable energy in Jordan, which is a problem for the local renewables industry. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you provide some highlights of EDAMA's last 10 years and a few of your goals moving forward? </h4><p>EDAMA was mainly the focus of a group of people supported by different organizations to raise awareness regarding renewable clean energy, the environment, and water. Jordan imports most of its energy resources, and those resources are extremely expensive. In terms of water, we are the second-poorest country in the world, which places a great pressure on the country. We are a pressure group aimed at developing the impact of renewable energy. While the share of renewable of the total energy produced is less than 10% of total production, we are dedicated to expanding our presence further.</p><h4>How do you plan to push the private sector toward renewable energy?</h4><p>We are a fully democratic group, and our board members are elected every two years. They have a plan for pushing private-sector participation, and we continue to pursue these goals. We have pushed to stop some mining processes and have fought nuclear energy development. There should be a combination of energy sources, though we are in favor of increasing the share of renewable energy as much as possible. We are in direct contact with the government and work in tandem on projects. Regarding new renewable projects, we advocate for these with our members and partners in various departments of the government, embassies, and financial institutions. We work with groups like the World Bank, IFC, EBRD, EIB, and local Jordanian banks that give credit to investors as well as consumers interested in renewables.</p><h4>What is Jordan's capacity for exporting its local expertise in this area, and how does EDAMA play a role in doing so?</h4><p>Different Jordanian corporations have developed outside connections via EDAMA. Jordanians are working on projects in Spain, North Africa, and Eastern Europe. In Jordan, our people and expertise truly set us apart. We produce fine young graduates in numerous areas of energy and water engineering whose skills could be utilized both in Jordan and abroad. However, we are facing a tough political situation in the region, and unless we see more communication and open borders, we might have a hard time. We are hopeful that reconstruction in Syria and Iraq will raise the level of know-how in their respective localities by utilizing Jordanian expertise.</p><h4>How exactly do you envision the development of local industry and expertise?</h4><p>We have many companies coming from the Emirates to do business in renewable energies, and they increasingly seek to utilize Jordanian expertise. At this level, we can work with the government to develop cooperation agreements with different countries. We can also count on our members to develop Jordan's capabilities at home and abroad. Part of this is developing expertise at the university level. </p><h4>Where do you see the most opportunities for improvement?</h4><p>The government signed an agreement for importing gas, which means we will have excess energy supply. Still, importing cheap gas for energy is not being reflected on end consumers. We also want to see cleaner Euro 5 diesel applied more extensively across the country. The most problematic area is still water; we have not completed any new desalination projects, and we have not developed any new water resources. The influx of refugees also added to shortages in water supplies. In 2019, we will be focusing on water desalination projects and their impact on the Dead Sea and Jordan Valley. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What opportunities are emerging to export technologies from Jordan?</h4><p>In the case of renewable energy in particular, Jordan is a regional leader in solar photovoltaic (PV). It was the first country to establish multiple, commercially based solar PV independent power producers (IPPs). Jordanian companies are now looking at Egypt, Lebanon, Tunisia, Morocco, Palestine, and Saudi Arabia to develop and execute projects. The same happened in solar heating after we invested in Millennium Energy Industries, a specialized Jordanian solar heating EPC with proprietary cooling and desalination technology. The opportunity for Jordan in solar energy is the regional market and perhaps the CIS region.</p><h4>What dimensions does Catalyst Investment Management bring to its partnerships?</h4><p>One of the dimensions we bring is our leading regional experience in solar PV. Our second strength is our credentials, as our investors are primarily European government investors.</p><h4>Catalyst Investment Management's new fund seeks to co-develop over 700MW of renewable projects. What are the latest updates on that plan?</h4><p>We have a finite amount of capital, though it also depends on how we bring partners into our projects, not to mention the costs, which are falling. We already have 43MW either in operation or under construction. We are currently pursuing about another 200MW through bidding or negotiating. Thus far, 80% of activity is in Jordan, though we target a ratio of 70% in Jordan and 30% in other markets. We are also bidding on projects and studying opportunities in wind, storage, LED lighting, and solar thermal. Outside of Jordan, we are exploring opportunities in Egypt, Tunisia, and Morocco. We also feel that Palestine, Iraq, and Syria are important in terms of exporting electricity from Jordan. They are on the government's agenda because we have too much power and renewable energy in Jordan, which is a problem for the local renewables industry. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us a brief introduction to KADDB and its pioneering approach to innovation?</h4><p>Once considered to be the home for global innovation and creativity, the Arab world currently lags behind most of the international community in terms of its contribution to scientific research and technical development. As disappointing as that may seem, recognizing the issue is the first step toward solving it. This is the context in which His Majesty King Abdullah II established the King Abdullah II Design and Development Bureau (KADDB) in 1999 with the intention of serving Jordan by reinforcing our independence and leading the region in innovation. KADDB designs and develops, tests and evaluates, and produces the most optimized defense solutions for Jordan's Armed Forces (JAF) and regional allies. We empower a qualified local workforce, employ cutting-edge technologies, and rely on international partnerships to improve our kingdom's global standing. Over the past 20 years, KADDB's scope has greatly expanded. We currently manufacture armored vehicles, command and control systems, communications and reconnaissance equipment, operator protective equipment, small arms, and ammunition of various calibers. Although KADDB's focus is mainly on the defense and security industry, we continue to contribute to the betterment of Jordan's economy and education, addressing a range of dimensions by providing a large number of job opportunities, partnering with numerous Jordanian companies, and funding various university research programs. We also boost tourism and hospitality through our very own biennial defense and security exhibition, which specializes in special operations forces and homeland security, Special Operations Forces Exhibition and Conference (SOFEX), unique for its kind in the region.</p><h4>What is KADDB's strategy to make Jordan a regional defense industry hub?</h4><p>KADDB will continue to take advantage of multiple factors, such as Jordan's strategic location, political stability, and highly qualified and skilled manpower to sustain and advance our military superiority and ensure our products and solutions are reliable and competitive. As it stands, KADDB has the only testing center in the region certified by the UK Accreditation Service (UKAS) that conducts a wide variety of tests. These include vehicle mobility, armoring, ballistic material testing, as well as weapon and ammunition testing. Our testing facility has a large number of international customers due to the successful reputation we have built over the years. KADDB also seeks to expand in a large number of new fields, including artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, encryption, unmanned systems, 3D printing, and jamming devices, for example. This expansion will provide further opportunities for global partnerships in order to make Jordan a regional defense industry hub and build a reputation as the partner of choice in the region. </p><h4>Which markets are you looking at specifically for KADDB?</h4><p>When KADDB was inaugurated, it sought to establish itself as a regional niche in the MENA region, which continues to be its main goal. Primarily, we pursue partnerships and ventures of mutual benefit, as it is crucial to create added value for Jordan and KADDB, whether via transfer of technology or commercial contractual relations. We seek win-win partnerships from across the world, specifically the East Asia and Africa. Due to the rapid growth and development of the African market, this has become our main interest, as there are diverse opportunities to promote partnerships, especially in the defense and security industry. œ–</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is KPMG's history in Jordan and its key business segments?</h4><p>KPMG in Jordan was established as a correspondent firm in 2006. In 2010, we were promoted to a full member firm. At that time, we employed approximately 15 people, and now our family has grown to include around 200 staff in Jordan working in audit, tax, and advisory. KPMG Kawasmy &amp; Partners is one of the leading professional services firms in the county, and we have recently extended our services to cover Iraq and Palestine. The KPMG network of independent member firms is one of the largest professional service networks in the Middle East &amp; South Asia region, with over 8,000 professionals and associates working across 33 office locations in 15 countries and territories and forming a key part of the wider KPMG global network that spans 153 countries and territories and employs 207,000 people around the world. KPMG professionals are committed to providing clients with excellence and high-quality service and are quick to embrace the challenges that lie ahead.</p><h4>How does KPMG Academy services contribute to building up Jordan's human resource capacity and sharing it with the region?</h4><p>KPMG Academy services is part of the Jordanian firm, our mission is to create a strong network of accounting professionals and to spread professional certification culture amongst accounting and business graduates. We help our students prepare for important, international professional certifications such as CPA and CMA by providing the relevant courses taught by highly qualified professional instructors and consultants. Every year, more than 300 students enroll in various courses/workshops at KPMG Academy. We strongly believe in practical professional knowledge, therefore, we offer these newly graduated students hands-on experience and internships at KPMG in Jordan, to empower and to help them at the start of their professional careers, which also reflect positively on the Jordanian economy. Although the economic situation in Jordan is critical, we still have many opportunities, most importantly our human resources. Our people are extremely talented and highly educated and can serve investors to achieve their goals. Second, we have great opportunities in the energy and power sector. We encourage investors to come to Jordan and invest in this sector, including key areas of growth such as power generation, municipal gas systems, oil and shale. We also consider Jordan to be the main hub for information technology and communication systems in the region. Jordan fosters many entrepreneurs and start-ups in this sector. We also have opportunities with logistics, transportation and healthcare. Moreover, Jordan's strategic geographic location connecting Europe and Asia means there are many great opportunities yet to be discovered.</p><h4>What is your strategy for expansion?</h4><p>The KPMG strategy was launched recently by Bill Thomas, the KPMG International chairman; it is extremely optimistic and ambitious. In order to achieve this strategy, there are two main factors to work on. The first is trust—in our people, from our clients, and with the public. It also includes growth, which requires the right people, the right resources, and great relationships with clients, communities, and the public sector. Growth and trust are complementary pillars of the strategy. KPMG in Jordan's main role is to help increase trust in KPMG through our commitment to high-quality service and building our relationships to achieve that growth and open new markets. Competitively, our advantage is the creativity of our people. We remain up to date with trends in technology and services as well. More specifically, KPMG member firms have invested heavily in cybersecurity, AI, and all new technologies, such as blockchain. We strive to create new opportunities for our people to inspire them and encourage change. We seek to empower innovation through delegation. We believe KPMG in Jordan is a leading economic force in the region, because of the strong ties to our people, clients, and communities. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the latest updates on the expansion of KHBP to over 3 million sqm of top-quality office space and mixed-use developments?</h4><p>The expansion is building on the success KHBP has had over the past years in attracting local, regional, and international companies. We have reached 100% occupancy, and there is high demand, both from within and outside, to expand. KHBP, as a business hub and innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem, is one of a few of its kind in the region. Our expansion was, therefore, a choice as well as a necessity. The master plan includes land use, phasing, and steps to attract different developers to the business park. We also looked at the risks a real estate developer might face and worked to eliminate or minimize those. One risk is the legal framework. Fortunately, development zones like ours are under the well-defined Jordan Investment Commission framework. We also did a marketing study; developers look for anchor tenants, and these take a long time and are costly to attract; however, as an existing business park, with King Hussein Medical City right next door, KHBP already has its anchor tenants in place.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What industries are being added to the industrial cluster in MDA?</h4><p>The industrial area is 2.5 million sqm, of which 800,000sqm, or 30%, is completely developed. Recently, we have around 36 investments with signed contracts, 25 of which are now operational. The total investment size is around USD130 million. The sectors or zones that are operational now include a glass coating factory with a Kuwaiti investment of around USD60 million. We also have around 15 small to medium-sized factories in the fertilizing segment as well as a washing machine factory, a digital meters manufacturer, and a construction-related materials producer. Despite difficulties over the past 10 years, including turmoil in the area and instability, Ma'an managed to attract investment in the area, and we hope the coming years will be more fruitful in attracting investments, especially when it comes to megaprojects the government is working on related to MDA. The most important is the dry port next to the industrial park. All of the cargo coming to Aqaba will be transported by train to the land port, and all the storage and clearance will be done there, bringing more activity. There are also other ongoing investments such as the pipeline to Aqaba and many other megaprojects the government is discussing. Hopefully, MDA will be involved in these projects. The remaining 70% of the area to be developed will be an expansion for Phase I, as well as heavy industries, specifically silica, since the area is rich in this. It is zoned for such industries already, and we hope to see a float glass factory in the area.</p><h4>What is Hajj Oasis' part in MDA, and how does it contribute to the goals laid out by the Ministry of Tourism?</h4><p>Ma'an has been known throughout history as a stopping point for people traveling to Mecca. Before MDA and the Hajj Oasis cluster, we used to have a facility that provided pilgrims and people traveling to umrah services. However, the quality of the facility was not up to current standards. When MDA was announced in 2006-2007, His Majesty himself had a vision to build the Hajj Oasis to serve pilgrims, not only from Jordan but also Syria, Turkey, and Eastern Europe. Thus far, we have developed the first phase of the Hajj Oasis, which has been operational since 2016, at a cost of around USD6 million. We offer numerous services in a rest area with a spiritual atmosphere. We are in talks with bus companies and other transportation companies to help pilgrims gain access to the health services we provide during their stay. Our strategic plan is to promote and expand Hajj Oasis to all travelers and tourists using the highway, not only people completing hajj or umrah. As part of this strategy, we are considering renaming it the Ma'an Oasis. We are also considering adding more services that provide information about other tourism offerings and sightseeing in Jordan.</p><h4>Another important cluster is the solar park. What are your plans for the park at MDA?</h4><p>Its total area is between 1 and 5 million sqm, and it is occupied by nine companies of different nationalities, from Japan's Mitsubishi to Qatar's Nebras. They produce 165MW of electricity that is purchased by National Electric Power Company (NEPCO) for the national grid. The total investment was USD500 million and created more than 1,000 jobs during construction. The current employment for permanent jobs in the solar park is 175, and most of the workers are from the Ma'an area. The park was inaugurated by HM King Abdullah II in 2016, and we are now working to add an additional 150-MW park with two or three more companies. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Riyadh is shaping itself for the future with the metro project reaching its final stages, other infrastructural development projects and projects like KAFD and ITCC that bring new technology to the forefront. What role do you see for Riyadh guiding the urban development in the Kingdom? </h4><p>Vision 2030 formulated a broad range of objectives, improvements, and project to increase the stand of living in Saudi Arabia. Riyadh, as the capital, plays a fundamental part of this vision. Within the chamber of commerce, we have 170,000 registered commercial entities. We provide them with information, contacts, and other support services, as well as the opportunity to participate in our various committee meetings. It is important that our members voice their concerns and challenges so we can improve the business environment together. Riyadh is currently under visible rapid transformation. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has been working in just a few years to change the next 20 years. In the next five years, the Saudi economy and many aspects of life in the Kingdom will fundamentally change. The cabinet and other government entities are changing their way of working, and there are clear KPIs now. The pace of transformation reminds me of a marathon, and it is exciting to see people coming together and working together to achieve great things. With such a commitment, we will truly see improvements over the coming five to 10 years.</p><h4>There are major developments in the field of entertainment culture and sports. Do you foresee economic growth potential in this trend?</h4><p>In the entertainment industry, we are starting from scratch, as it was largely absent in the Kingdom to date. There is huge potential to build this industry and, as a government, provide opportunities for the private sector to start new businesses in this field. The Riyadh Chamber welcomes this new development, and it is establishing a dedicated entertainment committee to monitor these developments and provide a platform for industry players to discuss how we can improve the investment climate. Sports are another big and potential sector, albeit not entirely new. Football has always been popular, as well as other sports. The difference is that we see new sports, like racing, coming to town. In December 2018, we had a unique event with the Formula E race in historic Diriyah. There are already other racing classes in the Kingdom as well. These are great developments and give us the unique opportunity to put Riyadh on the map internationally, while presenting new opportunities to the local business community.</p><h4>How is the chamber assisting industrial companies to move up the value chain as part of Vision 2030?</h4><p>Supporting traditional industries is still one of the core activities of the Riyadh chamber, and we have a well-established network of committees and subject matter experts to build expertise and industry dialogue. Moving up the value chain is an important objective, especially for local manufacturing industries. It will reduce import dependency and increase export capacity. Another key objective of the Riyadh chamber is supporting SMEs; these are the true engines of jobs in the Kingdom, and this segment of the market is only set to grow even further. 70% of the Saudi population is under 30 years old, and many recent graduates are choosing jobs outside the public sector and traditional industries. We have our internal committees as well as strong partnerships with various ministries and other organization that underline SME growth.</p><h4>What is your message to foreign investors, and why is Riyadh a destination for investment and partnerships?</h4><p>In Riyadh, there is an active government working hard to assist investors. The population of Riyadh is 7.5 million, with largely young people, which means there is a strong market for a broad range of products and services. The leisure and hospitality industries are currently in exponential growth, for example. The financial infrastructure is extremely advanced, and there are many banks and financial institutions to team up with. Riyadh is an active city for business, and with a number of real estate development projects, there is no market saturation in sight yet.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Over 21,000 Vehicles Sold in Spain 2018]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[jose-maria-terol-ceo-mazda]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Tell us about Mazda's evolution in Spain? </h4><p>We started as a sales company in 2000. Previously, there was an importer selling Mazda cars in Spain. We have had a successful story here, with continuous growth from 2000 to 2008, hitting sales records year over year. Then, the recession hit the economy in 2008 and we were very impacted, as we import all the cars from Japan. Back then, the yen became quite strong so importing vehicles became more expensive. Then, additionally, we suffered the impact from the tsunami and earthquake in Japan in 2011. That affected our production. Further down the line, the Spanish market began to recovery and the exchange rate was more stable. We went back to reasonable levels. We started a complete renovation of our portfolio with the launch of our new design language, which we call Kodo, and completely new technologies under the umbrella of the Skyactiv technology. This includes the renovation of all our platforms, the transmissions, and it was absolutely huge. Thanks to these initiatives, we were able to come back and in 2018 we sold more than 21,000 vehicles in Spain. That was our year record.</p><h4>How do you plan to continue maintaining those figures?</h4><p>There are three pillars, one of them is product. We are just starting again a new renovation of our product with an evolution of the Kodo design language. It also includes a more premium feel and a highly improved level of quality in the materials we use. It is a better designed product, competing at the same level as premium brands. In addition, we plan a complete renovation of our technology. We are launching a revolutionary combustion engine that is a petrol engine, but works as a diesel engine. This means that combustion is produced by the compression and not by the spark.</p><h4>Does this system reduce CO2 emissions over the car's lifetime?</h4><p>That is our goal. We want to reduce all the emissions produced from the car itself. But it is important to measure the entire cycle of the car. This is something that will be introduced in most of the markets. Europe is the market for this kind of engine, because Europe has demanding emission policies that require the best technology available in this field. Europe will be the market in which Skyactiv-X will be developed.</p><h4>Can you tell us what are the main characteristics of the CX-30?</h4><p>In addition to hybridization and Skyactiv-X, the CX-30 is an SUV that is convenient.  SUV sales continue to grow and there is a great opportunity in this field. Also, CX-30 fits well in our offer of SUVs. So that is why it is a great addition. On top of this, the compact SUV sub-segment is growing the fastest worldwide. We will see new entries in the SUV range in the near future.</p><h4>What role will driverless cars and these systems will have in the future?</h4><p>All these systems that assist drivers are growing. It is amazing how many technologies are being applied in this field. Mazda has already implemented the co-pilot system, which is a broad system of technologies to assist the driver so that they continue to enjoy driving their cars. The driver has to always remain in command. Automation, also, although it is still some time away from what we are seeking. It will take some time to get to 100% autonomous driving systems. Many of the issues around autonomous driving are ethical, philosophical, and the complex issues raised are far from being resolved, particularly in terms of insurance and responsibility.  </p><h4>What is your opinion on the kind of future regulation in the field?</h4><p>In Europe, regulations are among the toughest. Chinese and American regulations are much more simple. In Europe, you have many countries, regions, and local governments that change their regulations constantly. That is a huge challenge for us. Therefore, car manufacturers are requesting governments try to harmonize regulations that are produced in Europe to offer a more manageable environment for companies.</p><h4>What would you demand from public administration to become more efficient?</h4><p>I would like them to take a more practical approach regarding emissions regulation. Usually, the regulations they pass have the opposite effect. Today, if we could manage to replace 25% of the oldest cars in Spain, we would reduce emissions by 75%. This means that we have old cars with extremely high-level of emissions. Hence, it is mandatory to replace those cars. Besides, there are still many barriers for pure electric vehicles. Customers are not willing to buy those cars in significant quantities. The most practical way to reduce emissions would be to replace old cars with new ones.</p><h4>What are your goals for 2020?</h4><p>It is an interesting year. Basically, it is a year in which we will have a new regulation from the EU that demands all manufacturers achieve far lower emissions in cars. So that is big. If you do not get to that kind of level, you will pay high fines. So, we require a complete re-thinking of our portfolio and sales mix.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[10 Months of Success]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[jose-luis-abalos-minister-transport-spain]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What would you highlight as the main achievements of your mandate during the last 10 months?</h4><p>My objective has been to develop infrastructure, transport, and housing policy in which the right to mobility, access to decent housing, and safety are a priority. With regard to management, I have prioritized the rationalization and reorientation of resources where they are most needed. I am convinced that we have made progress in this area by promoting measures, investments, and projects aimed to improve quality of life. Among our main achievements I would highlight the package of housing measures included in the Royal Decree, a law on urgent measures regarding housing and rent, validated by the Congress of Deputies on April 3, 2019. Some of the measures limit the rise in rental prices by establishing a maximum increase in the CPI for the duration of the lease and the extension of three to five years of the mandatory extension of these contracts, measures aimed at improve information and market transparency and specific procedures to deal with situations in which eviction affects vulnerable people or homes. In our commitment to mobility as a right, we have ensured the necessary investment in maintaining a system through high quality standards and guaranteeing user reliability, frequency, and punctuality. Among the main measures adopted, we have formalized the OSP contract with Renfe to guarantee an integrated, intermodal rail service offer adapted to the demand until December 2027. Its approval has allowed us to address an ambitious EUR3 billion plan in the first half of 2019 for the acquisition and renewal of rolling stock. We have also solved the problem of the motorways whose concession period ends in this legislature. For the first time, a government has liberalized a stretch of highway after the end of its concession period. On November 30, the stretch of the AP-I Burgos-Armiñón became toll free. In terms of toll roads, we have also unblocked the status of motorway concession contracts whose companies were in the liquidation phase, resolving the contracts, allowing Seitt to collect tolls and their management and introducing a general reduction in tariffs by 30%. In relation to railway infrastructure, we have made great progress in the main Atlantic and Mediterranean corridors and promoted improvements in the conventional network, where we have increased the tender by more than 324%. In the international arena, we have managed to get the EU to finally approve the reform of the Atlantic and Mediterranean corridors. This means that European funds with be available for investment in Spanish infrastructure. Focusing on safety as another of our strategic lines, we must always attempt to improve it. To this end, we have prepared a comprehensive report which covers the safety of transport, infrastructure maintenance, and the impact of climate change, among other relevant areas. It is a report that includes an action plan with more than 60 initiatives. For the improvement of sustainability and habitability in the field of urban development, we presented the Urban Agenda for Spain in the Council of Ministers on February 22. The first strategic document prepared in the ministry was aligned with the Action Plan of the 2030 Agenda. And, finally, in terms of investment, we seek to reverse the deficit of recent years, and advance investments and projects that allow us to continue advancing in future years. Proof of this is the bidding data for these 11 months of government. We have bid 156% more, and 74% more than in the same period of the previous year.</p><h4>The Mediterranean Corridor is under development as a future freight corridor. How did they reach the final proposal and how did they deal with the requests of each of the affected lobbyists? </h4><p>The investment in railways in general and the Mediterranean Corridor in particular fulfill an important social function for the territory, and must be considered critical state policy. This project will contribute to strengthening the Spanish economy in sectors including tourism, industry, agriculture, and logistics, among others. For this reason, we are concentrating efforts on offering a competitive service of passenger and freight transport by rail, focused on the needs and demands of customers, in terms of mobility and logistics. The territories through which the corridor passes must take advantage of the opportunity. We must not see infrastructure as an end in themselves, but as a tool to guarantee a service, improve quality of life, connect territories, create business opportunities, and boost the economic growth of a country. This is the vision toward which we are working.</p><h4>The toll motorways and the radials stopped being profitable at the hands of private companies. How does the government intend to make them profitable again, and will the state remain in the long term?</h4><p>We have solved this situation by resolving the respective contracts and modifying the Highway Law to allow the State Company State Transport Infrastructure Company (Seitt) to collect tolls and manage these highways. We have encouraged the use of these roads. An increase in traffic will increase our revenues, improve mobility, and road safety, and make better use of this infrastructure. For this, we have approved a generalized reduction of around 30%. We have already received the first satisfactory results with a 12% increase in average traffic since January.</p><h4>What do you think the effect of the different Brexit scenarios will be on the transport sector in Spain?</h4><p>From the government's point of view, we are following the unfolding of Brexit carefully and considering all possible scenarios, analyzing their impact on areas under our control and adopting measures to alleviate them. In relation to air transport, probably the most affected mode, the departure of the UK from the EU brings with it a series of risks such as a possible impact on Spanish airlines and connectivity between Spain and the UK. In this area, from the EU, work is being done on the promulgation of "contingency measures" that would apply in the event of a hard Brexit. In this regard, we have been working intensively to ensure that these measures offer the most favorable response possible to the interests of Spain and its citizens, taking into account that decision-making cannot be bilateral, but rather must be done at the EU level. The Commission is also working on two European contingency regulations to ensure the interests of our citizens and companies. The first priority is for the transport of goods and the other for the transport of passengers. In maritime transport, we find ourselves in the most globalized and internationalized sector, and in this case, the Commission is also dealing with contingency regulations in which we work to adequately capture the interests of Spain. In terms of ports, Brexit will result in an increase in controls and inspections of goods. In order to carry out these controls and inspections, the provision of the Border Goods Control Facilities are necessary.  </p><h4>What are the ministry's priorities for the coming months?</h4><p>For the ministry, one of the main priorities is to guarantee the right to housing, promoting the use of social rental housing, mobilizing public land that is available through the transfer of surface rights and favoring the use of public-private mechanisms. Another fundamental priority is to carry out a new concept of mobility and inclusive transport, oriented to the user, and offering adapted mobility solutions for all; including integrated transport, where all the means are synchronized, and sustainable in economic, environmental and social terms. We must adopt a more advanced vision in the infrastructure policy, thinking more about the mobility it offers to the citizen, than in the construction of new infrastructures. In this sense, we are already working on the Safe, Sustainable and Connected Mobility Strategy. We will also work on the Sustainable Mobility Law to guarantee the right to mobility of all citizens, taking into account the challenge of climate change and the possibilities offered by digitalization. To this end, we will increase public investment in security and maintenance of infrastructure, favoring the gradual preparation for sustainable mobility. That includes the needs derived from electrification and digitalization, with the aim of increasing the number of passengers in this means of transport by 30% for 2025. In addition, we want to promote a state pact on infrastructure, which, among other things, would guarantee compliance with the high-speed railway plans currently under execution, as well as investment in commuter trains and other relevant actions, such as the Mediterranean Corridor, or the Atlantic Corridor. Finally, it is necessary to increase investment in security and maintenance, as well as actions to reduce pollution and the environmental impact of roads, railways, port, and airport infrastructure.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the key achievements of JFDZ over the last year?</h4><p>2018 gave Jordan's free and development zones an enhanced and future-oriented outlook. One of our main achievements was the completion of the infrastructure of the new Airport Free Zone in preparation for its official launch in early 2019. Moreover, JFDZ won a global bid to host the Middle East Regional Office for the World Free Zones Organization with a view to promote world free zones best practices. Looking at development zones, we also finalized the necessary infrastructure to launch the Dead Sea Corniche in 2019. This is a dynamic mixed-use neighborhood of hotels, residences, shops, restaurants, and public open spaces at the northern Dead Sea shore. Meanwhile, the Ajloun Teleferik bid was launched in 2018 to be implemented in 2019. Both the Dead Sea Corniche and Ajloun Teleferik are expected to enhance the tourism experience, attract local and foreign visitors and investors, and provide job opportunities for local communities. The occupancy rate of public free zones—Zarqa, Sahab, Mowaqa, Airport, Kerak, and Karamah—registered an average of 84%. In 2017, public free zone imports totaled USD3.52 billion, while exports registered USD3.94 billion for a total trade volume of USD7.47 billion. The total amount of investment in the 37 registered private free zones reached USD977 million, of which USD458 million, or nearly 47%, was Jordanian investments, while the total trade of private free zones registered USD1.83 billion. As for the development zones, JFDZ attracts a wide spectrum of Jordanian, regional, and international investors. The value of investments based on the signed development agreements for developing the Dead Sea Development Zone reached JOD1 billion, providing around 6,000 hotel rooms and no less than 7,500 direct job opportunities in the coming five years.</p><h4>What is the strategic importance of the new free zone at Queen Alia International Airport?</h4><p>It ties into the government's plans to enhance the investment climate in Jordan by providing a full package of logistics and re-export facilities. The newly established free zone covers 1 million sqm of developed land, offering world-class infrastructure and a lucrative business environment with administrative and logistics support services. The Airport Free Zone enjoys a vital location, given Jordan's strategic positioning in the heart of the Middle East and the zone's direct access to air cargo services and easy access to major road connections. The Queen Alia International Airport Free Zone's competitive advantage lies in being a logistics hub for import and re-exports by offering streamlined business operating environment for investors and business owners, as well as providing fiscal and financial incentives, electronic services for transactions, and top-notch free zone facilities and infrastructure networks. Additionally, the zone will provide unparalleled access to regional and international markets. </p><h4>What are the targeted investment activities and sectors for the new Airport Free Zone?</h4><p>These include logistic and refrigerated storage, medicines and medical supplies, consumables, precious materials, and heavy goods (timber and spare parts and plastic products) for the commercial sector. As a result, the targeted industrial investments will include chemical industries, food, beverage and tobacco, wood industry, machinery and electrical equipment industry, and the precious materials industry. In terms of markets, the current investment interests are diversified, from the Middle East and GCC to the US, Europe, India, and China. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[turning-challenges-into-opportunities]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>How do Optimiza and IrisGuard, Kawar Groups' flagship developments in the ICT sector, contribute to the group's portfolio?<br>Optimiza is result of a nine-way merger, and this was the group's effort to not only consolidate some of its activities but also merge with like-minded companies to build, scale, and export products and services to the region. This has worked extremely well for the group, making Optimiza one of the few publicly traded ICT companies on the Amman Stock Exchange. With over 35 years of history, it has the reputation and experience to take on large projects inside and outside of Jordan. IrisGuard is also a stellar company. Its latest product is a phone that is manufactured specifically for IrisGuard. The phone has an Iris-scanning camera on the front and back, with no password or security. We have developed with Iris recognition a demo app that can scan my iris and find me from that database. A scan will be taken of my eye and sent to a demo database in the UK. The app found my picture and my information out of over 2 million irises in just over five seconds.</p><h4>How is Kawar applying this innovative technology?</h4><p>We are now using IrisGuard to focus on increasing financial inclusion. UNHCR is registering Syrian refugees through IrisGuard to avoid duplication. Once registered, UNHCR can provide services using cashless systems. Refugees can go to ATM machines and look into the camera, which opens up a special screen using which refugees can access their assistance. It is extremely accurate, and we have processed over USD600 million with no questionable transaction. We have worked with WFP to extend this technology to supermarkets, so that refugees can purchase their food items by scanning their irises. By giving refugees cash, we empower them to make choices and we support the local merchants. IrisGuard encourages financial inclusion so that refugees can have a financial history through blockchain. IrisGuard has been a win-win for everyone, and working with donor agencies has allowed it to stretch the assistance dollars to help more clients.</p><h4>What is the potential for Jordan to become a digital, knowledge-based economy, and where does Kawar Group fit into this equation?</h4><p>I was the architect of the REACH2025 initiative, which is building Jordan as a digital economy. First introduced in 2000, Jordan has come a long way in the ICT sector. Jordanians are increasingly using their smart devices to interact, whether it is with our banks or our government, which brings greater efficiency. Certainly, a great deal of that can utilize blockchain in terms of tokenization, making assets more accessible for potential buyers. That can cut across many industries, for example, in agriculture, blockchain can track produce from the farm to the dining table. Many stakeholders are exploring how to use blockchain to fix that, which can go a long way in enhancing our exports.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about NatHealth?</h4><p>NatHealth, a national health insurance administration, is another company in our group, and we are its third-party administrator (TPA). It's a 22-year-old company that works with insurance companies and self-insured funds that outsource the administration and the adjudication of its medical claims to us. We sit in between the healthcare providers and the payers, be they insurance companies or self-insured funds. Recently we set up NatHealth Palestine, which is now in its fifth year and fairly successful. We seek to take this company regionally to replicate this success in other markets. Jordan has great opportunities and can be well positioned to receive those investments, whether in logistics, ICT, energy, tourism, or healthcare—key sectors that are promising for Jordan and the region. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the state of the knowledge economy in Jordan?</h4><p>There is an urgent need to transform Jordan into a knowledge economy. Jordanians like to take the US and the UK as role models, but I always compare Jordan to Finland because both have more in common. Both countries have a small population and no natural resources. However, Finland's GDP is over USD230 billion, whereas Jordan's is USD40 billion. There is no reason Jordan cannot reach a GDP level comparable to that of Finland's; we just need the political will and corresponding political decisions. Unfortunately, most governments address short-term issues. In comparison, Finland has decided to address long-term issues and invented the tools to become a knowledge economy. Finland is leading changes in education globally, and adopting its model is the short and long road to success. This is why I established the Talal Abu Ghazaleh Knowledge Forum, which has set a target for Jordan to reach USD280-billion GDP by 2040. We have problems in the economy, including the closure of borders, which has turned Jordan into an economic prison. In the absence of that, the only approach is to go digital, because the digital economy has no borders. However, we have not yet captured the enabling power of the digital economy. IT is a tool, and the knowledge economy is the implementation of that tool for everything in our life. AI is already a dominant technology globally and it will become even more popular. Our intellectual property organization became the global leader for intellectual property protection because we captured the enabling power of ICT. </p><h4>How does the situation in Jordan fit into a broader global context?</h4><p>I have issued a warning that we are heading for a major global crisis and possibly a war in 2020. Tensions between the US and China are growing rapidly, which is similar to what was predicted during a seminar I attended at the National Science Academy in Washington DC in 1985. The US' objective is not to occupy, invade, or destroy China, but to force China to sit in a bilateral meeting to develop a new world order. As a result of this, a global Marshall Plan will emerge that will place this region at the center of the global renaissance, foremost because this area is in the direst need of reconstruction. Second, the region has the financial resources, which will serve the financial interest of the powers involved. If the issues between the US and China are dealt with, we will see great potential for humanity. Another critical piece of the global context is climate change. Over time, climate change has grown into one of the biggest threats to humans; even the US congress is discussing about an existential threat in 12 years. The issue of climate change can be solved with the advent of AI. There are 8,000 AI scientists in the US and 6,000 in Russia, and the solution is to put a team together as AI makes it possible to convert pollutants into non-polluting products in one year. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the King Hussein Foundation's innovative and evolving approach to socio-economic development translated into successes for the country?</h4><p>The King Hussein Foundation was created to give an enduring life to King Hussein's humanitarian vision and legacy. We do that by focusing on equitable access to socioeconomic opportunity including health, education, microfinance, and cross-cultural programming, with an emphasis on women, youth, and marginalized groups in particular. The King Hussein Foundation was built, in part, on the sustainable development initiatives of the Noor Al Hussein Foundation going back nearly 40 years, and today includes eight institutions: the Jordan Micro Credit Company (Tamweelcom), Ethmar for Islamic Microfinance, the Institute for Family Health, the Community Development Program, the Jubilee Institute, the Information and Research Center, the National Center for Culture and Performing Arts, and the National Music Conservatory. All of these entities are characterized by a multidisciplinary approach to address challenges with an inclusive development methodology.</p><h4>Can you elaborate more on the King Hussein Foundation's two microfinance companies, Tamweelcom and Ethmar?</h4><p>The seeds of the microfinance companies began with the revolving funds in the community projects we started in the early 1980s. Most of those original funds are still active and providing support to their communities. We now have a total of 150 revolving loan funds around the country. Tamweelcom, established in 1999, is one of the foundation's significant success stories. It is a leading not-for-profit microfinance company in Jordan and the region, serving more than 90,000 clients, integrating low income and productive communities into the mainstream economy, and closing the unemployment gap. Tamweelcom's mission has also evolved with the growing needs of local communities ranging from responsible finance to broad-based projects including green energy, home improvement, technology innovation and others. Our sensitivity to the evolving needs of the market has also prompted Tamweelcom to introduce digital financial services to entrepreneurs in order to provide responsive and responsible credit at all times, wherever they may be located. Ethmar, which is three years old, addressed the gap for services for people hesitant to take advantage of any kind of loan structure that is not sharia compliant. Ethmar has built an efficient micro finance model through diverse network of vendors and the utilization of technology and was awarded the 2018 Global Islamic Micro Forum Award for developing a financial tracking system for Islamic compliant loans. Again, both companies have also introduced holistic approaches to the field with an array of non-financial services and support to clients, including educational support, mobile banking services, and health insurance.</p><h4>What initiatives are you putting into place today to ensure that people are ready for the way the economy is developing?</h4><p>The King Hussein Foundation's programs are focused on levelling the playing field for our youth socially, educationally and economically. 50% of Tamweelcom's clients are under the age of 35. Our Community Development Program, for example, is integrating efforts with our two microfinance companies, to provide business training and incubation, reaching into different regions. In expanding our work in the south, we have a program focused on women in micro- and small enterprises. This program is designed to address women and girls' social, educational and financial needs, including business incubation. In addition to our specialized economic development programs, the mission of the Jubilee Institute, our primary education thrust, which includes the Jubilee School, is to maximize access to state-of-art education, curriculum development and training opportunities for public and private school teachers and scholarship students from diverse backgrounds to enable them to thrive in our rapidly changing world. We are also trying to mainstream gender in every aspect including national advocacy efforts through our Information and Research Center, which was founded to assist practitioners and decision makers to develop evidence based and effective socio-economic policies. King Hussein's approach to leadership and his public service stemmed from his most deeply held personal values. He sought to translate his humility, faith in his fellow man, and deep and abiding humanism into systems of governance that promoted human dignity, equitable opportunity, and justice. Our mission will continue to be to give enduring life to those commitments. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does Jordan's new Investment Window streamline the processes for the registration and licensing of investment projects? </h4><p>The Investment Window at JIC, or the one-stop window, is one of the most important means of empowering local and foreign investments by simplifying registration and licensing procedures for investment projects that benefit from the Investment Law. The Investment Window includes authorized representatives of the concerned government authorities who have the authority to issue approvals and licenses for investment projects, as well as qualified staff from the commission for procedure facilitation and follow-up. The services provided by the Investment Window include: providing information and technical advice to investors, registering companies and sole proprietorships within and outside the development zones, and issuing of licenses and approvals necessary for conducting business as well as issuing licenses for economic activities within development zones. The objectives of the Investment Window include: enhancing confidence in Jordan's investment environment by providing data, information, and facilities for the establishment of investment projects; streamlining procedures and decreasing the time required to issue required approvals and licenses for investment projects; and contribute to strengthening the status of local and foreign investments through diligent follow-up and support.</p><h4>How will developments in e-government services influence the investment climate?</h4><p>There is a growing recognition of the role that e-government has in promoting Jordan's attractiveness to foreign investors and improving investment climate. Therefore, the government is deploying e-government services as a promotion technique that helps to eliminate FDI barriers, in particular, those related to information retrieval and accessibility, business procedures, and bureaucratic protocols facing investors. </p><h4>How does JIC ensure that investment reaches all governorates?</h4><p>Jordan provides a comprehensive range of incentives and facilitation services to potential investors. The Jordanian government has undertaken numerous serious measures to review and enhance the economic and financial legal frameworks governing the investment process to take advantage of available opportunities to increase economic growth and promote development in the various governorates of the Kingdom. In addition to the income tax reduction regime in less-developed governorates, the investment map, which aligns with the Jordan 2025 vision, has analyzed the existing socioeconomic situation, investment environment, current and latent potentials, competitive characteristics, and strategic and development orientation of all governorates. The investment map identifies a number of medium- and small-scale investments in different economic sectors that have higher growth opportunities and labor-intensive qualities, complying with the competitive characteristics of different governorates, considering their visions and developmental strategies.</p><h4>What are the most important investment opportunities or projects JIC is currently promoting, and what are the key value-added sectors?</h4><p>JIC aims to provide an attractive investment environment for its value-added economic sectors. Based on the competitive advantage of Jordan in the region and through the analysis of investment opportunities and promotional strategies, the aim is to promote investment and Jordanian exports in promising sectors. The primary sectors of the economy that JIC focuses on are industrial, logistics, ICT, energy and renewable energy, water, transportation, tourism, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, and agriculture. The development zones and free zones throughout the Kingdom provide all the needed infrastructure and services for investors to support their investment requirements in the aforementioned sectors.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on the Kingdom's main advantages as an investment environment? </h4><p>Jordan is well known for its skilled and highly educated human capital. Jordan ranks fourth overall in the MENA region in terms of talent competitiveness according to the 2018 Global Talent Competitiveness Index. Jordan's strong performance in this index points to the country's continuous efforts to develop its most valued resource. Labor costs in Jordan remain among the most competitive in the region, and with its large pool of high-caliber intellectual and professional expertise, Jordan is a major supplier of brainpower to neighboring countries. With such human capital, investors will have the necessary resources to ensure high-quality performance, which will reflect on their competitiveness and increase their ROI. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Nearly five years after enacting Investment Law No. 30, what are the biggest impacts on the investment environment in Jordan?</h4><p>Investment Law No. 30 was passed in 2014 to attract foreign investment and stimulate local investments. Compared to other investment laws in the region, it is a competitive legislative framework, offering a range of incentives and benefits in and outside the free zones. Jordan is largely open to foreign investment, and foreign and local investors are treated equally under the law. JIC is responsible for promoting new and existing investment in Jordan, including through simplifying investment procedures. The economic reforms in Jordan have led to the creation of a competitive investment environment and strengthening of the national economy. These reforms will be key to addressing investors' obstacles and making Jordan an attractive location for value-added investments.</p><h4>Looking at export markets, what are the economic opportunities for Jordan?</h4><p>The government is keen to integrate the Jordanian economy into the global market by liberalizing trade and benefiting from global trade and investment opportunities. These policies have led to the creation of a network of trade relations between Jordan, the region, and beyond, as well as large economic blocs, allowing increased market access for Jordanian products. JIC is working to find new markets to promote Jordanian products in East Africa and Central Asia, boosting national exports to an even greater extent as borders with Iraq and Syria slowly reopen. With the availability of regular, secure maritime routes, African markets are eager to import Jordanian industrial products.</p><h4>We spoke with Airport International Group on its success story in terms of attracting private investment. What is the significance of this example for investment in Jordan?</h4><p>Success is contagious, and success stories are critical for attracting further FDI. Though we signed the PPP for Queen Alia International Airport in 2007, the true success has been in the project's ability to deliver real results. The airport has the capacity to handle demand and long-term growth; it can manage 12 million passengers and serves as a regional hub with better facilities and services that meet international best practices. The airport contributes to tourism and business, thereby supporting economic growth. Jordan aims to replicate such PPP successes and offers PPP investment opportunities, driving economic growth and employment through well-defined partnerships in infrastructure, utilities, and service sectors.</p><h4>After gaining significant ground in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business ranking over the last two years, how will Jordan continue this trajectory?</h4><p>After moving up 14 spots in the last two years, we aim for even more improvement. Looking deeper into the report, we can still see areas in which we need to progress, including ease of getting credit, protecting minority investors, resolving insolvency, and dealing with construction permits. We have seen advancement in some of these areas; Jordan's rank in getting credit stands at 134th out of 190 compared to 159th the year before. However, we are still weak in areas such as depth of credit information, credit registry coverage, and credit bureau coverage. Jordan has improved its credit information system by setting up a regulatory framework for establishing a private credit bureau and lowered the threshold for loans to be reported to the public credit registry. In addition, in 2018, Jordan improved access to credit information by establishing a new credit bureau, but we are looking for more enhancements in this sub indicator. We are focusing on indicators related to starting businesses, paying taxes, obtaining building permits, registering property, taking out loans, protecting minority investors, enforcing contracts, and securing an electricity connection, which reflects on saving time and money and initiates gradual improvement. These efforts are in cooperation with the World Bank Group and we are utilizing its global expertise to reach our targets. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>We live in a world of commerce and industry. And as part of humanity, we are all in agreement that we want to live in a world that is peaceful. We want food and clean water for everyone and an environment that can sustainably support all of the earth's inhabitants. All of these things are aspirations that no individual or nation can claim exclusively. We have to work as a team. We have to reach out to people for better understanding. The connectivity that is desired for commerce and work includes human resources. Whether citizens or not, all members of the labor force deserve the same protection and the same degree of treatment as a human beings.</p><p>We have two labor agreements that will enhance the standards of protection for Filipinos employed as household service workers in Jordan and regulate labor deployment, exchanges, and communication and further studies on labor. As I have repeatedly said, our government will continue to do its part to ensure that the rights of our nationals working abroad are protected, enhanced, and upheld.</p><p>We have also concluded a number of government-to-government and business-to-business sector agreements. Investments generated are valued at over USD140 million and expected to generate over 1,200 new jobs. This, we believe, is only the beginning. Together with HM King Abdullah's Cabinet, we are discussing ways to expand cooperation in two-way trade and investment, human resource development, interfaith dialog, tourism, and other areas of governance. Trade and other similar missions will be launched to give greater impetus to these efforts.</p><p>My country is relatively young. We gained our independence from the Spaniards and then Americans, who ruled us for 400 years and 50 years, respectively. We were colonized for so long that along the way, we lost our identity as a race belonging to the Malay. What is true in Asia is true here in the Middle East. Nevertheless, we move on and continue to build our nations for generations to come. I was mayor of my city for more than 22 years, and I was a member of Congress and a vice mayor. By the time I complete my presidency, I will have served my country for 40 years. Our similar histories make Jordan and the Philippines compelling business partners, and I see many opportunities for increasing economic and investment ties. We are peaceful nations with talented manpower.</p><p>There are several opportunities for foreign investors in the Philippines as we have a large population with growing demand for goods and services. Moreover, much like Jordan, we are increasing the ease of doing business. As we reaffirm the Philippines' position in maintaining and promoting peace and stability in the region and pursue our independent foreign policy, we are showing that the Philippines is, indeed, a friend to all and an enemy to no one. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the most recent updates regarding the Nuqul Group's aggressive growth strategy?</h4><p>In 2015, the idea was to have a five-year business plan with specific KPIs and milestones for accelerating growth and achieving the business plan on a larger scale. In May 2015, we increased our capital by bringing in investors, namely Standard Chartered Private Equity. The idea is to be IPO ready. Whether we have an IPO in the end, merge with a conglomerate, or buy a number of players in the region, there will be some sort of an exit at least for the private equity team. What has happened in the industry and region has caught everybody by surprise. Pulp prices went up for 18 months in a row to historical highs, and prices of finished products went down. That was coupled with the removal of subsidies in some markets in the Gulf, which also weakened purchasing power. </p><h4>What innovations and product solutions are part of your comprehensive strategy?</h4><p>The first step is de-commoditizing tissue. We are coming up with interesting propositions for different types of consumers whereby we not only compete on price, but also on value, features, and enhanced customer satisfaction. We have already identified certain products within the tissue business. One example is Dueto, which we are testing in Egypt. All options of toilet paper include the hollow cardboard core inside, which means consumers at all stages pay for the air inside. We removed this core and inserted an extra small wrapped roll. This innovation is creative and disruptive and is one example of how we are innovating within our existing business segments.</p><h4>What role do technology and e-commerce play in this disruption?</h4><p>Technology has two main facets. One is e-commerce, with online B2B and B2C, and we are the first to launch an online B2B store. All hospitals and hotels can actually book online and are connected to our ERP system. The other element of e-commerce is integrating with souq.com, Amazon, and other platforms. Another facet is our department for digital transformation, which is separate from the IT department and is in charge of these developments in addition to internal developments. We aim to connect our fleets with smart solutions, allowing us to control driving habits, savings, and route optimization. We are also starting to work with AI to improve our in-store availability and shelf location, monitor consumer habits, and use analytics. We are at the forefront of technology as technology is the platform and the tool that will enable us to move forward, both in terms of disruption and expansion.</p><h4>What are your key markets for exports?</h4><p>We export raw materials and finished products to more than 70 countries. For target markets for expansion, Africa as a whole would definitely be one; there is also Pakistan and India. India and Pakistan are new markets for us in terms of finished products that we are looking at in addition to the markets we penetrated in 2018 such as Europe, the US, and others. </p><h4>What are the current opportunities in Jordan?</h4><p>There are great opportunities. What we need is an enabling environment; however, the fact that a businessman can see five ministers in one week in Jordan tells you that the government is willing to listen. We certainly need an economic plan with milestones, KPIs, timeframe, and accountability. Second, this plan should be trans-governance so no government can change it. Third, we need a major mindset transformation, from a government that looks at collecting taxes to a government that stimulates growth. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>In 2017, I was delighted to visit Jordan not once, but twice. And it was there in Amman that I and the King agreed on a new ambitious partnership for the long-term benefit of both our countries. Today we have built on that partnership through our new initiative, the London Initiative.</p><p>This initiative backs Jordan's Vision 2025 and supports Jordan in delivering social and economic reforms that will transform its economy, making the most of its young, talented, and diverse workforce—and, crucially, actively encouraging the participation of its women. That vision is already becoming a reality. Today has demonstrated how much has been achieved and how Jordan's reform program is already making a difference. Earlier, I heard from HM King Abdullah II about his own personal commitment to supporting Jordan's government to drive forward these reforms.</p><p>There remain complex and long-term regional and economic challenges. But Jordan has a robust and realistic strategy to bring about change. Coming together today provides us with the opportunity to shore up and transform Jordan's economy, working together to tackle instability, and create an attractive environment for investment with benefits beyond Jordan. That is why it has been so good to see governments, CEOs, and investors backing this new approach to support Jordan, matching confidence with commitments that will help unlock growth, jobs and investment. Unlocking this potential to enable Jordan to prosper and remain a beacon of stability matters to all of us.</p><p>Jordan sits at the center of a region that has faced turbulence and uncertainty over the last decade; the political upheaval in 2010 and 2011, emergence of Daesh, and ongoing conflict in Syria have changed the face of the Middle East. The people of Jordan have demonstrated resilience in the face of these challenges. Despite having their traditional trade relationships severed, energy challenges intensified, they have given shelter and support to more than 650,000 refugees from various regional conflicts. All the while, Jordan has been steadfast in the fight against terrorism and pursuing peace and promoting stability in the Middle East. For decades, Jordan and the UK have stood side by side on these and other issues.<br>So we must be clear: a stable Jordan defends us from terrorist groups taking root and strengthens the border security of neighboring countries. And that is why our collective support for Jordan is so crucial. Jordan is an old and cherished friend of the UK. At the heart of our long-term partnership is a broad and deep commitment to tackling common challenges.<br>The UK is at the center of coordinating the assistance that will help lay the foundations for a strong and prosperous future for Jordan. Key to this is the role played by the IMF and the World Bank. But we have to remember that the private sector will be the key to catalyzing Jordan's economic transformation. As governments, we can create the frameworks and environments that foster economic growth, but private investment is what will make the real difference. To demonstrate the extent of the UK's own confidence in Jordan and our determination to make the vision of Jordan's Prime Minister and King a reality, I am pleased that the UK will be underwriting a USD250-million World Bank loan to Jordan. This will come alongside a substantial uplift in our grant financing over the next five years. This will open the door to reinvigorating Jordan's economy, attracting the investment needed to stimulate growth and create jobs.</p><p>Jordan shows us what a modern, reforming, and innovative Middle Eastern state can look like. But it is important now that we maintain momentum. We have an opportunity—and a way forward—to support Jordan and it is crucial that we all pull together to form a global coalition to back Jordan for the future. A future in which Jordan and the international community can bring about lasting change. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>There was a recent archaeological discovery in northeastern Jordan, where the world's oldest piece of bread was found in a stone fireplace, dating back to a 14,500-year-old settlement, 4,000 years before the agricultural era began to take hold. These oldest-known remnants of bread left by our ancestors represent the kind of innovation and determination that we have preserved to this day, and as Jordanians, we have shared and continue to share our bread with others. These traits have become embedded in Jordan's DNA.</p><p>Although we have faced a difficult period, we are at one of the most promising, pivotal points of our history as well. Jordan lives in a tough neighborhood, but what Jordan has chosen to do with its geopolitical circumstances has been a matter of sheer will and determination. In this complex and turbulent region, we have chosen to stick by the simple ethos of 'do well by doing good' for ourselves and for others.</p><p>Jordan received 1.3 million Syrians in less than five years. The impact on our infrastructure and economy was tremendous. According to World Bank estimates, our open door policy toward Syrians cost Jordan USD2.5 billion per year. In 2016, HM King Abdullah II warned that Jordan had reached a boiling point. Gratefully, some aid and support did come from the international community, and in its characteristically resolute, inventive, and constructive way, Jordan managed to stabilize the situation.<br>It is now the time for all of us to move forward from crisis management to growth and prosperity realization by working together with old friends and new partners to do good and do well. First and foremost, Jordan's immediate focus is to stimulate economic growth in order to provide greater opportunities to Jordanians.</p><p>Moving forward on this mandate has required a number of tough and swift actions related to macroeconomic stability, stimulation of economic growth, reduction in the cost of energy, and capitalization on our tremendous human capital potential. Since coming to office, my government has worked with parliament to introduce a fairly stringent set of measures, including the elimination of certain subsidies, reduction in public expenditures, and the introduction of a new income tax law that fortifies the country's fiscal foundations. In parallel, the government launched its priority action plan centered on three main pillars: to strengthen the rule of law and governance; provide better public services; and propel economic growth, productivity, and job creation.</p><p>Within this guiding framework, between January 2018 and February 2019, we undertook scores of key reforms, from making sure procurement processes are more efficient and transparent to strengthening Jordan public officials' financial disclosure requirements and introducing bold new labor laws designed to encourage women's participation in the workforce. <br>Jordan understands that its path to sustainable and equitable economic growth includes aggressively increasing exports and FDI and enhancing its operational competitiveness. For this, we have developed a Five-Year Reform and Growth Matrix, which combines short-and medium-term actions for a realistic economic transformation. This matrix is devised to create not just jobs, but also an enabling economic environment for the advancement of Jordan's educated, skilled, and motivated population—especially women and youth—in already leading fields such as business services, technology, healthcare, engineering, tourism, and logistics.</p><p>A valuable tool for investors that we have developed in cooperation with our international partners is the Project Pipeline Development Facility, geared toward preparing PPP projects that attract investments in key sectors such as water, health, ICT, tourism, waste management, and transport.</p><p>As an example and model to replicate, we have a proven track record in the promising and barely tapped energy sector. Frequent energy supply disruptions from regional sources taught us the importance of energy diversification and self-reliance. By utilizing our abundant supply of renewable energy, Jordan is well positioned to take advantage of a future full of emerging opportunities. Indeed, targeted investments in Jordan's energy sector is setting in motion a virtuous cycle in the national economy, bringing down production costs, greening the economy, and allowing businesses to become more competitive. Many other sectors have the same dynamic potential. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[The Dawn of a New Era]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[the-dawn-of-a-new-era]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>The world understands the importance of a strong and prosperous Jordan. And I would particularly like to thank my fellow Jordanians. It is solely because of their resilience and capability that our country has been able to stand strong in the face of external storms. That same resilience and capability is the source of the opportunities that lie ahead. Young Jordanians, especially, have a leading role.<br>We are focusing in detail on Jordan's economic opportunities. So, let me say just a few words about the importance of this work. </p><p>There is no question that the past years have been exceptionally challenging. Jordan's commitment to reform was showing success when we, like many others, were hit by the global financial crisis and multiple shocks to global energy prices and sources. Regional turmoil then disrupted key trade routes and energy flows. And our situation worsened with the Syrian refugee crisis—a global burden that global assistance has not adequately shared, despite some of the very committed international partners that we have. </p><p>Yet throughout these challenges, Jordan remained secure, strong, and a centerpiece for the values that our world depends on—mutual respect, moderation, steady determination, and the dignity of all. We have held out our hands in compassion to desperate refugees, as we have always done. And we have taken difficult, responsible action to tackle the tremendous economic and budgetary strains. But slow growth cannot take us to the future that we know is possible. It cannot give us the jobs and better lives that my people expect and deserve, especially after so much sacrifice. And supporting our people supports Jordan's positive international role as a durable force for peace, for interfaith harmony, and for positive development in the region and in the world.</p><p>So, Jordan took a good hard look at its economic agenda, and the result is clear—we need to strategically refocus on our competitive advantages. In the spotlight, first and foremost, is our powerhouse of talented, aspiring young people. Second is our central geostrategic position, connecting continents and markets. And third is Jordan's respected international role, which stands behind our established trade relationships and numerous free trade agreements.<br>As you will hear today, our economic strategy prioritizes service sectors that benefit directly from Jordan's high-value human capital. Now these sectors are ripe for growth, provide the better-paying jobs that can meet the pressing needs of Jordanians, and take advantage of our many trade agreements, which give Jordan-based businesses access to 1 billion customers around the world. We are also aggressively shifting toward green energy by leveraging Jordan's advantages in solar and wind. By 2020, we expect one-fifth of our energy will be generated through renewables. All of this boosts economic activity and jobs.<br>Our country has already embarked on more reforms to foster a healthy business climate. And we are actively working with the international community to ensure the fiscal space that is needed for economic growth. Access to concessional financing is essential.</p><p>Now our strategy covers five years to permit predictability and sustainability. But we are not waiting for events to unroll by themselves. We have several ready-to-invest opportunities streamed by our Project Pipeline, a Jordan-led effort in partnership with the IFC to develop bankable opportunities with the legal and financial structuring that investors expect.<br>This is just the beginning of a new program of transformative economic growth for Jordan, and the benefits of supporting this process run deep. When global economic players support people who are doing the right thing, when you grow opportunity, when you respect the hopes of a new generation, and when you help youth shape a positive future, you build a platform for a healthy, stable, and ethical global economy on which everyone's future depends.</p><p>I am speaking as an advocate for Jordan. In the last 20 years, no one has seen more of my people's strength and resilience. No one has listened harder to our families and seen their steadfast labor, generosity, and determination. No one has flown over more of our amazing landscape or seen more of its diversity up close.</p><p>I have watched our cities begin the vital work of renewal, with brilliant urban regeneration projects like Abdali in Amman. I have seen solar power and wind farms open the door to green energy solutions. And I have been to our five UNESCO World Heritage Sites, beacons of regional and global tourism. I have seen our fertile green farms and our blue-water seaport. And I have met with thousands of young Jordanians at work for our future—bilingual computer programmers who have led the region in communications and Arabic internet content; young businesswomen and businessmen building domestic, regional, and global markets; young scientists leading the way at the Middle East's first particle accelerator; and many other young leaders and innovators. They are ready for new opportunities.</p><p>The fact is if you have not been to Jordan recently, you have not been in Jordan. I want to invite all of you to visit and join us in an exciting future. <br></p><p>Economic leadership is by definition forward-looking. And forward-looking engagement will send a powerful message, a message of hope for my people and for yours. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-major-milestone]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main accomplishments for Dolla Financial Services?</h4><p>Dolla Financial started operations in October 2014, offering remittance services through Moneygram, other services such as bill payments, check cashing, and some loans and financing. In September 2016, Dolla Financial Services did its first acquisition of M24 Investments, a microfinance company. That was a major milestone because the company attained its first microfinance loan portfolio and based on that, our loan book of JMD2 million jumped to over JMD100 million in less than two years. Since our last acquisition, we have disbursed over JMD400 million in loans to the microfinance sector. Notably, we have done many fundraising activities, demonstrating investors' confidence in the company. Similarly, we have done private placements, exempt distributions, and raised funds through our broker of stocks and securities. In the first fundraiser, we raised JMD35 million, and we are currently in the market to raise up to JMD250 million through a private placement registered with the Financial Services Commission. Furthermore, we are now incorporated in Guyana and seek to start operations there in 2019. In the future, we are looking to expand to Haiti, Barbados, and Cayman and giving each Jamaican the opportunity to own a part of the company through an IPO.</p><h4>How is the company committed to implementing growth strategies?</h4><p>For Jamaica, we plan to grow through acquisitions, prudently acquiring other microfinance institutions and their portfolios, and covering a greater mass of the market. We also focus on organic growth, and we will expand from eight branches to 15-16 by early 2019. Moreover, we will reach customers in rural areas to give them access to financing. This will give us a significant advantage and solidify our purpose to provide to those susceptible to poverty. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe 2018 financially for the JSE?</h4>
<p>We have experienced growth, but it is not sufficient. The unemployment rate has fallen significantly, and we should now look at moving toward full employment and ensuring that those who are employed are in meaningful employment. Jamaica's economy is poised for the world; there is value to be had in doing business in Jamaica, and moving toward 2019, we will see solid growth.</p>
<h4>How easy is it for SMEs and small investors to access the stock exchange?</h4>
<p>With respect to small businesses, in 2009 we saw a need to look at SMEs and enable them to gain access to capital. As a result, we started the junior market, which has allowed over 38 companies to access capital. We also entered into partnerships with the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and IMF to approach SMEs; we help them with certain competencies, such as the development of a business plan, resource management, team development, and so on. Moreover, the government has been supportive in terms of tax concessions, allowing companies to operate with zero tax for the first five years and 50% of the prevailing rate for the next five years. This same model can be replicated for the micro market, and we have had dialogue with the government on this.</p>
<h4>What are the reasons behind the strong increase in quarterly profits?</h4>
<p>The economy is doing well; there is more money to be invested, and the interest rate has fallen, so the key thing is to look at the stock market for real returns in investment. The stock market is also seen as a safe, efficient, and transparent market, as the regulatory framework is tight, effective, and efficient. Our profits have also increased due to our diversification efforts. We have strategically looked at all the areas that would be necessary if the economy and financial sector grows; hence, we can provide what we call the back-end service. Companies can focus on their deals, and we will do their paperwork, which is what we will do as we expand with every financial transaction that comes through the pipeline.</p>
<h4>What opportunities does the high liquidity of the Jamaican dollar bring?</h4>
<p>More products and services are being developed, and people are being innovative. Recently, we have had significantly more listings, and the sectors that they come from are more varied and interesting. When we look at the stock exchange, the companies initially coming to market to raise capital were mostly financial and insurance companies; however, at present, we see companies mopping up the liquidity across several industries. For example, for the first time we had a listing in the health sector, partly because there is great potential in medical tourism.</p>
<h4>What is your perspective on the green economy?</h4>
<p>The listing of Wigton Windfarm excites us because the green economy is an area where government divestment programs should be through an exchange that offers a transparent process and allows Jamaican ownership; it is important that we engage our own people in terms of investment. The JSE will look at how to introduce a green market by 2020, so that people who operate in the green space, namely investors in green bonds, will look at investing in Jamaica. I see this more from a standpoint of a capital inflow to Jamaica, because while the green economy is still nascent, there is a greater international consciousness about the green space.</p>
<h4>What are your goals and strategy for 2019?</h4>
<p>We will soon launch a bureau to look at collective investment schemes. In 2019, we will launch the JSE Social Stock Exchange, which is part of our CSR program. We are also keen to look at areas of disruption in the financial sector and fintech, such as blockchain and will embrace this gradually, study it, and collaborate with entities such as the Development Bank of Jamaica and IDB. We are currently piloting a digital platform that will be rolled out in 2019.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[financial-inclusion]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the main accomplishments and challenges for First Global Bank over the last year?</h4>
<p>In the last 12 months, there have been many developments. We are proud of our deliberate strategic focus to drive financial inclusion as a key strategic imperative of the government. We had in fact envisioned this even before. It is always a great thing when the national priority syncs with a company's corporate strategy. Up to 30% of Jamaicans are currently under or unbanked, which prevents them from conducting transactions or taking credit. We provide our services across eight branches in urban areas across Jamaica: Mandeville, Ocho Rios, Montego Bay, and Kingston. However, a number of Jamaicans live outside the urban areas, so we reach out to communities through our brand, First Global Money Link, by serving them in two ways: mini-branch models and agency banking. We put our kiosks in an existing business, and that kiosk functions as our mini branch.</p>
<h4>What does this agent banking represent for both the bank and GraceKennedy Group?</h4>
<p>GraceKennedy Group is pursuing financial inclusion more broadly; it is a 96-year-old company, and a major portion of its growth comes from this country. We are headquartered here, though GraceKennedy is a global company, and the bank is its subsidiary. The financial group is pursuing financial inclusion, and we are doing this through our brand called GK One. We want to be a one-stop shop for all Jamaicans.</p>
<h4>How do you maximize awareness of your products and services?</h4>
<p>We are focused on two types of products: savings and credit. We currently have a payday loan, which is an unsecured product targeting salary deduction and a savings product that is a goal-based savings plan. We have significantly ramped up awareness and had a big launch. We held a Facebook live chat and have completed some plans via Twitter live chat, so we are truly pushing the envelope in terms of how we interact with the public. On the ground, we have a &ldquo;feet on the street" strategy because we truly have to get close to the community and let people know we are here. Our vision is to be the best retail bank with an enviable culture by 2020.</p>
<h4>2018 was one of the best years in Jamaican history. How has this helped change the profile of your client base?</h4>
<p>There is definitely optimism and positive results in some instances in the economy as a whole. Interest rates are decreasing and it is a great time to be an SME or large corporation seeking to expand. The cost of capital to a business owner looking to expand is much lower than it was five years ago. Our client base is currently looking at expansion plans; many are going in and looking to either pivot to an adjacent business or expand their existing one.</p>
<h4>What are your goals for 2019?</h4>
<p>Our main goal is to open up to 25 bank agents across Jamaica by the end of the year and reach communities across the island, and if we can do that well, we will change not just the face of First Global Bank but also how the public views the banking sector. Another goal is to increase our employee engagement score, which is in the high 50s. The best score globally is 63%, so my main goal is to produce a culture where everyone feels valued and appreciated.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[exciting-times]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main highlights in terms of accomplishments and challenges for the group?</h4>
<p>We recently launched our VM Drive Auto Loan product and VM Unsecured Loan product. These products are part of our commitment to listen to our customers. In 2018, we disbursed loans totaling JMD9.6 billion and held a series of mortgage expos across Jamaica, aimed at educating our members on financial independence through home ownership. These are significant accomplishments and we are carrying this momentum into 2019. Our superior products and an excellent turnaround time is helping us to increase our market share. We are also excited about the IPO for Victoria Mutual Investments that was launched in December 2017; it was highly successful as it was oversubscribed four times. The performance of the company's overseas offices in the UK and the US are extremely positive. Although we don't have an office in Canada, it is another market in North America that has given us good business. Another significant accomplishment is the opening of our representative office in New York in November 2018. We have focused on three important areas. First, the company had a culture refresh in March 2018. Second, we underwent an organizational redesign to drive greater productivity by simplifying the organizational structure in some areas. And third, the company has devised a new digital strategy to establish a strong presence in the digital arena, an objective that falls under its Victoria Mutual strategic goals.</p>
<h4>How important is Victoria Mutual's international expansion?</h4>
<p>The international market holds great significance for us because the Victoria Building Society (VMBS) was the first Jamaican financial institution to establish overseas offices, in the UK in 1983. The Jamaican diaspora continues to have a huge interest in investing in Jamaica and even though the majority don't intend to move back, they want to own a piece of real estate for investment or holidaying. Over the years, the number of mortgage applications from the diaspora have increased and that is an encouraging sign. The representative offices help the company to establish and strengthen relationships. This strategy has worked for us through our offices in the UK and Florida, and we will use the same method in our New York office.</p>
<h4>How has your support for small- and medium-sized enterprises helped to change the profile of your client base?</h4>
<p>Recently, we established a presence in the construction sector by offering commercial mortgages with terms that are better than those offered by commercial banks. Believing in talent is one of our core principles and that is why we help SMEs through our pension fund management. In order to drive stronger growth in the SME sector, several businesses have been taken to the capital market by Victoria Mutual Wealth Management, a subsidiary of Victoria Mutual Investments Limited. Through collective efforts of all our subsidiaries, we are, in fact, helping Jamaican SMEs to grow and achieve new heights.</p>
<h4>How is the company's direction toward digitalization helping people understand the services and products on offer?</h4>
<p>A digital transformation is vital to increase Victoria Mutual's relevance and remove the barriers between its international offices. Our focus on digitalization has enabled us to provide high-quality service delivery to our clients. Our Board of Directors recently approved a digital transformation strategy that will revolutionize the way we do business. As our strategy unfolds, our members and clients will experience increased ease of doing business, as well as innovative products and services. Our primary goal is to give our customers an exceptional experience.</p>
<h4>What are your goals and challenges for 2019?</h4>
<p>One of our primary areas of focus is to generate stronger revenue growth through new products and targeting new market segments. Jamaica's economy is not achieving the desired levels of growth and we can help by opening doors to greater financial opportunities. Meanwhile, it is important to improve our efficiency and we are putting emphasis on shifting our transactions to digital channels to boost productivity.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[engaging-with-the-community]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main accomplishments for the group in 2018?</h4><p>We have been able to develop our product and company and grow as a business in terms of profitability as we approach our 20th year of doing business in Jamaica. We were also able to introduce a new payment method for one of our lines of business using recurring credit card payments. Moreover, we have been engaging with several technology companies as we look at improving our policy administration system. We have also gone into real estate development and are currently completing our first such project, a seven-story housing complex that we expect to complete in 1Q2019. At that time, we will hand over the upscale development of 66 apartment units to their new owners; all the units were sold in a week. We will undertake a second construction project to develop a 175-unit complex in early 2019.</p><h4>How are you expanding your operations in the country?</h4><p>We are looking to develop not only real estate, but also the country's commercial stock as we grow our business from an investment standpoint. We do not just build and hold; we build and sell so that individuals can purchase and own something of their own. We are also looking to grow our market share in the individual and group life portfolios of our business.</p><h4>How do you maximize awareness of your products and services?</h4><p>In addition to engaging traditional advertising campaigns, we also engage our various target segments through social media. We work tirelessly to maintain a strong distribution network, which includes insurance advisors that are employed by the company and brokerage houses that are located across the island and share the features and benefits of our products and services with the public. In addition, we promote our products, particularly health insurance and group products, by providing mobile medical services across the length and breadth of Jamaica, using a highly visible, branded medical unit. The mobile medical unit has been visiting communities and improving public health through routine medical checks. Another major initiative is hosting one of the largest and most successful 5-km night runs in Kingston and Montego Bay. Our Montego Bay race grew by about 30% in 2017, and all the income from it goes to four major public hospitals to purchase medical equipment. Through our runs, we also partner with many charities to help them raise money and increase the number of participants in the races.</p><h4>How do you see the economy evolving?</h4><p>Business confidence is growing, and the responsible government agencies have been working at meeting the required inflation targets and other economic indicators, which bodes well for the economy. The stock market is doing well, which demonstrates investor confidence in the economy. The junior stock exchange is a great place to raise capital, especially for family-owned companies. Between stock market growth and the boom in the economy, sectors such as tourism are doing well. We are confident about the future of our country and that the sacrifices made in the past to debt exchange are finally paying off.<br>What are your goals for 2019?<br>One of the biggest targets for us in 2019 will be getting our major real estate project off the ground, which will have a great impact on the skyline of New Kingston. 2019 promises to be exciting, as the growth of the economy continues to lift all boats. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Exports to Over 50 Countries]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[hasan-ulusoy-chairman-nobel-ilac]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What impact did the annual adjustment of pharmaceutical prices have on Nobel Ilaç's operations, as well as the broader pharmaceutical industry?</h4><p>This is not the first time that we have been through the annual adjustment—it can happen upon any price increase. Since price increases are typically announced some time before the effective date, some companies choose to deliver products at the previous price as a sales argument. It is in fact no different than common surplus or rebate practices and it creates a demand from warehouses and pharmacies. As a company, we are not prone to compromise in sales, thus we do not have any special implementations to apply in such periods. We experience no problems in our product delivery either. Our supply system obliges us to make planning months in advance, and since we do not keep a large stock at the consumption channel, we cannot be open to extraordinary demands.</p><h4>More broadly, how does the Turkish pharmaceutical regulatory structure support the healthcare sector, and what changes could be made to improve it?</h4><p>Turkey is a global example in terms of drug legislation, production ability and capacity as well as access to drugs. We have a sufficient number of factories and R&amp;D facilities in GMP standards that can readily satisfy the national requirements. About 150,000 physicians and 25,000 pharmacies produce about 500 million prescriptions annually and we convey 2.5 billion boxes of drugs to our people. While the system is sound, what is missing on the regulatory side is national regulation of biosimilar products. I have always said that such regulation will improve the market for Turkish pharmaceutical companies. What is in practice at the moment is mostly taken from Europe and the US and these regulations make it difficult for Turkish pharmaceutical companies to come to the market. If you look at similar countries success in biosimilars such as Russia, South Korea, India and China they have been operating with their own regulatory systems. Turkey can experience the same success with the implementation of a similar system.</p><h4>How does the increasing strain on Turkey's health insurance system impact the pharmaceutical industry and Nobel Ilaç's operations?</h4><p>Currently, save for a very limited number of exceptions, the entire population in Turkey is covered by health insurance. This is a benefit we should be proud of, since even among the developed countries, many are unable to provide it. However, such an inclusive system also brings about financing problems. In the past 15 years, along with the increase in the population and average age, the improvements in access to health services and medication have unexpectedly increased the costs. Just think about it, in the past 15 years, the number of referrals to a health center has increased fourfold per person. As of today, each of us visit a physician more than 8 times, have 6 prescriptions issued and consume 30 boxes of medicines a year on average. About 80 percent of drug consumption is financed by the public budget. We are proud with the level of services we have achieved as a country. However, the methods used when the financial resources needed to enable this system are scarce, cause a lot of suffering to our industry. Drug prices have been in constant decline despite inflation and increasing foreign exchange rates, thus the main agenda for the companies in the sector has been to survive. As Nobel, we enjoy a greater feeling of security due to the fact that our activities have not been limited to our efficient domestic operations, but we have also internationally expanded and become a net exporter. However, at the current point, we fear that drug supply in Turkey will no longer be sustainable and our culture of R&amp;D and production will be damaged.</p><h4>What investments has Nobel Ilaç made—in part through the 2023 vision—in the area of biosimilar drugs?</h4><p>One of the main reasons for the funding problem I have mentioned above is that we are still considerably foreign-dependent in the field of drugs. Each year, the pharma industry incurs a foreign trade deficit of about 4 billion dollars. That's why “reducing foreign dependency in drugs" has been introduced as a target into state programs such as the 10th Development Plan and the 2023 vision document. This is indeed the main purpose of the program that has been initiated to support the domestic development and production of biosimilar drugs. As you have mentioned, we have been chosen as the first company and are working together with TUBITAK on this project. The first stage of the project, namely the cell development, has already been completed. Next are the more advanced stages. We have made the necessary investments and have been progressing in a determined manner. This is very much in line with the general stance of our company as a champion pharmaceutical exporter with no foreign trade deficit. We consider the field of biotechnology as one of the most crucial conditions for future existence and success.</p><h4>Another key area of investment for Nobel Ilaç is in injectables and other hospital products. Why were this area chosen?</h4><p>First, we needed the injectables plant for the production of the finished biosimilar products. The second reason is to increase our exports. We are operating in countries where injectables are very much used and plan a lot of exports to those countries. Domestically, the use of injectables in Turkey is also increasing. As the government has built city hospitals which will enhance health tourism, the use of such products in the hospitals will increase.  </p><h4>Where are Nobel Ilaç's most import export markets and where are you expecting to see the most future demand growth?</h4><p>Currently, we have been carrying out marketing and sales operations in twenty countries through our own teams. We have been active in an extensive geographical region from Central Asia to Eastern Europe, in part through our international production facilities in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, which were our first steps in international expansion that started 20 years ago. These countries had a potential and were open to development. These facilities not only satisfy national needs but also provide a means for exports to the neighboring regions. More recently, our newest export destination is Russia, which is especially important to us as it holds a potential equal to the combined total of all the other countries we have been active in. It is difficult to gain a place in the Russian market but our initial results are very promising. As future endeavors, we have been considering Africa, Middle East and some European countries. We have already taken the first steps in some of them.</p><h4>What are Nobel Ilaç's most important ongoing investment plans and biggest objectives?</h4><p>Our investments are ongoing in the biotechnology area, and our objective is to finish our facility and proceed with our project so that we can be in the market with these products by 2023 at the latest. Outside of that, we hope to continue to increase our domestic market share and to achieve our targets in our foreign operations.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[luis-young-virzi-executive-vice-president-worldwide-medical]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does Panama represent to WorldWide's portfolio?</h4><p>The company started in the Dominican Republic 20 years ago, and then stablish its headquarters in Panama as the hub for further expansion. Panama was better adapted to host central offices, thanks to its connectivity, local economic and political stability. This is how we have developed the health market in Panama. We expect to close the year with approximately USD25 million in premiums, nearly 40% of the total premium of the group. The other premiums come from the Dominican Republic and three other markets, which we opened as a joint venture with other insurance companies. We introduced our innovative international major medical products to Guatemala, Paraguay, and Bolivia. We will continue to expand our operations into other countries in Central and South America following this same philosophy.</p><h4>How have you managed to stand out from the competition?</h4><p>I believe that our priority is to provide a boutique/concierge style service to our clients. We are a company that has managed to thrive with fewer than 60 people in Panama. We are, therefore, close to our distribution channel and our clients. We have an excellent relationship with brokers, allowing them to have a close relationship with all departments in WorldWide Medical. They can reach the people they need to with a single phone call. That makes a difference to the intermediary and final insurer. In 2018, we were awarded the Excellence Award by CAPECOSE, a great distinction in the insurance industry. In addition to being distinctive from our competition in providing service, we also excel in having innovative products. We are constantly introducing new benefits into our products, so they remain updated in the market. </p><h4>What new sectors would you like to target? </h4><p>The major medical product targets a certain segment of the market. Economically speaking, it is middle to high classes of the pyramid and international companies looking for the best health and disability coverage for their executives. These parts of the pyramid represent the population that have access to a policy at a relatively high premium. We are good at what we do, and we want to maintain our specialist leadership in that part of the market. Therefore, in order to attract these companies to our business, we have good relationships with our brokers and we continually provide solutions for our partners. We mostly cover executives. The practice in Panama is to provide a different scale of coverage for them.</p><h4>What is your commitment to the development of the health sector in the country?</h4><p>If you look at the Latin American markets, local health systems are not well developed. This could be because some countries do not have the critical mass of demand, and in others there is no investment. However, we bring two important things to the countries we enter. One is making sure the money spent on health remains in the country. For example, in Panama, 70% of our paid claims remain in Panama. The remainder is abroad, in the US and elsewhere. That 70% is maybe over USD15 million, all solely from ourselves. This provides for hospital growth, new investments in the health sector, new hires, and new developments in the whole sector. We take this same methodology to other countries in order to develop their healthcare systems. By opening new operations, we help improve the health systems in those countries because we promote local investment. Our philosophy is to enter the health ecosystem in every single way.</p><h4>What are your main targets for 2019?</h4><p>This will be another year of several challenges. We grew 15% in total premiums in 2018, and we expect the same for 2019. Additionally, we expect to grow at three times the pace of the rest of the industry. We are also introducing new products this year. We want a better product in terms of coverage and benefits for those seeking improvements. On the other hand, we continue to look at opportunities for our expansion plan in Central and South America. I see 2019 as a continuation of our good performance, as well as a year when we consolidate our presence in Guatemala, Paraguay, and Bolivia.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Would you tell us about IESE Business School's origins and evolution since 1958?</h4><p>IESE Business School started as a business school 60 years ago in 1958 and was among the first of its kind. Our origins are in Barcelona, which in the late 1950s was Spain's commercial capital in many respects. We started with programs for senior executives. The first program we offered was Advanced Management for owners and senior executives of mostly mid-sized, family-owned businesses from the Barcelona region. IESE Business School has grown since then, and today we have five campuses in Madrid, Barcelona, Munich, New York, and Sío Paulo. We have grown from offering only very senior executive education programs to offering MBAs and master's management programs spanning from young, recent graduates through to the most senior executives domestically and at the international level. In fact, we started the first MBA program in Europe in 1964, and today our MBA program has students from around 60 countries — 25% from Asia, 35% from Europe, 17% from North America, and 23% from Latin America. We have 115 full time faculty members who come from about 30 countries. Therefore, the school has a quite international set up. Spain is in a completely different situation than when we started. Today, the country is a flourishing democracy, and we have been able to grow from being an educational startup in Barcelona to being a broad multinational operation in the education space.</p><h4>What is IESE Business School's strategy for attracting international students and do your collaborations and offices in Asia play a role in this?</h4><p>Our offices definitely play a role. With a constant presence, with people on the ground in the market, you can explain better services to students in these countries. Our MBA program is international. This is attractive to prospective students. These are people who want to have an international business career, and they want to interact with people from many countries. They are also interested in coming to a school that emphasizes entrepreneurship. Through our programs, we provide students opportunities to start their own businesses. Students are also interested in the strong emphasis we put on purpose and values. From the beginning, IESE Business School has had a clear purpose and important role to play in society. We believe that business leaders need to understand what their responsibilities are.</p><h4>IESE Business School's program was named in 2018 the top full time MBA program globally by The Economist. Is there something specific about Spain that attracts international students to come here?</h4><p>In the education sector, Spain has been able to develop world-class institutions over the past 60 years. Some other comparable economies in Europe have not been able to do this for many reasons. Of course, Spain is a popular destination as a travel destination. When you combine Spain's sights with the country's education and business experience, it makes Spain an attractive proposition for international students.</p><h4>What is your relationship with the University of Navarra?</h4><p>We are part of the University of Navarra. We are the Graduate School of Business there. It is natural for business schools to be part of academic institutions, because there are more and more interactions between what is being taught in business schools and other parts of universities. Today, we all talk a lot about how technology is changing business. One of the things we are looking at is how we can leverage for the business education process the knowledge of technology that is present at universities. In fact, the origin of the word university alludes to the entire body of knowledge that a person should be mastering and accessing. This synergy makes us strong.</p><h4>How does IESE Business School interact with the private sector?</h4><p>We are close to business in several different ways. We interact with the business community when they look for talent to recruit from our students. At the same time, we interact with the private sector in our role as a provider of executive education to senior corporate executives. At the corporate level, we also offer customized executive education. There are a good number of companies that come to us with specific training requests for their executives. We design custom-made training programs for them. We are one of the bigger providers in this space. Our exposure to the business community is intense. This means we have a good sense of what is going on in various sectors. As we offer general management programs, we have broad exposure. We do not host students and participants from a specific sector. Besides teaching the private sector, we also offer a program at our Madrid campus for senior civil servants to help them improve their management skills.</p><h4>IESE Business School has had a collaboration with Harvard Business School for over 50 years. What role does that collaboration play?</h4><p>Our connection with Harvard Business School goes back a long way, starting in the early 1960s. At the time, we were trying to improve our ability to teach through the Case Method, which Harvard was already using. Several Harvard faculty members were part of the academic team that launched our MBA program in 1964. Since then, we have had a tight collaboration with Harvard Business School. We currently offer two senior executive programs jointly with them. One is at our Barcelona campus and the other is run in different parts of the world. We also collaborate with other institutions on specific projects or programs, such as our CEO program with the Wharton School and our collaboration with CEIBS in Shanghai. Our MBA program also has an exchange program with more than 30 of the most renowned business schools.</p><h4>What impact and implications do you see digitization and the internationalization of study having on the future of higher education?</h4><p>One side of internationalization, it boils down to students traveling or taking up residence in different parts of the world. This is what happens in our MBA program, where people come from afar and spend a year and a half with us or at another campus, such as in New York, Sío Paulo, or Shanghai. At the same time, digital and online learning and communication is a way to bridge distances in a way that allows you to reach new communities. IESE Business School also offers complete online programs.</p><h4>What challenges and opportunities do you see generally in the field of education for the near future?</h4><p>Technology is bringing changes in the workplace environment and new companies and business models are being built. One of the clear trends for the education sector is that people will need to educate themselves even more than in the past, but this may be in different formats. There is a need to accompany people as they go up from their first undergraduate and work experience through life, career, and position changes. It used to be the years between 25 and 65 were relatively static but working life has been extended and this will be accompanied by additional educational experiences. The education sector's role in peoples' lives will actually be growing and diversifying. Education will become more flexible and lifelong learning will become a need and a reality. This is a great opportunity for the education sector, because it is there to meet these kinds of needs.</p><h4>What are some of IESE Business School's objectives for 2019-2020?</h4><p>We are involved in an important expansion of IESE Business School's physical footprint in Madrid. When that is completed in 2020, it will double our level of activities in Madrid. In 2020 we will have also just started our new Masters in Management program and will be offering a lot more educational programs online.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is SURE International Technology positioning itself within the digital transformation of the Kingdom?</h4><p>Since 2004, SURE has been acting as a system integrator, having developed more than 2,400 e-services for various government agencies, from ministries to universities and hospitals, as part of the country's digital transformation. More recently, we have entered the financial sector and are facilitating the growth and contribution of SMEs in line with government directives through new products and business units. With Vision 2030 and the NTP 2.0, the government is investing a lot of capital in building a solid infrastructure. One of the main focuses in this sense has been cloud computing, and we seek to take advantage of this trend to act as a migrator for both governments and companies. At the same time, we are placing considerable efforts on developing new partnerships with local and international players to introduce security products to the market. There is an urgent need to protect access to data and reduce damage effects because external actors are constantly threatening Saudi cyber-infrastructure. As far as 2019 is concerned, we expect to expand internationally, grow our business and serve a new customer base, and continue building a lot of partnerships with vendors, suppliers, and clients.  </p><h4>Within these three business units, how do you expect demand to evolve in the short to medium term, and what trends will be driving this evolution?</h4><p>In the fintech arena there's definitely a push from a regulatory perspective, with lot of focus coming from SAMA, CMA, Saudi Fintech Initiative, and from companies interested in entering that market. The authorities are pushing the banks to move toward a cashless society and embrace electronic payments, e-wallets and digital wallets, and all these initiatives will intensify the market. At the same time, there are a lot of efforts that seek to reduce the entrance barrier for startups and SMEs to take Saudi Arabia's standards on par with other global markets. At SURE, there is a strong willingness to enter this market, since even the enterprise companies need to upgrade their systems to cope with the new technology trends. The current push from the government lowers the risk perception these companies have before they invest in making these upgrades, so there is definitely an opportunity for vendors like us.</p><h4>How would you assess the receptiveness of new technological platforms?</h4><p>It's quite high because this market is maturing. There are a lot of opportunities, we just need someone to come and grasp them. A lot of industries are undergoing transformation with a lot of investments, and technology is going to play a major role in this phenomenon. Tourism, entertainment, hospitality, industry 4.0, and the NIDLP, to position Saudi Arabia as a logistic hub for three continents, are all part of the progressive changes the country is witnessing, and digital transformation is the key.</p><h4>What are the key trends that Saudi Arabia and investors should look at for 2019?</h4><p>The major trends should be joint ventures and partnerships, because in the Middle East or Saudi you have local partners with good businesses, but want to move to the next level. To do so, one needs a different knowledge and experience and new products to introduce to the market. Another trend that has the gained prominence is business intelligence: big data is coming strongly to Saudi, and the market is big enough to allow healthy competition that will raise the overall quality of the industry.  </p><h4>What impact will big data and artificial Intelligence have on Saudi society, and how can it strike a balance between implementing automation and decreasing unemployment?</h4><p>Big data will impact everyone, from the decision-makers in government who are drawing up budgets to consumers making their household budgets. Government entities will have newly developed solutions to analyze data, forecast, measure performance, and adjust their spending patterns. On the other hand, AI will create more jobs by eliminating jobs that do not require humans. In this sense, we need people to develop smart design and focus on operations and management. AI will not replace jobs, but it will add value for us and create more jobs. It is a cycle that will bring overall benefits to society. The young population and talent available here are the perfect fit for creating the jobs of the future.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Agriculture is a pillar of the Colombian economy. How will the government's development policy aid the agricultural sector?</h4><p>The purpose of the policy is to order two of the most important processes: production and marketing. The first, through the strategy of Production Management and the second through the "Coseche y Venda a la Fija" strategy (Contract farming). The Production Management strategy seeks to promote agricultural transformation, strengthening planning processes to make efficient use of resources, smoothing oversupply and scarcity cycles, reducing price volatility, encouraging innovation and technological development, improving quality according to market demand, and integrating agribusiness production with small- and medium-sized producers, while seeking to enhance the competitiveness of national production. Furthermore, the strategy will concentrate public and private investment in the most productive regions identified by the UPRA, prioritizing the following 10 products: potato, onion, rice, corn, avocado, panela, forestry, cotton, milk, fishing industry, and aquaculture. The Production Management strategy relies on five components. The first is agricultural frontier, which entails the identification of the best performance municipalities through a zoning model. The second component is productive planning with a focus on reducing price volatility. Another element is technical assistance through the regulation of Law 1876 of 2017 for the provision of the agricultural extension service. The fourth component is access to finance through Finagro services such as Special Credit Lines (LEC), the Agricultural Guarantee Fund (FAG), and the Agricultural Insurance Incentive. The last component, improving infrastructure and marketing, includes, for example, access to land adaptation, processing and storage infrastructure, as well as the strategy of contract farming and tackling agricultural smuggling. “Coseche y Venda a la Fija“ is a well-defined strategy designed by the national government using the contract farming model. This model can be defined as agricultural production carried out according to an agreement between a buyer and a farmer, which establishes conditions for the production and marketing of a farm product. Through this strategy, the national government seeks to generate greater equity in the distribution of generated profits throughout market chains, such that producers obtain better and more stable income. To encourage the coordination of small- and medium-sized producers with the industry, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development has designed and implemented financial and technical incentives. Finagro, through intermediaries such as banks and financial cooperatives, will give the producers financial incentives. For this purpose, the National Agricultural Credit Commission (CNCA) created the LEC with a subsidized "contract farming" rate aimed at small- and medium-sized producers. To access finance, the producer must prove to the Financial Intermediary the subscription of a contract, which must consider the following: The term for the fulfillment of obligations derived from the aforementioned contract that guarantee the payment of the credit obligation may not exceed the term of the credit; the subject matter of the contract must be the purchase and/or supply of agricultural products with a third party; the connection as beneficiary of the payment to the financial intermediary; and the price or a system for calculating the price as well as the quantity or a system for determining the quantity. The interest rate of this LEC is equivalent to the DTF - 1% a.e. for small producers and DTF + 1% a.e. for medium producers, reaching subsidies of 7% and 6% a.e., as well as FAG coverage of 50% and 40%. The term of the credit must be in accordance with the productive cycle plus 60 calendar days, without exceeding one year. The Rural Development Agency (ADR) is to be responsible for the technical incentives. These incentives seek to strengthen marketing processes and link producers to stable market chains through services such as business training, legalization of associations, marketing, support for certification in BPA or in BPM, technical assistance, and participation in business roundtables.</p><h4>What role does agriculture play in Colombia's export economy, and how will the government's strategy to improve the export economy affect the agriculture sector?</h4><p>Agriculture has historically been among the major engines of the Colombian economy, allowing Colombia to position itself as a supplier of high-quality and differentiated products such as cocoa, coffee, flowers, and bananas. The strategy of boosting the country's exports is based largely on the promotion of non-traditional products, and a strategy is aimed at overcoming trade barriers for agricultural goods. Being a tropical country with unique agro-ecological conditions and a variety of products with global appeal, Colombia has great competitive advantages in the agribusiness sector.</p><h4>In partnership with Canada, the ministry has launched the “Agroemprende Cacao“ program to support entrepreneurship in the cacao sector. What does this program seek to achieve, and what does the partnership with Canada mean for Colombian cacao producers?</h4><p>The program aims to increase productivity of the farms under 5,500 cocoa producing families by 30%; increase women empowerment and participation in the sector; sow or improve over 3,300ha of cocoa; increase the volume of cocoa sold through 55 associations and cooperatives; and establish funds or commercial alliances to support cooperatives. The project will be implemented in Putumayo, Meta, Boyacá, Santander, and Antioquia, among others, and seeks to strengthen and support at least 3,300 ha under agroforestry systems, including cocoa, plantain, and timber. It also aims to improve access to new markets and consolidate sustainable business at the cooperative level with Canada, the 13th largest importer of cocoa beans in the world, representing 1.9% (USD180 million) of global sales.</p><h4>How is the government looking to simplify the ICA licensing processes that medical cannabis companies must undergo?</h4><p>The process to obtain the licenses for growing cannabis is fundamental for the good technical development of the crop. The medical cannabis sector is governed by existing regulations for the management, production, and commercialization of seeds necessary to guarantee the technical characterization of the materials to be cultivated. On the other hand, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development provides technical advice to anyone who requires it to comply with the requirements demanded by the ICA in matters related to the acquisition of certifications issued.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess the measures taken by the Malaysian government in the 2019 budget to restore fiscal buffers, improve governance, and regain consumer and investor confidence?</h4>
<p>It is important to see the budget and policies for 2019 within the context of Malaysia's broader development narrative. The development model of this country has traditionally been based on an export-oriented strategy which has worked well for many decades. Recently, however, questions have been raised about the appropriateness of this model going forward and how Malaysia can shift to a new development model to further climb up the income ladder and reach high-income and developed country status. Part of this challenge is boosting education outcomes and productivity growth to ensure that Malaysia's human capital is ready to propel it into that reality. When the new Government assumed power, there were a number of challenges it had to confront, and the budgetary cycle was an opportunity for it to unveil its policy directions vis-a-vis these challenges. In the near term, it had to manage its budget and fiscal position, grow the economy, give confidence to the private sector, and protect the vulnerable in society. The government knew it had to strike a careful balance, and we were fairly pleased that the budget included a number of pragmatic elements. On the revenue side, the Government introduced some positive measures related to taxation and strengthening its administration. It also signaled there would be a greater emphasis on good governance, accountability, and transparency. Naturally, there are ongoing challenges. Malaysia's tax revenues as a percentage of its GDP are relatively low at 16-17%, whereas in OECD countries it is typically over 30%. Moreover, about 20% of fiscal revenues come from the oil sector. This poses certain vulnerabilities for the Government in the potential event of an external oil shock. Looking at the budget within a broader economic context, we are still fairly positive as the economy still rests on strong fundamentals.</p>
<h4>What are your expectations around the impact of the National Industry 4.0 Policy Framework on the performance of Malaysia's manufacturing industries?</h4>
<p>In October 2018, the National Industry 4.0 Policy Framework for Industry 4.0 was launched, which was a positive initiative by the Government. Its success will ultimately rest on the ability of firms, particularly SMEs, to adopt new digital technologies. This framework will have to tackle issues like providing credit to firms that need it and getting connected digitally. Our recently-completed report on Malaysia's Digital Economy found that the country was doing fairly well in terms of connectivity and e-services, both on the government and individual levels. The digital adoption rates of firms in Malaysia, however, are relatively low compared to other countries in the region. One key factor impacting the digital economy was the comparatively high prices for fixed broadband services and a lack of competition. The Government is now encouraging greater competition in the telecoms sector, which is leading to lower prices for fixed broadband and higher digital adoption among firms. There is also the question of human resources: giving these firms access to an adequate supply of talent can help them make the next leap forward.</p>
<h4>How do you assess the efforts of the government to reform TVET?</h4>
<p>In a general sense, looking at the labor market and unemployment rate, the overall storyline is fairly encouraging. But beyond that, youth unemployment remains an issue to be tackled. This is where programs like TVET can play a role in supporting fresh graduates make the school to job transition. The challenge in this sector is fragmentation as there are many programs scattered across different agencies. Taking a holistic view and streamlining the programs to ensure the quality of trainers and programs, and also encouraging young Malaysians to go down this track are important factors. We see an issue of an over-supply of programs but insufficient demand for them. In Europe, some Governments have been fairly successful in integrating different programs, so Malaysia could potentially find value in emulating some of these systems to ensure TVET can help upskill current and future youth and enable them to meet the challenges of the future job market.</p>
<h4>You have argued that Malaysia needs to do more to promote better learning outcomes. How does the World Bank support Malaysia toward realizing higher human capital?</h4>
<p>Human development outcomes around the world need to improve if we are to meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. Over the last two decades, there has been a real emphasis on the development of human capital by various organizations. There has also been a recognition that we are not moving fast enough as a community of nations to meet the challenges of human capital accumulation, particularly in health and education. In the health domain, there are twin challenges of infectious diseases and non-communicable diseases. On the education front, the World Bank has published several reports that attempt to raise the alarm. Our latest World Development Report highlighted that enrolment rates are insufficient as an indicator of progress; we also have to look at learning outcomes. When we did so, it was startling to see how many countries are not focusing enough on ensuring that school children are actually learning in class. To that end, the World Bank introduced the new Human Capital Index in 2018 which provides a measure of the future potential of a child born today given the prevailing human development conditions in her or his country. We used data to create a composite index and ranked countries according to their respective scores. It is both astonishing and encouraging that four of the top five performers of the HCI came from the East Asia and Pacific region. Malaysia did well in certain areas but lagged behind in other areas. The two areas where improvements are needed are in childhood stunting and the quality of education. As of now, one in five children in Malaysia are stunted, and we are encouraging the Ministry of Health and others to delve into this issue. The data however, shows that it is not so much an issue of income that is affecting childhood stunting, as it is pervasive throughout urban and rural areas and among income levels. Other countries that have been able to solve this problem, such as Peru, have shown that it requires multiple strategies and interventions by different government agencies to tackle this issue. Another area of concern is the quality of education. The country's most recent scores in education do not compare as well as those of its aspirational peers, such as Hong Kong, Taiwan, or South Korea. We hope to support the Government in its efforts to make improvements in this critical area for development.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[uche-dimiri-managing-director-depthwize]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Despite a declining market, how have you managed to repay your loans?</h4><p>We have had to trim the workforce, and as a result of good service quality, we kept on working for our top client, who continued to make investments in field development despite the downturn. We were drilling most of our client's deep wells and a new hydrocarbon discovery. Moreover, we drilled some of the best wells in the country, as deep as 19,700ft, which is how we survived. We realized about six wells for our top client and were able to ramp up production from 8,000bpd to about 25,000bpd, with huge potential for further increases. For the oil and gas industry, 2015, 2016, and 2017 were difficult years. It is beginning to ramp up now, albeit with a lag in increasing prices and confidence amongst oil companies to commit to drilling. </p><h4>Do you expect indigenous players to play a bigger role in the oil and gas industry in 2019?</h4><p>I do, but there is confusion amongst the indigenous players on the E&amp;P side with court cases. They seem to want to have their cake and eat it; they want to drill and explore, but with someone else picking up the tab. We can improve in these areas from a working perspective, at least in making business more forward. Funding is the key issue, and it is why many indigenous players have not attained their true potential. </p><h4>What is the reason behind the lack of funding?</h4><p>Many people are scared of doing business in Nigeria. One has to often get funding externally, from international investors, which requires local actors to inspire a certain level of confidence. In Nigeria, there are issues such as political risk, environmental issues, and insurgencies in the Niger Delta, not to mention the northeast, all of which makes raising capital difficult.</p><h4>How does this situation reflect on the service side?</h4><p>Service quality is one issue, and another is lack of funding. When the oil price bottomed out, the declining number of operational rigs continued to decline. Therefore, it took a while for that to correct itself, and the ensuing lag led to caution. One thing that can improve, from the E&amp;P to the service side, is early payments for work done.</p><h4>How competitive is the environment, and how do you stand out from the competition?</h4><p>Competition is brutal. We stand out due to our people, intelligence, and solid assets, and through word of mouth. What makes competition even more intense is that many companies that should not be tendering are doing so. Another issue is that since many E&amp;P companies have not been drilling, service companies have no jobs, so they continue to incur losses as their equipment depreciates. </p><h4>How can Nigeria's oil and gas industry inspire greater confidence among international investors and banks, and bring a better business sentiment to the industry?</h4><p>Nigeria is one of the world's easiest places to drill for oil. Once a company discovers oil, permeability is high, meaning the oil will rapidly move through the rock. These are key characteristics that aid crude recovery; however, there is a serious need for facilities to transport this crude from offshore locations. There is also a security consideration throughout the industry. Nonetheless, Nigeria has skilled professionals who can take a company from the first stage to the last, and this should give confidence to global investors.</p><p>What is your outlook for the year ahead?</p><p>I want to keep our three rigs working. In 2017 and 2018, I simply told my people that we needed to survive the downturn. We have to take risks because, quite simply, if nothing is ventured, nothing will be gained. Our plan was to have five rigs within five years, and we were well on our way to fulfill that before to the downturn. Therefore, at present, we are looking at alliances with key partners and a degree of expansion where we can leverage others' assets</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[80th Anniversary in the UAE]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[ali-al-janabi-country-chairman-shell-group-companies-uae-shell]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us about the defining features of Shell's operations in Abu Dhabi and the significance of the UAE for Shell?</h4><p>This year we will celebrate our 80th anniversary in the UAE. This is a journey we started back in 1939, and our relationship in the UAE began in Abu Dhabi, but expanded to include Dubai. Historically, we had a 9.5% stake in ADCO until the license expired in 2013, In 1978 we established the ADNOC Gas Industries, or GASCO, a joint venture with Total and Partex. We hold 15% alongside Total's 15% with Partex having 2% and ADNOC maintaining a 68% share. Two years ago, we celebrated 50 years in Dubai, where we have been supplying aviation fuel with a significant market share of that going to Dubai's airports to this day. With 500 plus staff across the Emirates, we are firmly committed to the UAE. We have a significant presence across the full value chain including upstream, midstream and downstream. With trading offices for some of our products, we supply chemicals, lubricants and commercial fuels. Strategically, we deliver regional support to areas such as Iraq and other joint ventures in markets such as Oman and Kuwait. While our concession continues for another ten years or so, we explore other opportunities in which we can partner. Our discussions with ADNOC aim to uncover how we can best align their priorities with our financial framework.</p><h4>Where do you see opportunities to further deepen this relationship with the UAE, and what are some of the issues that you are exploring?</h4><p>Beyond the joint ventures we have been involved in with ADNOC in a number of ways, R&amp;D and enhanced oil recovery (EOR) competency has led to senior Shell experts based here supporting ADNOC in related projects. There is also very strong support upstream as well as for midstream and downstream activity. Additionally, we are also involved in human capital support with ADNOC Gas Processing, and have secondees in various ADNOC departments such as finance or HR. Our gas research center was set up in 2010 with several ongoing projects, in conjunction with the Petroleum Institute, today a part of Khalifa University. Shell is a lot more involved with gas when we compare our portfolio to other IOCs, which was by design. Shell has made bold commitments with regards to greenhouse gas emissions. Regarding collaborations we will continue to look at where other projects can develop in step with ADNOC, and Shell's collaborations over the past three years have been very focused.</p><h4>How are you working in EOR projects and how do you assess Abu Dhabi's EOR targets?</h4><p>Shell has vast expertise in EOR built over 40 years, and is probably the leader in EOR. This experience has been developed in neighboring countries. ADNOC's oil target goes from 3.5 million barrels to 4 million barrels to 5 million barrels. They are very well managed reservoirs, but the question is how do you extract more from them, and with gas injections of CO2 can they be effective? There are a number of pilot schemes being deployed regarding CO2 and polymers, which is a segment of our research and development activities. Getting more out of the existing reservoirs and exploration efforts around the new reservoirs also helps to achieve production of five million bbl/d. From an EOR perspective going from gas injection to water flood should free up quite a lot of gas, which could help achieve ADNOC's gas self-sufficiency target, which is within reach. There is a combination of new gas exploration, the unconventional as well as switching from gas injection to water flooding that should release some of the gas already injected, potentially developing some of the gas caps that ADNOC has drawn attention to.</p><h4>What will be fundamental for the UAE to achieve gas self-sufficiency?</h4><p>Today ADNOC Gas Processing probably supplies at least 65 to 70% of Abu Dhabi's gas need. This is for the domestic market for power and water, but also for gas injection and exports through LNG, and amounts to almost 6.5 BCF per day. ADNOC Gas Processing is world class in terms of size and complexity. I call it the refinery equivalent, if there is a refinery equivalent in terms of gas, because there are multiple streams of gas that come into it, and we are very proud to be a shareholder. I see that there will be more gas becoming available and the decision is now for ADNOC to determine the optimal solution to process this gas based on its gas master plan which may channeling through existing capacity at ADNOC Gas Processing. If it is ultra-sour gas and we have seen some of the new concessions that have just been announced which is the Ghasha gas to ENI, Wintershall and OMV, then we will probably require different sets of gas processing capacity. I can see a solution where the different gas processing plants can be utilized based on technical ranges and varying levels of (gas) “sourness“ whether it is ADNOC Gas Processing, ADNOC sour gas or a the new offshore ultra-sour gas hub as they will all have different requirements. Shell has deep experience and expertise in sour gas treatment both from an operational capability as well as technology deployment in non-Shell joint ventures that we support.</p><h4>Can you tell us about your engagement with the in-country value (ICV) program and what is your assessment on working closely with local SMEs?</h4><p>In-country value has been a well thought out program, it was great to see some of the vendors at ADIPEC displaying ICV certification on their booths. ADNOC are targeting a minimum of 40% local content, which is achievable given the supply chain base in country, and this number is set to increase over the years. As an international company we do not get involved in the tendering opportunities as its done by the operating companies through ADNOC procurement. We have however provided support to both ADNOC by sharing best practice from our JVs in the region.</p><h4>Can IOCs really hope to be taken seriously as players in the energy transition when so much public opinion is weighted against them, and oil production continues to increase globally? </h4><p>Shell is committed to the energy transition and our CEO is very visionary and wants to thrive in the transition. Shell is not a follower, we are a part of it, the BG acquisition is part of this strategy with specific ambitions for greenhouse emissions. Last year we released our Sky Scenario, which set out a path to achieving the COP 21 agenda by 2070. To get there, we will require more collaboration between government and private entities to achieve this. Shell has announced its aim to reduce the net carbon footprint by 20% by 2035 and by 50% by 2050 which is quite a significant ambition. Shell has also linked the executive pay to carbon reduction targets, making it a first in the industry to do so.</p><h4>What can be done to attract younger people and women into the energy industry?</h4><p>In general, Shell perhaps has a much younger workforce than others, but this is an issue in the industry. I remember when I was working for one of the energy services companies and the average age at the time in the early 2000s was 58 or 59. Therefore it is not a story that is built now but one that started a long time ago as every time there is boom and bust people leave the industry and few get replaced. However, Shell continues to recruit through the down cycle. Millennials want to work for employers who are committed to values and ethics, and given our commitment to playing a leading role in the energy transition where we are a lot more involved in gas and new energies businesses compared with others, this tends to attract more graduates. In terms of women in energy, as a father of three young girls yet to explore the world, gender balance and diversity at the work place is deeply rooted in my DNA and I am really proud that at Shell we have the industry's first female CFO. Can we do more as an industry, yes, we can! It's about providing the space to create the environment for female talent to develop their careers, and at Shell we are set on a journey to getting gender equality.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[thai-life]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did you start in Thailand, and what developments and ideas have you pursued in the real estate sector here?</h4><p>I'm originally from Sweden and first came to Thailand by chance when I was just 20 years old because the travel agent suggested that I should visit this beautiful tropical paradise. I just turned 37 years old in May 2019, so I've now been here for 17 years. These days, I am one of the largest real estate developers in Southern Thailand. At the moment, we're involved in a major development, building 1,700 apartments across Phuket. Almost 80% have already sold, so we're performing very well. I'm not the only one doing the hard work though, I have a fantastic team of architects, engineers, salespeople, and a marketing department, who all play major roles in my success. We currently have about 250 employees, who have been working on consecutive projects over the past 12 years. We've started new projects every other year, which have grown increasingly larger and we're delighted to have received several awards for being the best developer in Thailand with the best architecture design.</p><h4>Who are your main clients when it comes to foreign customers?</h4><p>Five to 10 years ago, most of our customers were Australians, Europeans, or Americans. However, over the past five years, we've been seeing more Chinese and Russian clients who are buying properties from us online without even coming to Thailand to view them. I have Chinese and Russian investors who have purchased five, 10, or even 15 units online. We've bolstered our reputation and developed trust by working with some of the biggest hotel groups in the world. Sometimes, when we finish our projects, leading hotel groups, such as Ramada or Best Western, take them over. When clients see these kinds of hoteliers working with us, it creates an atmosphere of trust. We're the only developer that works with such prominent brands in Southern Thailand because it is difficult to gain their trust; we've excelled in this and now people know us.</p><h4>How green are your projects? Is Blue Horizon focusing on being “futureproof?“ </h4><p>As a developer, I care about the environment surrounding our projects. I am a nature-oriented person at heart and love spending time out in the wild. Thailand has a lot of restrictions, rules, and regulations that must be followed, so we have to adapt to these regulations to preserve the environment, otherwise, this country will lose its charm. That's why 70% of each of our projects is composed of the units themselves and the other 30% is devoted to greenery and nature. People come to Thailand for the beautiful natural environment; the palm trees, the white sand beaches, the clear blue sea, the lush greenery, waterfalls, and the mountains. Therefore, we need to put in the effort to keep it that way. We're successful because we incorporate Thailand's natural assets into our projects as much as we can. Sometimes we lose a lot of space that we could have made more money on, but in the end, the integration of green space improves each project.</p><h4>What is your analysis of the real estate market in Thailand now?</h4><p>It's booming because we're in the right place at the right time. For the past 12 years, everyone's been saying each year that it will undergo a downturn, but we continue to prove them wrong. It comes down to supply and demand; every year we see tourism increase by 10 to 15% and the more people that visit Thailand, the more people will be interested in investing. Prices in Thailand are also much more affordable than in places such as Dubai, Sweden, or the US. Part of our success is also due to the fact that we mostly sell investment properties. There's not that much interest in residential property, but investment properties come with a 7% return guarantee, even if we don't rent them out. Nowadays, that's preferable to any bank, plus, investors get a holiday home to come to if they want to. That's why we continue to sell units. You could put your money in a bank and get a 1% return rate or you can put the money with us and get 7% plus a holiday home. It's a win-win situation.</p><h4>How are increasing digitalization and the use of artificial intelligence pertinent to your business?</h4><p>We've invested a lot of money in these areas over the past two years. One thing that has contributed to successful online sales is the implementation of VR systems that allow people to actually see and walk around the unit, even before the project is finished, so they can really get a feel for everything, which gives a little more credibility to buying online. Clients tend to buy in bulk to invest more and get a better return, especially Chinese and Russian investors. In China, people can't own anything in their own name, so when we offer them apartments they can buy and own entirely in Thailand, it's an extremely attractive option for them. They can own it forever and get a lucrative investment out of it. In fact, 60% of all the units we sold in 2018 and so far in 2019 have been to Chinese buyers.</p><h4>Could you tell us a bit about your recent book, Homeless to Billionaire?</h4><p>Homeless to Billionaire is an autobiography about my life. Previously, I didn't like discussing my life, but one of my mentors who I invited to Thailand to hold an onstage seminar with me was inspired after hearing my life story. He advised me to write a book because he felt that my story would benefit others. Without his input, I probably wouldn't have written the book. When I appeared onstage with him, he'd had a backdrop made of my face, advertising the seminar as a preview of my book, which we had not really spoken about at that point! Now, I'm really pleased that I wrote the book, even though it was a promise more than a goal I had. Later, I'd like to travel around the world inspiring others through seminars.</p><h4>Are you looking to expand outside of Thailand?</h4><p>I am always open to opportunities, but regarding expansion, you need to be discerning. I'm always getting offers from people all over the world reaching out to other investors and developers, but there has to be the right gut feeling for it to work. If the right offer for me arises, obviously, I'll go for it.</p><h4>What are your plans for the next 12 months?</h4><p>The main goal is to sell the remaining 20% of our inventory and we'll finish the Heavana project, which is set to become one of the biggest resorts ever built on Phuket Island and a milestone for us. My other goal is to travel around different countries with my mentors. Together, we want to motivate and empower others to improve their lives. I also have a big book tour coming up in the US and I'll be traveling to many states to promote Homeless to Billionaire.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Engagement Program of the Year]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[marco-winter-executive-director-malaysian-dutch-business-council]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main recent highlights and achievements of MDBC?</h4><p>In 2018, MDBC won the APAC 2018 International Chambers of Commerce Membership Engagement Program of the Year Awards. This year, we were recognized as one of the top Dutch chambers in the world, being only the second to receive the NLinBusiness quality mark at an accreditation ceremony held in the presence of the Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs, HE Stef Blok. We surpassed the milestone of 1,000 placed students for our Student Internship Program (SIP) last year and continue to grow the program. We continue to see a growth in memberships from 40 in 2003 to nearly 300 in 2019.</p><h4>What is the scope of services you provide to your members?</h4><p>MDBC provides business services, representation, and networking for all members and businesses with Malaysian-Dutch links. Oftentimes, Dutch entrepreneurs looking to enter the Malaysian market will approach us. We guide them in the set-up process and put them in touch with the necessary local authorities and our members who provide a wide variety of services—everything from corporate secretariat, flexible work spaces, and relocation services to branding, and logistics support, to name just a few. We also directly offer visa services, career services, and provide our member companies with Dutch student interns through our SIP to aid them on special projects. Additionally, as Malaysia is a relationship-based business environment, we help them establish these relationships at the frequent informative and networking events that we organize. MDBC is recognized as one of the most active business councils in Malaysia, so there is ample opportunity for networking. With chapters in Penang and Johor, we are able to provide these services and networking opportunities even for organizations located in the northern and southern regions of the country. With our colleague, bilateral chambers, MDBC also does lobbying for our members as and when issues arise in the business community. With a collective presence, we can more effectively bring these issues and concerns of the Malaysian Dutch business community to the Malaysian government, often resulting in a quicker resolution.</p><h4>Could you tell us more about your NLinBusiness accreditation and the opportunities it creates?</h4><p>MDBC is the second Dutch chamber in the world to receive the NLinBusiness quality mark. In addition to being acknowledged as a 'best-in-class' leader, it is a sign to Dutch entrepreneurs that they can be guaranteed a 'soft landing' in Malaysia as they seek to enter the Malaysian and/or wider ASEAN market. The accreditation will also help raise our exposure among Dutch entrepreneurs worldwide; any looking to enter the Malaysian or wider ASEAN market know that they have a robust, active, and knowledgeable organization on their side.</p><h4>How do you assess the importance of the ASEAN region, and in particular Malaysia, for the Netherlands?</h4><p>ASEAN, and Malaysia, are growing in importance to the Netherlands. The Netherlands' Ministry of Economic Affairs has now placed ASEAN-5 (Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam) in second spot, only behind China, in its ranking of priority countries and regions. With a combined GDP of USD2.63 trillion and a fast-growing market of over 630 million consumers, the ASEAN market is a dynamic one. It provides interesting business opportunities for Dutch companies in a wide variety of areas. Within that, Malaysia is a significant market for the Netherlands. In 2018, trade between the Netherlands and Malaysia amounted to a total of EUR7.87 billion. Dutch investments in Malaysia increased with impressive numbers in 2018. Malaysia remains an important market for Dutch machinery and transport equipment, with an export value of EUR493 million in 2018. It is also a popular export destination for Dutch food products and live animals, which reached a value of EUR154 million in 2018, or 14% of total exports. Dairy exports, among them, increased 44% to an amount of EUR25 million, EUR29 million worth of Dutch vegetables and fruit, and EUR19 million worth of Dutch meat and meat preparations found their way to Malaysia in 2018. It also remains an important export destination for petroleum (EUR156 million) and chemicals (EUR129 million) from the Netherlands. With these numbers, Malaysia remains the second-largest trading partner of The Netherlands within ASEAN, leaving only Singapore ahead as the regional transshipment hub.  </p><h4>How does MDBC collaborate with other Dutch Chambers in the ASEAN region to facilitate regional business?</h4><p>MDBC is one of the founders of the ASEAN Dutch Chamber Network (ADCN), a collaboration that consists of six Dutch Chambers of Commerce—Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam—that represent a diverse range of Dutch businesses in the region. Within ADCN, we share best practices. Since this year, ADCN has been developing some common exposure, highlighting our activities and events to entrepreneurs in the Netherlands, better streamlining of membership, and providing increased opportunities for respective members to attend events from Dutch chamber colleagues that could especially be of interest for many regional representatives in ASEAN.  </p><h4>How do you assess the ease of doing business in Malaysia for Dutch investors, and what are the focus areas for further improving Malaysia's investment climate?</h4><p>Dutch investors benefit from the access that Malaysia provides to a much wider region, and there are similarities between the Netherlands' role in the EU and Malaysia's role in ASEAN. These past 10-15 years, significant improvements have been made in the ease of doing business in Malaysia, and the country has the rankings to prove it. Organizations such as MIDA, MDEC, and TalentCorp, together with the various state investment agencies and economic corridors, have all provided substantial support to foreign investors. At times, on a federal and state level, it might not be totally clear what the roles and benefits of these many agencies are, so their authority and scope of work have to be presented stronger. As chambers, we have emphasized to the new government the importance of consistency in matters that effect trade and investments; certain laws and guidelines have to be maintained, or for any proposed changes there should first be a dialog with the corporate sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4></h4><h4><a href="https://dunncox.com/"></a>Which sector is most in need of FDI in Jamaica?</h4><p>Medicinal marijuana with the support of the CLA (Cannabis Licensing Authority) is a sector with an enormous potential in the export market. There are two additional sectors which have been growing as well, they are the business process outsourcing (BPO) and the trans-shipment sector. With the widening of the Panama Canal, there are several opportunities for Jamaica to act as a sorter or assembler of goods for the north American market.</p><h4>What are the most promising sectors for growth in the country?</h4><p>Infrastructure is very important, especially the road network, sewage and water systems. These are mainly in the corporate area and are called our heritage project, as they are supposed to last us for the next 40 years. This goes along with solving the traffic situation and improve the services which would result in an increased density in housing. These improvements will allow the city planners to be able to approve high rise buildings beyond that which was available in the past such as 10 and 20 story buildings. In the case of tourism, which in percentage terms may not grow as much as the other sectors, but the potential remains to create the greatest increase in the number of jobs.  Now, there are also expansion plans for Jamaica's two major highways, north-south and east-west, and also the proposed improvement in the highway to St Thomas. These improvements would result in a highway ring around the island. A likely benefit from the improvement could be the greater utilization of our land for agriculture.</p><h4>How important is it to invest and diversify your portfolio in Jamaica?</h4><p>The macro developments have been vital when it comes to reducing debt to GDP ratio, interest rates low and stable currency. It is to be noted that in the last 5 years, the Jamaican stock exchange has been the highest performing stock exchange in the world. For years Banks, pension schemes and a number of financial institutions depended on the high interest rate regime to guarantee returns on their investments. As returns on deposits are now very low, in some instances less than 2% it cannot be over emphasized how important it is to diversify in to stocks, manufacturing, tourism and other areas of investment. It is important to mention that, we also have a strong and reliable court system, as Jamaica has been increasing the number of judges and introducing new technologies to the system. Also, arbitration is a growing area and we have trained arbitrators in recent years, with an increasing number of arbitrators entering the job market.</p><h4>How is DunnCox committed to local and international companies doing business in Jamaica?</h4><p>As one of the leading Law Firms in Jamaica we've been around for more than 75 years and we are proud of our record of service both to our local and international companies.  In a number of the major transactions taking place in the island, we have acted in the divestment of a major port, in the conversion from oil to solar energy by the largest supplier of electricity in the island. Also, we have participated in the restoration of a number of our bauxite and alumina producing companies to name a few. Additionally, we have also been active in the divestment and raising of funds for local companies on the stock exchange. This is by no means an exhaustive list of our services as we continue to serve our local and foreign clients.</p><h4>What is the role of DunnCox to help companies succeed in Jamaica's business environment?</h4><p>Every country is unique in its requirements for doing business. Jamaica has been trying for a number of years to reduce the red tape in doing business and to improve its ranking in the global index of doing business. What we do at DunnCox is to try explain the difficulties the clients will encounter and try to  guide them in the most efficient way to approach their objective. In a number of instances this involves interfacing and intervening on behalf of clients with representatives of the Government on a timely basis. In all instances the objective is to achieve what is best for the client in the shortest possible time.</p><h4>How is DunnCox prepared for new digital companies?</h4><p>DunnCox has embarked on a multi-million-dollar project this year to change to fiber optic cables and move all emails to the cloud. We are introducing new and improved technologies to be able to offer our clients greater transparency in the billing process and in our recording systems. There are many software and hardware upgrades going on, at enormous costs, and we believe it is going to push us ahead of the competition by five-10 years.</p><h4>What are your goals for 2019?</h4><p>Fundamentally, our goal is to give greater service to our clients at a lower cost, and to be a part of facilitating the legal and economic upgrades in our legal system. We want to participate in a number of outreach programs to alleviate poverty and to facilitate greater transparency in our political system. Finally, we want to grow our firm, which has been growing at a reasonably strong rate. The attorneys in the firm serve a number of legal and civic bodies working towards greater efficiency and accountability in improving our democracy and transparency in the business world.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<url><![CDATA[abdulaziz-alshehri-director-infinity-aviation-academy]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you walk us through the milestones since Infinity Aviation Academy's establishment in 2010?</h4><p>When Alpha Star was established, it had government contracts to support the public sector, and all its customers came through the government. By 2015, when we started expanding, the decision was made to maintain Alpha Star to support the government and. When we won a government helicopter maintenance contract with the Saudi Ministry of Interior (MoI), we questioned why we did not pursue a contract for the entire support role, which included training. It had been sending its pilots to the US for training, with all the difficulties that go along with that, such as visas, logistics, and availability. We put forward a proposal to accommodate the flight simulator here and provide all the required training. Currently, we have an ongoing agreement with MoI for training at Infinity Aviation Academy. For any training we do not offer here, we arrange it elsewhere. We have a great relationship with other training centers around the world and sometimes send people overseas for training and reclaim the cost from the government later. All training programs are delivered in-house, and all our materials and instructors are certified by General Authority of Civil Aviation (GACA). For new customers, we go through a process to determine their training requirements and customize our standard curriculum.</p><h4>Could you tell us more about the accreditation you received to perform your training courses?</h4><p>No aviation company can work without a training department, because that department makes sure everyone meets the requirements of the various authorities, such as the Civil Aviation Authority GACA. When the authorities issue the certificate for the business, they give the company the requirements for their pilots, mechanics, cabin crew, and other staff. To maintain their certificates and perform their duties, the company and their staff have to meet these requirements. The training department is in charge of ensuring this happens. This means creating a training schedule and systems to evaluate and monitor, in addition to conducting the training required by GACA in-house. When we expanded and established Infinity Aviation Academy, we created another core business teaching non-employees. Now, we have agreements with certain governments to teach their pilots. They send their pilots to Infinity Aviation Academy for initial, ongoing, or advanced courses, and we do this for both the commercial aviation industry and the military. We have been certified as the first training center for rotary wing aircraft, which requires going through many processes with GACA with full success.</p><h4>Which direction is Infinity Aviation Academy heading toward in line with the latest trends in demand for aviation training?</h4><p>The first step we do is a study of the potential business in the market we work in. In an aviation study, we calculate the figures and come up with the advantages or disadvantages of a business line. Infinity Aviation Academy is owned by PIF, and we are looking for growth on a smooth trajectory. By doing that, any additional revenue creates a reasonable mid-ranged net profit, and we can continue to run. Once we build up our name and introduce our services such that everyone knows the quality we offer, this is where we grab the customers. In our line of business, most of the customers around the world know each other, and if they have a bad experience with a particular supplier, others will stop using that service as well. We try to firstly maintain our contract with government to meet vision 2030 and perform outstandingly to exceed its expectations. We provide it with everything it needs so it does not have to handle any of it. In addition, we do a great deal of consultation work for MoI about how to build its training for technicians, pilots, and crew. It is pleased and trusts us, and we take this workload off its shoulders. Today, we receive numerous requests from companies around the world that want to work with us. In France, we met with four major companies looking to work us for pilot training. Setting up a training facility takes a great deal of time, including at least 18 months for the factory to deliver the simulator units, another month for installation and testing, and a year to get certified if there are no issues. There is only one shortcut, which is bringing in units to an existing facility that is already certified, which is what companies can do with us. At the end of 2019, we should host three simulators. We base our workload on the number of airplanes and pilots in the Kingdom because these figures control the feasibility of the business. By studying these numbers, we can work out how many training hours and shifts we can work and then commit to training in advance. We have to deliver between 6,500 to 10,000 hours of training on a unit to make it profitable. We also look to create partnerships locally and forge synergies with other PIF companies. In 2030, PIF will have the lead of all aviation companies, and we need to work together and support each other to create strong companies in each fleet and niche of the aviation industry, be it maintenance, training, rotary wing, or fixed wing. Just locally, the market is enormous, including private and government aviation combined. Aside from government, there are thousands of pilots in the Royal Saudi Air Force and Royal Saudi Army and Navy, the Border Security, Medivac, and all the private aviation companies. On top of this, we rent our units to companies that want to bring in their own instructors for company-specific training for their pilots using our facilities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

We offer spaces where people can work, eat, receive medical attention, enjoy, and so on. Our buildings are Real Shared Benefits Colaborative Communities where people reach their goals making networking and business relationships. For example, Azuna Cancún, which has 16 floors for offices, four floors for medical offices, and four floors for commercial spaces. Another example is Centralia Cancún, a mixed use development which includes offices, a commercial and services plaza, a hotel, and an industrial park with buildings that can be adapted into industrial offices. These industrial offices are modern premises, for the production industry where in the same place there can be production capacity as well as a sales show room or an office. Our project offices are located in Monterrey, Hermosillo, Querétaro, Mérida, and Cancún coordinating projects in seven cities.</p><h4>Given Mexico's highly competitive environment in the real estate market, how can developers work to differentiate their services?</h4><p>Grupo Cápitel throughout its five subsidiaries offers the  “CÁPITEL 360° Service" which is an Integrated Real Estate Service that starts form land acquisition, to the operation, occupation and management of real estate space. Cápitel Desarrollos develops the projects, from land acquisition to the first round sales. Cápitel Properties runs a real estate investment fund and  leased assets. Cápitel Connect, is a marketing and real estate brokerage company that commercializes both its own and third-party buildings. Redwood Property Management is a property management company that helps increase the property value by managing the properties operation and keeping high occupancy. Last but not least, NEX Offices, our Business and Coworking Space Centers, where we offer serviced offices for lease including co-working spaces and virtual offices in our six centers in four cities. By 2020 well have at least three new Centers in Cancún and San Luis Potosí­, and Monterrey. Our mission is to develop high quality real estate that increases value for its owners and quality of life to all that are involved and visit them.  This allows us to keep developing back to back projects with high returns to our investors. The last 15 projects we have done in the last 10 years have produced a yearly ROI of  23% on average and an average occupancy of 94.7%.</p><h4>What is the approach of Cápitel Desarrollos in Monterrey, one of Mexico's largest cities?</h4><p>Grupo Cápitel is constantly looking for unattended markets. Monterrey, being as big as it is, has many opportunities. Nevertheless, it has many saturated zones. For example there is what we call Valle Oriente known for its commercial plazas and luxury office and apartment buildings. Experts say that Valle Oriente has a luxury offices inventory that can supply demand for at least three years. In Cápitel we look for untended markets. A perfect example is Azuna Monterrey our newest  mixed-use project in the south of Monterrey which include commercial and services plaza, office and medical spaces and apartments.  Moreover, we are developing a mixed use development in the heart of the industrial zone of the north of Monterrey. This project in a 17,000sqm lot will offer offices, plaza, medical spaces and a hotel. Cápitel already has the land for the next two projects in Monterrey.</p><h4>How will new developments complement the current administration's efforts to diversify economic development throughout Mexico?</h4><p>We believe that a city must grow in every economic sector in order to find balance. Mexican president Lopez Obrador's vision focuses on developing the entire country and not just specific cities. This means that southern Mexico will see a major boost during this administration. Cápitel Desarrollos is already present in two of the biggest southern cities with plans to continue developing there. As with every new presidential administration, we must be cautious with our development strategies, investment, and processes. Cápitel Desarrollos seeks to develop projects with good design and at the best possible price to satisfy the market's needs.</p><h4>Which segments within the real estate sector will be further promoted to attract the attention of international investors?</h4><p>Mexico's real estate sector offers great opportunities for foreign investors. Investing in a property that generates long-term profits is good business. Given the US Dollar's strength against the Mexican peso, it is highly recommended to invest in office space and retail for lease.  To give an example, The Black Creek Group is a fund that handles USD13 billion of investments in Mexico. It is the largest real estate investor in Mexico, and according to them now is the time to invest in Mexico.  Also expert say that now is the time to invest in high volume apartments for lease.  The middle class in Mexico has remained solid with strong purchasing power. Notably, Mexico has an interesting financial platform due to credit institutions like INFONAVIT. All sectors of real estate in Mexico have great potential.</p><h4>What are Cápitel Desarrollos' plans for 2019-2020?</h4><p>As of right now, we have four projects under development, and two different ones are about to start. Moreover, we have land reserves that can hold at least four new mixed use developments. These six projects will be completed between 2019 and 2020. Grupo Cápitel wants to continue growing. We make strategic alliances in the cities where we are, and we want to keep in touch with the governments to continue with their help, developing high quality urban infrastructure for the local communities. Cápitel will continue to serve unattended markets, bringing smart and connected buildings to people across Mexico. That is what Cápitel has been doing for many years, and is our intention to continue by helping improve quality of life through real estate development.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is Unilever actively improving daily lives of Kuwaitis? </h4><p>Contributing to the improved health and wellbeing of communities is a key priority for Unilever, and one of the main pillars of the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan (the Plan), whereby we have committed to improving the health and wellbeing of up to 1 billion people globally by 2020. Since the inception of the Plan in 2012, in the Gulf region, we have educated over 5 million people on hand and oral hygiene via our Signal &amp; Lifebuoy oral and handwashing programs. Additionally, Omo is advocating for experiential play for children via its 'Right to Play' Campaign given that research has shown that children in MENA spend less than 1 hour of playtime outdoors due to increased time spent on digital devices. The Omo “Dirt is good" campaign encourages children to spend more time outdoors, resulting in improved learning, while freeing up time for mothers by offering superior clothes cleaning. With regards to our Foods &amp; Beverages portfolio, we are committed to making products that are both enjoyable and healthy, while also helping address some of the world's most pressing public health challenges, including the double burden of over- and under-nutrition. Since end-2018 we have taken out trans-fat completely from our products, while 100% of our ice cream portfolio has less than 25g of sugar per portion and 59% of our portfolio meets the highest nutritional standards. In our personal care category, we have launched several items inspired by natural elements.</p><h4>In what ways is Unilever working toward halving its environmental footprint by 2030? </h4><p>Our vision aims to decouple our growth from our environmental footprint while increasing our positive social impact. Our Lipton Tea Factory located in the Jebel Ali Free Zone in Dubai was the first manufacturing site in the UAE to send 'Zero waste to landfill' for non-hazardous waste. Additionally, our Dubai Personal Care Manufacturing Facility was one of the first factories in the region to have both solar photovoltaic and solar thermal systems, totaling up to 2MW of power generation. We also educate customers on the need for water conservation. Held in partnership with DEWA &amp; SEWA, our 'water saver' initiative educated 7.25 million consumers between 2012 and 2015. Notably, we have partnered up with Re-Food Kuwait, a not-for-profit organization that takes products nearing expiry and distributes it to people in need.</p><h4>What actions have been taken in Kuwait toward an increased inclusion of females in the workplace? </h4><p>Unilever is a strong believer in the fact that women's empowerment is one of the most important enablers of sustainable human development and economic growth. Our global target is to empower 5 million women by 2020. Internally, since 2009, globally we have committed to building a gender-balanced organization and set a clear ambition to have 50% women in management positions by 2020. By end of 2018, 49% of our managers globally were women. Our progress in MENA too has been strong with women today forming around 34% of our management workforce — a 68% increase since 2011. Moreover, female participation in our Senior Management in MENA increased from 9% in 2011 to 25% in 2018.</p><h4>How can Unilever support SME's locally? </h4><p>Unilever, along with its local partners in Kuwait support local small business, and can help by providing a line of credit, in addition to branding and/or activation which depends on the activity of the small business. Of course, all such SME's sign up to our business codes, and we ensue that their operations support fair play principles.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>In general, I expect market growth given the approach of the Dubai Expo 2020 and WC2022 and which in my opinion will impact Kuwait positively. I also expect the e-commerce sector to grow further, which will help the sector grow overall. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[playing-catch-up]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the luxury sector evolved in Kuwait in recent years? </h4><p>The luxury sector in Kuwait has rapidly evolved over the last decade. Malls are full of all major international brands, and the biggest global department stores such as Harvey Nichols and Bloomingdales have also expanded significantly in the region. In general, the entire region experienced YoY growth until the significant drop in oil prices, which acted as a reality check for countries heavily dependent on oil. At present, wealthy millennials are reshaping the luxury sector in different ways. Today's consumer looks for an experience rather than the product. In addition, high street brands are being mixed with luxury brands. For example, fashion influencers are mixing brands such as Adidas and Zara with YSL and Gucci. In short, I believe the luxury industry worldwide is changing rapidly. Moreover, e-commerce has changed the market, and people are more on the lookout for better deals; consumers have also become more educated. There are many e-commerce companies abroad that are now allowed to ship to Kuwait. This will represent a challenge for the local sellers, and we have already started to feel the impact. The market in Kuwait is shrinking compared to the last few years, but not as much as the rest of the GCC. For example, compared to Dubai, we are not reliant on tourism. Local purchasing power is quite strong, and the country has a solid middle class. The country's formidable relationship with Qatar and Saudi Arabia also presents an advantage. In addition, Kuwait is one of the few remaining countries that have not implemented 5% VAT. That means products sold here remain competitive on a regional scale. Nevertheless, it will be important to adapt and keep in pace with latest developments, such an e-commerce platform. With numerous promotional activities, we can ensure that our e-commerce prices remain close to Europe and the US. The consumer is knowledgeable, and is aware of the alternatives that are available elsewhere. Also, younger consumers' behavior has evolved in a new direction. Companies have to be relatable, maintain quality, and be trendy. Beidoun is still opening malls and big stores, so we still have reason to remain optimistic, but Kuwaitis are definitely becoming more price sensitive. </p><h4>What are the main factors that you consider before deciding to introduce a new brand in the Kuwaiti market?</h4><p>First and foremost, it is important to find market gaps. We have definitely become more selective  and adopted a more exhaustive market research. In fact, we have intensively used social media in order to conduct our market research; the market is changing at a fast pace. When it comes to perfumes and cosmetics, there are a number of niche brands coming into the market. People want to differentiate themselves; the niche segment is therefore growing significantly. In the cosmetic sector, young US-based brands are taking market share away from the traditional brands.  </p><h4>In what ways is the company reinventing itself to relate to its customers and expand its clientele?     </h4><p>Ours was one of the first e-commerce platforms for cosmetics in the region. In Kuwait, social media influencers and digital marketing have a tremendous impact on consumers, and we are focusing on that medium. When it comes to brick and mortar, we are closing down the traditional concepts and shifting our focus toward our niche and novelties portfolio.</p><h4>How is the creation and implementation of online stores impacting the company's finances? </h4><p>In general, the region is at its early stages when it comes to e-commerce, especially when compared to countries such as the US and the UK. When it comes to the luxury e-commerce market in the region, the market is growing. However, it still needs some time to catch up with the rest of the world. The consumer still likes to touch and feel products, so e-commerce has not developed that much when it comes to luxury products in Kuwait. In the next five to seven years, we remain hopeful that it will reach 15-20% of our business. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been key for AAW to establish major business relationships with brands in consumer goods, pharmaceuticals, and other fields? </h4><p>Our company's core values were key in establishing and sustaining such relationships. From the beginning until now, our company has been known for its high level of integrity, transparency, and commitment to excellence. This has been the key reason why this company has continued to grow all these years. Multinational companies not only look for partners with good values, but also with ones that enjoy a proven track record of good performance. Our partners, therefore, see AAW as a dependable company with high standards.</p><h4>How is AAW managing to integrate all its business lines and maintaining the highest level of competitiveness in the market? </h4><p>The market is constantly evolving and this creates new competition. In order for us to be on top of our game, we run our business in a highly efficient manner. We took a bold but important decision many years back to build a distribution center that consolidated all of AAW's business units under one roof. At present, that distribution center is considered one of the biggest in the country. Investing in e-commerce at a relatively early stage also helped us grab more market share. Finally, our data-driven strategy has helped us anticipate new trends or changes in the market and enabled us to move faster than our peers.</p><h4>Which one of your business lines has experienced the most significant growth and why?</h4><p>We have experienced great growth in multiple lines of our business over the past few years. The retail part of our business and specifically the pharmaceutical (Roche, Merk) and outdoor (The North Face, Patagonia, Vans) business units have been enjoying good retail growth. We have also rolled out multiple showrooms for our kitchens and home appliances business (Bosch, Nolte) and so far, that step has produced great results. On the wholesale part, our FMCG business unit (P&amp;G, Clorox, Hershey's) continues to grow its market share despite the challenges in the market. Our e-commerce business is also showing promising potential. Last but not least, our real estate business has always been one of the great performers. Notably, our kitchens and home appliances business unit has been aggressively closing many contracts and gaining serious market share. On the other hand, our home and office furniture business unit has encountered some challenges due to fierce competition and severe market fragmentation. We have responded by partnering with Jysk, one of the fastest-growing furniture brands in the world, and have started to roll out multiple locations. </p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead in terms of growth and business? </h4><p>The retail market in Kuwait has suffered over the past five to six years. By the beginning of 2018, we felt that the market slightly initiated its recovering process. Consumer confidence still seems shaky but it is improving. In 2019, so far, we have witnessed our online business booming across all our business units. We also see the unrolling of public- and private-sector projects, which will positively impact our business. We are optimistic about the year ahead, and our financials and independent market reports indicate that we are on the right track. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does The Scientific Center Kuwait play in the diversification of the economy, and more specifically, the tourism sector?</h4><p>Many things are still at the beginning of the implementation phase or planning phase when it comes to Vision 2030. Tourism is still in the planning phase. If Kuwait is serious about tourism, there are many elements that need to come in to service people and increase the attractiveness of Kuwait within the GCC. There are certain areas of Kuwait that appeal to people, including food and beverage, fashion, and culture. There is enough pull, especially from countries such as Saudi Arabia, where people like to visit Kuwait. In terms of tourism, the Scientific Center Kuwait resonates well with families looking to spend time in a cultural space with their kids. Since its inception, the Scientific Center has had a differentiated standing because of its unique offering on a regional level; there was no other science center. Not only were we the first, but for quite some time the only one. We continue to receive tourists, especially if we develop and change our themes in the center. This would be our contribution to attracting tourists.</p><h4>What other areas could be further developed in Kuwait to attract more tourists and a wider international scope?</h4><p>Different infrastructure is necessary. Hotels in Kuwait mostly target regional and Islamic tourists. Another target point is visas and airports. Many countries are not allowed to visit Kuwait without an invitation. Should that change, there are several sectors that could develop positively, the first being hotels and resorts. We have beautiful beaches in Kuwait that have not seen their true potential because there is no infrastructure or strategic development focused on services. Transportation is another sector that needs development in order to impact tourism and the experience of tourists. </p><h4>In which ways are you showing your rich cultural history to Kuwaitis and non-Kuwaitis?</h4><p>When visitors enter the center, they see modernity, though it is deeply embedded in traditional architecture on the walls and in the exhibits in different ways. The arches depict tents, and within the attractions there are other elements from our history. That is fairly uncommon in a science center. When one enters some of the attractions, such as the aquarium, they are taken on a journey through our history. </p><h4>What are you doing to increase the number of visitors at the center while maintaining a high level of quality?</h4><p>We are working on many facets, one of which is understanding our customers better. That happens by doing a great deal of analysis behind the scenes. We also conduct surveys; our employees go around with iPads asking visitors about their experience, such as things they want to see, things they would change, and things they already like. From there, we look into the responses to determine any pivots or visitor experience points that need adjustment. For example, it may be via introducing new IMAX films, conducting different kinds of activities, and so on. In the end, our focus is on the customer perspective more than ever before. We want to understand what encourages people to return repeatedly and have a positive experience every time. We emphasize our loyalty and membership programs. Our aim is to have every visitor experience the center three to five times per year. Children who visit science centers when they are young are more likely to understand science, mathematics, and engineering because they have been exposed at an early age.  </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In what ways is Jumeirah working into constantly providing a unique experience to its customers?</h4><p>Exceeding guests' expectations by delivering the Jumeirah “Stay Different" experience at any visit is definitely our secret to success in providing unique and personalized premium experience to all our guests. We seek to etch into our guests' minds unforgettable memories in every visit to Kuwait's idyllic resort. Jumeirah Messilah Beach Hotel &amp; Spa celebrated a number of milestones in 2018 as it continues to set the standards as leaders in hospitality. It was an honor to collect more than 10 awards including the Best International Luxury Hotel Resort Chain 2018, Luxury Family Friendly Hotel of the Year 2018, and Leading Business Hotel. In addition, our renowned Talise Spa, signature Steakhouse Pepper, and Olio restaurant all collect awards. These awards are a testament to the hard work of our teams across the property and our commitment to high-quality service, luxury, and overall customer experience.</p><h4>How is Jumeirah working on differentiating itself from the competition in Kuwait?</h4><p>Jumeirah Messilah Beach Hotel &amp; Spa comes as a first choice for leisure and business alike. Catered to every need and want, the hotel's hybrid design of both contemporary and traditionally cultural elegance offers a wide variety of 407 rooms and suites. Currently, we are working on turning some of king-sized bedrooms to twin rooms to accommodate more business clients and teams. We have a prime location as a resort, and guests can enjoy our 200m of private beach, the perfect place for sporting enthusiasts, in addition to the other hotel leisure facilities. When it comes to culinary, we have it all. Our restaurants feature beyond thriving cuisine choices with variety of international cuisines. Also, Jumeirah's signature Talise Spa, Kuwait's most prestigious spa covering 3,500sqm with 19 treatment rooms, offers a diversity of treatments. Furthermore, we continue to bring in diverse talents that contribute to constantly enhancing our competitive edge in the market. These are some of our strongest unique selling points.</p><h4>What challenges in the sector do you expect in the next three years?</h4><p>Kuwait's hotel sector is in line with the global challenges. In the past few years, the country witnessed large increase in investments with the opening of new hotels in different areas while the targeted customers, mainly the accommodation market, is not growing. This posed increasing challenges on occupancy rates and the average hotel room profits. However, the strong competition in the marketplace and the challenges it brings offer us an opportunity to innovate, think outside the box, and outgrow our current success to reach further heights.</p><h4>To what extent will the progressive opening of KSA impact the affluence of Saudi tourists in Kuwait?</h4><p>We continue to focus on our target markets to attract more guests to experience the “Stay Different" in Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia is on top of our list. A large percentage of Jumeirah Messilah Beach Hotel &amp; Spa's guests visit from the domestic market including Saudi Arabia, with an equal proportion from the leisure and corporate sectors. During the weekends, Jumeirah Messilah Beach Hotel &amp; Spa becomes a popular destination with families from Saudi Arabia, looking for a different get away from their daily routines. The hotel's facilities such as our swimming pools, spa, and kids club accommodate to the needs of families, while the villas provide families with access to private pools for extended privacy and comfort. Brand loyalty and Jumeirah's personalized services always attracts guests back to the hotel.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>We are always working hard to exceed guests' expectations by delivering the Jumeirah “Stay Different" experience. We will continue to drive new initiatives and promotions to accommodate their needs and demands in our efforts to maintain our position as the leading hotel in Kuwait. We strive to ensure that we have something to appeal to all tastes and provide a holistic luxury travel experience. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In what category would you place the Regency within the sector?</h4><p>The Regency is renowned across the entire Gulf region for its unrivaled conference and banqueting facilities, which altogether span over 8,000sqm. The Regency Kuwait Hotel has features that are second to none, such as its two exclusive private beaches and five pools, with one of each exclusive for our female customers who prefer privacy. There are extensive fine-dining facilities as well as fitness options available to our guests. I would define The Regency as a leading luxury boutique estate rather than comparing it to other conventional hotels. Our style is a fusion of classic taste and Arabic heritage, founded upon a nearly 40-year long tradition of hospitality. Our Kuwaiti hospitality heritage and individual branding are as much part of our niche as the design and décor of the hotel itself.</p><h4>What specific initiatives is The Regency implementing to differentiate itself from other luxury hotels?</h4><p>We recently launched a program named ValYou, which will assist in better tailoring the services we provide for our guests to improve customer loyalty and ensure that the value added for each individual guest is optimal, further justifying our rates. At the same time, we are launching training programs held by hired-in coaches, online university courses, and tailor-made classroom sessions across levels of our organization in order to ensure that our staff, both beginners and long-serving members, are constantly learning and improving so we can deliver the highest standards possible.</p><h4>Have you noticed any change in consumer behavior within the past few years?</h4><p>The process of traveling has simplified significantly in recent years. For example, people can just book online and arrive at their destination. Similarly, while traveling, consumers have experiences that are unavailable in their home country and return with new demands. This phenomenon has led to an elevation of expectations in terms of food, service, room quality, and the overall guest experience. The new trend now appears to be around socializing rather than just going outside to have a meal. Millennials, especially, travel often and have experienced the two extremes of luxury and basic accommodation, which has undoubtedly altered the demand in this sector.</p><h4>What projects does the Regency have in the next 12 months?</h4><p>We rebranded the hotel in 2018 with a new line of collateral, prints, and pictures. We are currently re-carpeting the entire hotel and have ordered new chinaware for the Al Liwan Lobby, which will arrive in early 2019. We are constantly working on unique and novel ways to improve our guest experience; the time our visitors stay with us must be as exceptional, as has been the case for the past 38 years. A hotel of such grandeur cannot be judged, however, on our future projects alone. Besides investing into new TV sets in all rooms and the implementation of a new security management system to ensure the highest level of security, it is our longstanding traditional values and our caring employees that ensure we maintain our position as the leading luxury hotel in Kuwait. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What makes Four Seasons an attractive destination for business and leisure? </h4><p>Defined by a new standard of innovative modern architecture and high-style design, Four Seasons Hotel Kuwait at Burj Alshaya is the glamorous new centerpiece of Kuwait City. Positioned in a prime central location, this is a magnetic gathering place for the city's business and social elite alike, offering a new experience of luxury in the city to those with a taste for the finest in life, as well as the most exciting destinations for dining, spa, weddings, and business events. Thoughtful care leads to an elevated level of service, making both residents and visitors feel right at home. </p><h4>How is Four Seasons applying its international standards of excellence and experience in order to provide its customers with an outstanding customer service? </h4><p>Our people create the experiences that define our brand. It is their commitment to excellence and genuine care for our guests that drives the success of Four Seasons and that is why we invest so heavily in recruiting, retaining, and developing the best. We believe that our level of personalization, recognition, and the attention to detail makes Four Seasons properties so appealing among discerning travelers, who will find a welcome home in Kuwait, where we will make each guest's experience truly unforgettable. Today, we have more than 500 employees with 50 different nationalities working at the Four Seasons Hotel Kuwait at Burj Alshaya, making sure that your experience at the hotel is all about you and crafted in accordance to your needs.</p><h4>How is Kuwait tourism performing in comparison to its neighboring countries? </h4><p>The luxury hotel sector is continuing to evolve to meet the growing aspirations of guests from around the world. This shift is more evident with travelers from the Middle East who are increasingly making decisions on destinations based on food. Another major trend that we see now these days is the expansion of foodie culture within the region, particularly in the Gulf. I can tell from what I have witnessed in terms of new developments in the local food and beverage scene, that Kuwait City is on its way to become the world's food capital by 2030. </p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead? </h4><p>I believe that Kuwait has much to offer business and leisure travelers, and our concierge team will be eager to advise both local and international visitors on the experiences we recommend. With two ballrooms at our property, as well as a range of conference and banqueting rooms able to welcome up to 2,000 people, one element of our approach is to promote the MICE segment, which is a huge opportunity for Kuwait, including weddings and entertainment events that will attract leisure visitors into town. Exceptional service is one of the key distinguishing factors of the Four Seasons brand and one that has led to the creation of an ever-growing pool of loyal guests for whom Four Seasons will always remain the hospitality brand of choice. Positioned in a prime central location, Four Seasons Hotel Kuwait is a magnetic gathering place for the city's business and social elite alike, offering a new experience of an elite lifestyle in the city, as well as the most exciting destination for dining, spa, weddings, and business events. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has consumer behavior and people's receptiveness to mass advertisement evolved?</h4><p>There have been a number of stages that have had a large impact on this evolution. A decade ago, the basic tools were outdoor and publication-based advertising; 90% of the budget was spent on this aspect of the business, and 10% was spread across other miscellaneous advertising tools, such as mall and interactive advertising and event sponsorship. When we started our business in 2008, we came up with solutions to advertising in malls. We focused on the top five or six malls in the country, because opportunities were there. We realized we could target customers in malls and get direct feedback, where that solution was cost-effective, reduce companies' spending up to 85%, and put us on the top list of the best substitute that offered higher and more effective exposure with better return on investment. We kept working gradually until we reached a point where clients see the benefit of advertising in malls. The expenditure grew from 10 million to 30 million within four years.</p><h4>What new technologies will be implemented in the near future?</h4><p>Now we are developing a new software for our screens' circuit that will allow us to have better centralized control over media development and deployment. This software will increase the efficiency of operations and reduce costs while also improving our effectiveness and our ability to monitor our messages and infrastructure. This software will be customized to allow clients to access their ads through our website and have advertising space via popular social media channels. All this is to facilitate our sales job and increase the efficiency and flexibility of our deployment channels. We have a demand that outstrips our ability to serve this demand, but we are pleased because we are growing and developing our capabilities. Our main suppliers are located in Kuwait, Dubai, and China; they have high quality services and technologies. Although I prefer local market suppliers, we invest more in quality hardware to ensure that we have durability and longevity.</p><h4>What have been the key factors in allowing you to develop exclusivity contracts with certain malls?</h4><p>In truth, it all started with a strong will and hard work. When I started with my partner, there were no other competitors in the market. We developed interactive ideas, and clients were immediately interested. Most of the companies in Kuwait are aggressively creative, especially telecoms, and this new offering really appealed to them. We worked with these companies to develop out-of-the-box ideas that could work really well with our media. Due to our hard work and consistency, we have become, by default, the only company in Kuwait that offers such a service. By the time, we took our position to be the main media service company in the market who provides high quality in mall service. </p><h4>What were the key steps in your expansion across the region?</h4><p>I was looking for Dubai Market, but we did not target it with the goal of operating, so we started activations in malls there just to have a presence there. Moreover, as long as 90% of the marketing budget decisions go through Dubai offices, our presence was a must to access big, important clients. We did the same in Qatar, entering the country through certain activations for telecoms companies then to a wider and bigger scope of clients. We planned to expand our presence there, but decided to focus more on the Kuwaiti market. We have an office in Lebanon as well, and we expect to add the same M2R products there in the near future. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been the evolution of printed newspaper consumption in Kuwait in the past five years and how are you adjusting to the new trends? </h4><p>Traditionally people would turn to newspapers to know what is happening in the world. Since the introduction of digital media, the biggest challenge printed media has faced is the fact that news spreads instantly online and is immediately updated and available to readers. So, by the time the newspaper had published the latest football scores, readers already knew who won the game. The challenge of immediacy presented by digital has led us to evolve in terms of depth and analysis. We may not break the news, but we understand more fully and with more depth what the news means and that's the added value we give to our readers.</p><h4>How is the Kuwait Times adapting to the increasing digitization? How can this create new opportunities for the Kuwait Times to attract a younger core of readers? <br></h4><p>We have added a slate of digital platforms including social media, website, YouTube, and WhatsApp to appeal to younger readers. In fact, we've gained readers across a range of interests thanks to our digital presence and growth. <br> </p><h4>Newspapers used to be the preferred platform for companies to advertise themselves; what noticeable changes have you observed in that regard in the past two years?</h4><p>Global ad spending for print has drastically dropped. We have suffered like all print media in Kuwait, the region, and the world, but we have also diversified our platforms to take advantage of digital advertising dollars. </p><h4>The Kuwait Times is the most widely read Kuwaiti newspaper in English; to what extent did that increase the country's exposure on the international stage and raised the interest about Kuwait?  <br></h4><p>Kuwait Times has been the voice of Kuwait internationally since its founding in 1961. Every foreign entity and person that has interest in Kuwait and the region refers to the Kuwait Times as a reliable paper of record for what is undergoing in Kuwait and the region.</p><h4>To what extent is the Kuwait Times trying to be more environmentally friendly in its printing activity?<br></h4><p>We recycle all returned papers and all our printing paper is recyclable. We also encourage our readers to use the PDF version of the newspaper online and via WhatsApp to reduce paper usage. <br></p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>Digitalizing the Kuwait Times has positioned us to compete in a wider field that includes regional and international digital media. Therefore, the competition is greater but so are the opportunities. I am positive on the outlook for Kuwait Times as a leading media outlet in Kuwait and the region. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How difficult was it for you to establish your business and obtain your general trading license? </h4><p>It was relatively easy. The new laws and partial digitization of government have helped streamline the process, cutting out much of the time and middlemen expenses. A significant reform that I found was extremely enabling is the elimination of the KWD50,000 (USD164,430) bank block prerequisite for issuing a license. Previously an SME would be required to deposit KWD50,000 to any bank and have the capital blocked before even starting with the legal process of establishing the company. This amount excludes the processing fees and the office rental requirement, and thus for a small business to start, entrepreneurs needed to start with a minimum of KWD55,000 (USD180,873). Even then, it would take from three to six months to set up. The previous policies have prevented many people from starting their own businesses; instead, we had to live in the shadows of our families or under the guardianship of the government. </p><h4>What potential challenges did you encounter when entering pharmaceutical products in Iraq?</h4><p>So far, I have not encountered any challenges. My partner in Iraq is connected to a vast network of physicians and pharmacists with which she has a good business relationship. Honesty and integrity facilitate these good relations, and with hard work we aim to expand the network of partnerships.</p><h4>What was your approach when looking for a partner in Iraq? </h4><p>I was fortunate in the sense that my partner in Iraq was actually the one who had approached me. My family owns one of the oldest pharmaceutical companies in Kuwait, and in 2005, I had attempted through my previously owned company to export specialized baby food to Iraq, including formula for premature babies, babies with lactose intolerance, and other formulas for babies with various deficiencies. I took several trips to Baghdad, assessing the need for such products and the market capacity. My attempts were unsuccessful despite the extremely high demand for such products and the low prices we provided. My Iraqi partner was aware of my attempts and core objectives before she had approached me. During the process though, the challenges I faced were mostly related to the limited information available by government institutions and the lack of clarity on policies and regulations. It is a mystery to uncover. Another challenge is the budgeting for government expenses. Between buying stamps, paying by KNet, and sometimes paying in cash, its difficult to estimate a budget for official processes; I often walk into the process like a blind person not knowing what everything costs or if I should carry cash.</p><h4>In light of the significant demand for pharmaceuticals in Iraq, how is Defiant International bridging the gap between GCC distributors and the Iraqi market? </h4><p>The shortage in pharmaceuticals in Iraq is a serious one. The Iraqi population has suffered tremendously under Saddam, and even worse after the 2003 war. Iraqis suffer from climate change-related diseases such as asthma and lung infections, diseases relating to poor nutrition such as diabetes, in addition to various cancers that are on the rise. Being under UNSC Chapter 7 sanction is exacerbating the critical situation. Due to these sanctions, the much-needed pharmaceutical products do not make it to the shelves in Iraq. These particular circumstances have presented an opportunity for my partner and I. </p><h4>What are your principal objectives for the year ahead? </h4><p>Aside from maintaining and expanding the relationships we have in Iraq, my principal objective this year is to find a bank willing to finance these operations. So far, purchases have been paid for 100% upfront, limiting the size and scope of our operations. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What makes project-based learning (PBL) such a unique methodology? What benefit can ACK graduates obtain from it?</h4><p>PBL is an experiential, hands-on approach to education, which not only ensures that students gain requisite knowledge but also applied skills and a workplace team focused attitude. Within increasingly competitive and globalised markets, employers now expect graduates to be productive from day one. Therefore, the traditional emphasis on academic knowledge is not sufficient to empower students. To bridge this gap, PBL is a learning methodology that involves the application of classroom theory to a workplace related scenario. Students, either individually or preferably in groups, are assigned an ill-defined project. They are then required to interpret theory and undertake further research as needed to fine-tune the task and then develop an industry standard solution. </p><h4>To what extent is ACK implementing the CDIO approach and what motivated the decision to apply it to ACK?</h4><p>CDIO is a holistic, experiential approach to learning that links the lifecycle phases of conceiving, designing, implementing, and operating a product, system, service, or process. CDIO may be regarded as an umbrella model that takes into account the wider formation of students so they are not just technically competent but also have the ability to sit back and consider, as a contributory team player, workplace situations from an evolving lifecycle perspective. This involves taking an embryonic idea through all the various steps associated with research, design, development and introduction, through to final ongoing operation. Beneath the umbrella approach of CDIO, various methodologies have been used to apply the model within particular learning contexts. At ACK, CDIO has been applied through PBL, internships, either locally or outside Kuwait, as a result of our membership of the International Association for the Exchange of Students for Technical Experience (IAESTE). </p><h4>How is ACK promoting diversity within its institution? What have been the benefits of it creating a global and international community within the institution?</h4><p>The name 'Australian College of Kuwait' confirms the link between our local infrastructure with the international community through the highly regarded Australian education system. Currently, the ACK family includes over 3000 students from 34 nationalities and over 400 staff from 47 nationalities. As a result, there is a rich diversity of cultures and backgrounds on campus. The Student Life team organizes a cultural celebration each year and invites all students and staff from any background to have an information booth and communal activities to raise awareness and understanding of their culture and traditions. Each semester, the Student Life staff arrange for participation of ACK student teams in international sporting competitions and other gatherings. Faculty are actively encouraged and supported to attend and present papers at international educational and professional conferences across the globe.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>Every student and every staff member at ACK is important. Accordingly, from an infrastructure perspective, we are doing our best to continuously improve the learning and living environment for all, recognizing that they spend more time at ACK than they do anywhere else during the semester. Later in 2019, ACK will co-host the third Symposia of Private Higher Education - Road to Excellence (SPHERE) event in association with the Kuwait Foundation for the Advancement of Sciences (KFAS). The central theme is e-learning, and this topic is of special interest to ACK as our programs across engineering, business, aviation, and maritime studies are all directly influenced by advancements in knowledge, technology, and electronic communications. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Vision 2035 focuses on increasing the education level within the Kuwaiti population. How is this reflected in AUK's initiatives?</h4><p>
	The American University of Kuwait has been visionary from the outset building upon intellectual traditions of the liberal arts that are by no means foreign to our culture, traditions, and region while continuously challenging the manner by which we pursue learning and deliver teaching and encouraging research that matters and that creates impact. In 2004, we understood the massive challenges that lay ahead of any educational enterprise in Kuwait, and we made the decision at that time to approach education in adhering to a three pronged approach: developing a university foundation and culture built upon transparency, equity, integrity, and governance while securing an unfettered approach to discussion and debate; creating an organizational infrastructure and environment that provides the optimal support for students through their educational endeavors here at AUK; and developing and implementing academic programs that respond to market needs while also identifying programs that drive and create markets, and that enable our institution to collaborate with external stakeholders and constituents in social, cultural, and technological development projects.
</p><h4>
	In light of the recent economic changes in the country, what sectors will need an increased number of qualified labor force?
</h4><p>
	Technology-related industries will continue to lead in the foreseeable future; however, that does not mean technological expertise operates in a vacuum. This growing sector, like all others, needs to be informed by other experts not necessarily in the field such as ethicists, economists, entrepreneurs, designers, anthropologists, sociologists and psychologists, and those who work in the medical fields, amongst many others. Regardless, therefore, of which sector requires the most or leads industry, Kuwait, like any other nation, requires a diverse workforce that is sufficiently flexible to adapt and adjust to seen as well as unforeseen change. We understand that no matter how extreme the labor needs shift, we will always be able to contribute to the workforce in ways that go beyond the specific skill sets required, but that is also inclusive of the specific skill sets.</p><h4>Where do you foresee AUK being in the next year?</h4><p>
	The more immediately visible developments is our campus expansion. In 2018, we fully completed the AUK Student Center which was carefully designed to enhance and support the student learning environment. We continue to do so this year with the construction of a multilevel academic building that will include a new auditorium, as well as music, drama, art and design areas; laboratories; as well as well as state-of-the-art classrooms and faculty offices. We have also created explorative areas to support research, learning, and teaching. In addition, we are in the process of rebuilding and expanding upon our administrative areas with a design focus on administrative efficiency and effectiveness. This year will, to a large extent, be no different than the years past and the years to come in that we have always and will continue to be self-reflective; experience has taught us the importance and the value of open and transparent conversations about what we do and moving forward on becoming better while always seeking the best in the services we provide to our students, our immediate constituents, and the broader Kuwaiti community in terms of educational delivery, the dissemination of knowledge, and providing opportunities for the creation of new knowledge. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>To what extent are the education reforms expected to raise the qualification level of professors and therefore improve the preparedness of Kuwaiti students?</h4><p>The government currently allocates 15-18% of its budget to the education sector that is being focused in the undergoing reform, which is aligned with Vision 2035. Our plan is to raise the level of education in Kuwait based on a revised curriculum. Since Kuwaiti students have not performed well in international exams over the past four to five years, we have been taking an in-depth look at the curriculum. Our main objective is to have a new philosophy of education where our primary schools have to follow international standards. At the same time, we will focus on the teacher training side, which is an important aspect of education reform, as well as the management in public schools. These are the three main aspects we will be focusing on over the next five years. It is also important to link primary education with higher education in one complete and integrated paradigm that will remain unaffected by other aspects of politics. We aim to have students able to compete under international standards coming on the back of this educational reform. Foreign languages will also remain a crucial pillar of our system; the English language has always been the main secondary language in Kuwait. In some high schools, students can also choose to learn French. We also try to promote certain sectors where we have a significant shortage, such as the technology sector and some highly technical vocations. We always study the market and we set our scholarship program and university admissions based on the requirements of the market. </p><h4>Around 23,000 Kuwaiti students are educated abroad at the expense of the ministry. To what extent is the country benefiting from this investment?</h4><p>Kuwait has always invested in its international scholarship program. By studying abroad, our students are exposed to different environments and education systems. They eventually bring back those contrastive perspectives that we can all learn from and potentially use. We currently send our students to 96 different countries including the US, the UK, France, New Zealand, and Australia. In addition, we have 13 satellite offices around the world for these students. We support this way of teaching, and the scholarship program will remain a cornerstone of our higher education system. On the other end, we have really attractive programs for Arabic, Islamic studies, and literature and art; many foreigners come here for those programs. </p><h4>To what extent are the education ministries and private companies collaborating to close any skill gaps between students' education and the requirements of the workforce?</h4><p>The private sector has always been close to both Kuwait University and private universities. Good graduates from private universities go to the private sector for employment. It is part of the whole paradigm of our education system to foment the relationship between the education system and the increasingly important private sector that offers exciting opportunities and professional growth. We also try to promote certain sectors where we have a significant shortage, such as the technology sector and some highly technical vocations. We always study the market, and we set our scholarship program and university admissions based on the requirements of the market. To do so, we have established a five-year plan that will now end in 2019. The program grants scholarships in medical fields, technology, and engineering and technical disciplines. We also give scholarships in other fields, such as accounting, finance, and foreign law. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How are you using new technologies to improve DHL's internal processes?</h4><p>New technologies are helping DHL improve the service it provides to its customers. For example, new technology is helping speed clearance of the shipment by integrating the systems of customs. There is visibility on all of the shipments before arrival, which allows us to get approval on the shipment and save time off clearance. We are also integrating technologies in our on-demand delivery (ODD) service. This is a way for our customers to arrange timing and location of the delivery. With an increase in B2C business, these shipments are going to home addresses where our customers are not available at all times. We, therefore, give our clients the option to arrange or give a time window to request the delivery of their shipments. In fact, Kuwait is the biggest and most advanced B2C market in the GCC. Hence, it is highly important for us to adapt our operation according to this new trend where people want to get regular updates on their shipments. We are using technology in every way we can to improve service. However, since DHL has such a global operation, we do not usually have that much flexibility when it comes to applying services and technologies adapted to the country we operate. All the processes and systems need to be aligned at an international scale. Not every country will be able to implement the system it wants—it has to be a part of a global solution. Nonetheless, it is not stopping us from implementing new technologies as long as we can sustain the level of service we are applying.</p><h4>What changes have you made to accommodate more B2C business and lower its cost?</h4><p>In order to cater this increasing B2C demand, we have decided to allocate half of our workforce to B2B orders in the morning and the remaining half of our fleet is working at a later point of the day, until 10pm in order to respond to our B2C business, which is expected to grow by 18% in 2019. We also deliver on Fridays, allowing us to reach a significant number of B2C clients since they tend to be more available as compared to regular weekdays. </p><h4>What is DHL's input regarding environmentally friendly delivery processes?</h4><p>DHL is actively looking at ways to reduce its carbon footprint. For this reason, in the Middle East, the company has a target of reaching a certain number of environmental standards and gas free vehicles. We eventually want our fleet to be 100% electric. We have started in the UAE, but it might take longer to get started in Kuwait. The use of green packaging is being driven globally and is being cascaded down to all the countries. Environmental considerations are something DHL is constantly thinking about, but the process of implementing everything to each country will take time.</p><h4>What will be key for the sector to raise in value in the upcoming years?</h4><p>Part of the government's plan is to have a new cargo village, representing a significant part of the undergoing innovation of the airport. The government is planning to have an area where all the cargo companies will be located. Something DHL is working on is to have its own facility and inner-site facility, making operations smoother for us and speeding up delivery for our customers. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What key factors ensured Incheon won the tender for the T4 terminal, and what challenges have you encountered thus far?</h4><p>This tender was composed of performance and price. Incheon already has a great deal of knowledge in terms of airport performance and experience for airport operations. Our airport in Korea is already the number-one graded airport in the world. Currently, 70 million passengers use our airport without accident per year, and we maintain an extremely high service level. Therefore, we are already approved in many countries, and that is one factor. In addition, we were able to quote an extremely competitive price for this project. Our experience allowed us to narrow the focus points of the airport's operation. We simultaneously reduced costs and invested in improving our processes. In some respects, we were able to find ways to use the airport efficiently. This project will be a critical point for us. The T4 terminal operation can act as a base for us in this area, and it will be a great opportunity to prove that we can run an airport in this region. Even though it is a small terminal, we will do our best to operate it in a fast and convenient way. We already have experience in airports in the Philippines and Indonesia, and we are familiar with that area. For Kuwait, we will use our learnings from our operations in Erbil where we got to understand more about the culture in the Gulf. Kuwait is the next step on our journey in the region. </p><h4>What practices are you using in the Incheon International airport that can be transferred to Kuwait's T4?</h4><p>Operations are the same regardless of the size of the airport. In order to better understand the culture in the GCC, we have observed the Middle Eastern airports that are well performing, such as Dubai and Doha. However, we have noticed that in general, there are margins for improvement when it comes to the service quality within airport facilities in the region. That is why we draw special attention to the quality we can offer, as we are proud of our services. We want to transfer our service quality to the Middle East. We are confident that we can do that extremely well. We therefore want to channel our efforts on two important factors: convenience and safety. In the service area, we want to use our knowledge and share it with young Kuwaiti graduates. We want to offer a comprehensive training by sending our people to Korea in order for them to learn the different aspects of airport operations processes at our academy. They will also be provided with training oriented toward passenger services and operational safety. They will eventually complete a one to two months practice at Incheon Airport and learn many things from our experience and working environment. After three to five years, they will be experts in airport operations. We seek to train them to increase their service quality overall. </p><h4>What are Incheon's key objectives for 2019?</h4><p>Until the end of 2018, we were focused on expanding our operations to get all Kuwait Airways flights operating from T4. This means there will be more than 10,000 passengers departing and arriving from this terminal. Before, only about 60% of them operated there. We are also focused on solidifying the stable operations of all Kuwait Airways flights by establishing direct flights from Kuwait to the US by 2019. In addition, we want to change the aesthetic of the terminal in order for passengers to feel at home in the terminal. As mentioned, we also aim to improve the logistic of the facility by finding a way to process people faster. </p>]]></richbody0content>
