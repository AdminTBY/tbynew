		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As the commercial arm of the Abu Dhabi Media Zone Authority, twofour54 was set up to nurture the development of the thriving entrepreneurship ecosystem in the field of media and entertainment. How would you describe the creative environment and the work culture at twofour54?</h4><p>A group of 30 people started up this company in 2008. From day one we wanted to reflect creativity, teamwork, and a unique sense of environment, differentiating ourselves from the usual companies that fall under the government and follow a specific structure, for example, in the way that their offices look. This does not mean that our processes are not fully compliant with the government, but that there is a difference in the feel and look of twofour54 and in how people operate here. This is a loose environment where we allow for creativity, and it is an environment where we allow people to express themselves. At the end of the day, they are part of a creative sector or cluster that is commercially based. In our creative lab, people have a space to feel part of a creative community where they can share their ideas. We have a video editing room, an audio editing room,  and tablets for creatives to work on their films, animations, or games, and also a game area to help generate ideas and encourage the flow of creativity, all for free. Individuals can come here during the weekends too. This is where we harness their creative energy.</p><h4>What encourages companies to set up in Abu Dhabi at twofour54?</h4><p>twofour54 operates the media zone in Abu Dhabi, which allows media companies setting up at twofour54 to enjoy 100% ownership without the need of a local sponsor, repatriate 100% of their profits, and pay 0% corporate taxation. In addition, twofour54's business and content regulations are best-in-class and provide the much desired regulatory clarity to media companies. tawasol—the one-stop-shop of twofour54—takes care of the visas, driving licenses, travel arrangements, and even employee medical checkups for companies that set up here at twofour54. twofour54 actively engages with the companies in the media zone to support their local, regional, and international business development needs. We encourage films to be shot in Abu Dhabi by providing a 30% rebate offered by the Abu Dhabi Film Commission that also comes with support facilities, such as production services by intaj, freelancers, and other talent. twofour54's support services on the production projects ensure that Emirati talent receives training that supports our industry development efforts. When we work with Bollywood, Hollywood, or even regional operators, each one of them operates differently, so our standards are designed in a way that allows for an efficient work process while allowing for local talent participation, and still reach the standards and expectations the companies have. Producers do not have that much time, so we need to manage their demands and make sure we achieve them as quickly as possible. We try to provide services that are not provided anywhere else. If you come at it from the perspective that all you need to do is make it a free zone and people will come, you will not get far. It is more than that—it is a specialized zone. Getting people from all over the world to set up here encourages a marriage of expertise and culture and helps considerably in driving more innovation.</p><div class="quote">“We want to talk about how to build a sustainable media ecosystem in the Middle East."</div><h4>In terms of content and new developments, what are some current projects taking place at twofour54?</h4><p>We have partners like CNN, Sky News Arabia, and Cartoon Network set up here, and each one of them is responsible for its own target when it comes to its content or news segments. The Ubisoft studio developed a full iOS (iPad compatible) game called CSI: Hidden Crimes in Abu Dhabi with some graduates of Ubisoft Abu Dhabi, and it currently has over 13 million downloads. Furthermore, season two of an Emirati animation called Mansour supported by Mubadala, which used to be done outside the UAE, will be fully developed here in the Cartoon Network studios. We will also start filming the GCC version of Sesame Street, Iftah Ya Simsim, by the end of 2014, and it will show in 2015 on all GCC channels. We plan to have a channel on YouTube that will show the short films that are being made at twofour54; more than 400 members from our creative lab are volunteering on those short films. We have received a request from Etihad Airways to work on a documentary that shows the stories of Emirati pilots and cadets. These projects are helping our ecosystem by bringing more professionals, young creatives, and enthusiasts to twofour54; our creative lab now has more than 10,000 registered members. Our production services arm, intaj, has supported the production of more than 18,000 hours of content from its Abu Dhabi studios. intaj works closely with the Abu Dhabi Film Commission to encourage international films to be filmed here, such as Fast and Furious 7, Star Wars 7, together with Bollywood films. We have also arranged for two episodes of the BBC's Top Gear to be filmed here.</p><h4>To what extent has the filming of Star Wars in Abu Dhabi attracted more bids from other big names like Sony, Hollywood, and Universal?</h4><p>After we finished with the Star Wars filming in Abu Dhabi, we went to Los Angeles to visit some studios. They already knew who we are, what we are doing, and what we are offering. We do get requests and we have a list of projects in consideration, so the filming of Star Wars here in Abu Dhabi has played a huge part in gaining international recognition for the Emirate. When you look at the regulations and the policies in Los Angeles, Hollywood is not encouraging films to be shot there. So people are looking outside of Los Angeles to Canada, the UK, and New Zealand. Producers look at which countries in the world offer the best rebates and incentives. In addition to finding the right location, they are keen to find the most efficient way to spend their money. Luckily, we are getting a lot of regional requests and many TV-series-based offers because of what we have to offer. Bollywood is acting faster than the rest of the region, Hollywood included. India is just three hours away by plane, so the close country proximity also adds to the list of benefits of filming here.</p><h4>What kind of filming and production environment is Bollywood looking for here?</h4><p>They look at highways, buildings, and beaches. Mostly, it is about the locations for Bollywood. Although I would emphasize that our location in Abu Dhabi can be found elsewhere. It is what comes with it, the services and the team, that makes the difference. It is not easy to make sure that everything is ready for a shoot. With Star Wars, for example, we had to build a road in the desert in 10 days. You also need to make sure you have all your permits from the municipality, the Department of Transport, and the federal entities, and when it comes to security, from the Police and the Army as well. So the whole package is what truly makes the place an attraction</p><h4>What effect is the growing media industry having on Abu Dhabi's economy?</h4><p>As well as accounting for an increasing share of GDP and helping economic diversification, the media sector also supports other sectors such as tourism. For example, several scenes from Fast and Furious 7 were shot in Abu Dhabi, including a scene that includes Etihad Towers. People will want to come and see those buildings in real life as a result. When that film is premiered, there will be a huge buzz in the city that will end up trickling down and affecting the economy. This is evident from films in other countries such as the impact Lord of the Rings had in New Zealand.</p><h4>With the Abu Dhabi Media Summit in November 2014, the three themes are distribution, content, and finance. What are some of the main topics for discussion on the agenda?</h4><p>At the Summit we want to talk about how to build a sustainable media ecosystem in the Middle East. From a financing perspective, we want to talk about how start-ups can be taken to the next level. From a distribution and content perspective, there is a lot of piracy taking place and that will be a major topic of discussion. People will also be talking about the mobilization of content. We will be hosting people from Europe, the US, the region, and the Far East to talk about their models. For instance, the Hulu and Netflix models do not exist here yet. We will also be discussing developments in the industry, such as new gadgets and technology.</p><h4>How do you see the media industry in Abu Dhabi and in the region in comparison to others in the world?</h4><p>Our aim here is to have an ecosystem and a creative environment for Emiratis, Arabs, and also for our international partners who are changing the standards of the media industry in the region. Unfortunately, the industry in the region is not up to date in terms of technology and variety of content, as well as audience measurement data and techniques. If you compare the European or American industry, we are lagging behind. An important angle that we are looking into is what are the best ways to measure our content. We do have a people meter in the UAE, which is called tview, but it does not cover all broadcasters as yet. The idea is that content should be driven by creators and then judged by audiences and networks. Currently in the region, advertisers dictate the continuity of a show, which is a barrier to the industry flourishing. We want the media sector to be a viable sector and one with standards.</p><h4>How do you view twofour54's role in the region?</h4><p>We always look at where we are in Abu Dhabi, in the UAE, and in the region, and start from there. This is where we are operating and why we are focusing on the Arab language; it affects the kinds of content we can create, whether it is books, eBooks, games, applications, short films, or whatever. We are developing an industry, not building one. We have a media industry here; however, in the past it was very closed-off. Looking at the future of twofour54, it is about how we can be a game changer. It is having the ability to go out there and say, “This measurement is not right. We need to fix it." We are trying to build a model that is different from anywhere else in the region. We have more than 26% local Emiratis operating their media companies here in twofour54 and I feel upset when I see content that does not reflect us as we really are. I believe we need to make sure that we continue to provide a stable environment for creativity whilst demonstrating that there is a moderate way to operate. We understand that if you want to have a full-fledged industry, you should allow for many things to take place.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the competitive landscape like for the auditing firms here in Zambia? Where does ZPMG fit into it?</h4><p>In Zambia, we have all of the big four firms operating—KPMG, Deloitte, PWC, and Ernst &amp; Young (EY). We also have a fifth one, Grant Thornton. Then we have a number of other mid-sized firms and a host of smaller, local ones with no international connections, and a few self proprietors. It is quite competitive at the moment. If I look at what has happened over the last two or three years, virtually all of the big four firms have rebranded, recapitalized, or restructured their operations. A visible sign of this is that virtually all of them have moved out of the central business district (CBD), as we did in 2011, when the firm was reconstituted. When you look at the movements amongst the firms, there has been a lot of inward investment from the international networks. Some of the other firms have brought in specialist partners to develop certain service lines, and we have done the same, for example, to grow our advisory business. We brought in an infrastructure specialist from the UK at the senior management level. We have added some forensic specialists and have built up our IT advisory unit. We are doing quite a bit to make sure that we get a good share of the cake that is here. In fact, I would like to get an unfair share of the market! The competition is vibrant and it is a positive climate with healthy competition.</p><h4>What was the impetus for all of the big four to rebrand at about the same time?</h4><p>I would say it dovetailed with the growth in Zambia's economy. Zambia has been recognized as one of the fastest growing economies in the world, and it is definitely amongst the top five in Africa. There has been a lot of FDI coming in, and even up to now we get inquiries all the time about people wanting to come to Africa. There must be something here. That really has been the impetus. The growth in Zambia's economy has made the rest of the world wake up. These four firms have realized that Zambia is the place to be, and if they do not develop their practice now and make the investment, it may be too late in five years time.</p><div class="quote">“The competition is vibrant and it is a positive climate with healthy competition."</div><h4>With so much inward investment, what differentiates KPMG?</h4><p>In past years, we were known mostly as an audit and tax compliance firm; however, we are building up our resources in the advising space, the management consulting space, transactions restructuring, and we have a fully-fledged forensic unit, because there is a great deal of opportunity here for that kind of specialization. We place a lot of emphasis on the quality of our work. When I look at our strategic objectives, it is people first, then quality, profitability, and growth. As a result, the market perspective changes and you get awards such as Auditor of the Year or Consultant of the Year. It is all about market perception, and that perception has changed for the better. Furthermore, we are a young, vibrant firm. Even our recruitment policies are not necessarily recruiting based on qualifications—we want to see drive, passion, and zeal. When I am evaluating a candidate for recruitment, I want to know if this person is going to be better than me. If not, I will not even bother. I want to bring in someone who is sharper than me, who is going to do better than me. That is how to increase the quality of our existing talent.</p><h4>Can you tell us about your client base?</h4><p>Our existing client base is across all sectors. For example, in financial services there are a number of banks. We service the likes of Standard Bank, which is a subsidiary of Standard Bank of South Africa, Bank ABC, a regional bank in southern Africa, Citibank, which is worldwide, Access Bank, which came out of Nigeria, and Indo-Zambia Bank. Locally, there is the Madison Group of companies that has Madison General Insurance, Madison Life, Madison Asset Management, and Madison Financial Services, which has just listed on the Lusaka Stock Exchange. In retail, there is Pick n Pay, a major South African chain, and fashion company Foschini. In oil there is Total, in manufacturing, Ndola Lime, in agriculture, Cargill Cotton, and quite a number of others. It is quite a broad range. In real estate, Real Estate Investment Zambia PLC, which owns a number of prime properties, is a client, as is Knight Frank in the real estate business. It is quite a varied client base. When I look at the proportion of international versus local clients, it is probably about 50-50. About 50% is work referred from other KPMG offices, and then 50% is probably local. When I look at the revenues, about 60% of revenues are from local clients and 40% from referred work.</p><h4>Where do you see the most opportunities in the economy?</h4><p>First of all, mining. Whether I like it or not, mining looks to be our main foreign exchange earner for years to come. It might not be the highest contributor to GDP, because agriculture is actually the largest contributor to GDP, but mining is what brings in export earnings and what has more of a ripple effect in terms of the entire economy. The price of copper will affect the exchange rate. Mining will always be up there. There are other areas, like tourism. That really has a great deal of untapped potential because much of Zambia is still virgin bush. A number of tourist spots have not been exploited yet. People know Victoria Falls, but no one knows that we have white sand beaches around the lakes near Samfya, for example. There are many other natural sights in other parts of the country, way off the beaten track. Tourism would be a good investment destination for FDI. Another one would be water. Hydroelectricity generation is just waiting to be tapped. Zambia has something like 40% of the water in southern Africa. We have a lot of rivers, waterfalls, and a number of our rivers run at a gradient. There are a number of power projects underway right now. Provided all these power stations come onboard between now and 2018, the power deficit should be wiped out and Zambia should become a net exporter of power. Also, there is an opportunity for a number of independent power plants. Infrastructure and power represents a major opportunity for businesspeople, but it is obviously long term in nature. Another is road and rail infrastructure. In railways, we recently helped Northwest Rail organize financing to build a railway from Solwezi all the way through to Angola. The agreement has been signed and financial closure is expected sometime soon. All these are great opportunities, and it goes back to helping Zambia become a land-linked country. We have also had a query from someone who wants to build a railway from the Northwest province right down through Namibia to the coast. Infrastructure is a great opportunity. Then again, agriculture will always be there. Over 50% of Zambia's land is arable, but only about 14% is actually under cultivation. So much of Zambia is green, but untilled. Agriculture is a major opportunity. If you look at when Zimbabwe had its problems and a number of its farmers crossed the river from Zimbabwe to Zambia, the tobacco production went up well over 50% over a period of two or three years. That shows there is a tremendous amount of untapped potential in agriculture.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>We begin a new era of our Republic and our democracy. An era of peace, tolerance, consensus, unity, and social justice with a government that will put people first in all of its decisions. I accept the historic responsibility of leading this country, aware of the great challenges that lie ahead: maintaining economic growth with equity, dealing with debt, increasing investment, and fighting for transparency and the implementation of a process of justice and equity recovery, with respect for the rule of law. I pledge in my management to set up an honest, transparent, and efficient government, whose only objective will be to serve society, improve public services, and equitably distribute the wealth and heritage that God has bequeathed to this beautiful country. I wish to make clear that the foreign policy of our government will be based on dialogue, convergence, tolerance, and mediation, in search of the well being of all peoples. As President, I will work tirelessly to ensure that all Panamanians are responsible world citizens and our isthmus is a point of convergence and unity, serving our people and the international community with our extensive transport and logistics infrastructure and Canal, port, airport, and the Colón Free Trade Zone. I seal my commitment to delivering and to assuming this position for the sole purpose of serving our people, the region, and the world. Over the coming years, we will undertake major works, but the greatest legacy to future generations will be a functional democracy where state resources are used only to serve the people. Corruption will not be tolerated in our government.</p><p>Based on this commitment, from this moment we start the most important aspect: the transformation from politics based on business and patronage to politics based on service and a clear vision for the state. We will encourage foreign investment and tourism development, in search of creating more jobs with higher wages. We will strengthen legal security and respect the commercial diplomacy of countries that promote their businesses, all this based on the highest possible standards of transparency and honesty, in defense of the interests of our country. I will sign a historic decree that will establish the return of price controls to the basic food basket in order to avoid speculation. I am respectful of the free market, but I am opposed to speculation when this affects the food of the people.</p><div class="quote">“With great humility, I take the responsibility and commitment to set up an honest and transparent government."</div><p>In Colón, we will start a restoration project for this beautiful city so it can again become the jewel of the Caribbean, as it was in the past. In San Miguelito, we will implement a joint task force that will impact more than 300,000 households, giving them basic healthcare and a roof of hope to all those families. Focusing on improving the quality of life, we will give our city an accessible and efficient metropolitan public transport system, building lines two and three of the subway and incorporating the Metro Bus. Hope will return to the neighborhoods. With our “Safe Neighborhoods" Plan, we will transform the city of Colón and begin the transformation of other forgotten neighborhoods with “More Opportunities and Firm Hand." We will build new centers and community facilities to make sport and culture available to our young people, so they can grow healthy and coexist healthily. We will invite the over 200 operating gangs in the country to take advantage of an amnesty to surrender their weapons, cut their ties with organized crime, and enter formal life. Over the coming months, more than a thousand Panamanian teachers will depart for training in the English language, so we can commence our bilingual education project. At the same time, we will undertake the nationwide construction of vocational colleges. The Universal Fellowship will be strengthened and the benefits for people over 65 will be increased from 70 to 120, and we will promote an agreement with the Social Security Fund to provide health coverage to these senior citizens. We have been blessed by the Panama Canal, a work in the service of our country and global trade. As President, I will ensure that the expansion of the Canal is culminated successfully, protecting the interests of the Panamanian State. I wish to send a message to all producers in Chiriqui and to our farmers: Farm your land and resume production. As President of the country, there is a man in whose veins runs peasant blood who will give them all the support they require, and price and market stability to increase our food production and ensure food security.</p><p>I invite the health and education sectors for immediate dialogue. The unification of medical services can wait no longer. The savings will be split into two, with one half to improve services and the other to increase the salaries of our health workers. With regard to the education sector, dialogue in search of improving education and working conditions is a permanent process. The doors of the presidency will be open to all Panamanians who struggle and work daily for our country. Respect and tolerance will be the basis of our ties with all trade unions and associations in the country.</p><p>Today, a new stage of maturity, respect, and institutional strengthening starts for our country. We aim to protect the lives of all citizens. This is our only mission and from this moment, partisan politics will be once and for all removed from our security agencies. I have appointed qualified officers to direct all our security sectors. With them, and the 15,000 men and women who are part of the public security force, we will work to remove organized crime, drug traffickers, and money launderers from our neighborhoods, our country, and our region in order to protect our citizens and the integrity of our financial and logistic system. I make a call to lay aside any differences and to seek the progress and welfare of our people, the social peace necessary to move forward together as a nation and make way for a new era of peace, and prosperity and equity for all Panamanians and for those who have made this land their new home.</p><p>With great humility, I take the responsibility and commitment to set up an honest and transparent government that will respect the balance by which the Panamanian people voted in the elections, and that will invest the wealth of our country so as to positively impact the quality of life of all Panamanians, without distinction of any kind. For Panama to be a role model of democracy we will always seek the unity of our people and our region, supporting a non-confrontational world where our enemies will be hunger, inequality, and the other problems that affect us.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does the rebranding of Alwaseeta represent a reinvigoration strategy for the company?</h4><p>The rebranding was a strategic decision that we adopted to give further momentum to the company in order to establish ourselves more prominently, and reinforce our objectives and strategy. Qatar Holding was too generic a name, and we felt it did not reflect our business or the company vision. Alwaseeta is an Arabic name meaning “intermediate," which is relevant given that our business is with intermediate industries. We want to recreate the company's vision at a higher level, fully in step with the National Vision, and our new strategy received the approval of the Supreme Council for Economics and Investment.</p><h4>In which sectors do you see the greatest potential for growth?</h4><p>Hydrocarbons are experiencing huge growth, especially in the downstream segment. Petrochemical derivatives are also a major business line, though everything depends on the economic viability of a project. In moving from primary to secondary industry, we have two or three sectors, such as the chemical clusters, and from those chemical clusters we develop other projects, and we can build on them further downstream meaning that the opportunities are unlimited in terms of moving even further downstream. We are working on expanding these operations, and are striving to fulfill our duties for the Qatar National Vision 2030. Qatar is also producing aluminum with Qatalum, and we plan to develop downstream opportunities in this industry through enhanced technological processes, such as rolling mills and extrusion.</p><div class="quote">“In our business plan, we have over 10 projects in the five-year cycle plan at different stages of development."</div><h4>What role will investment opportunities abroad play in Alwaseeta's growing profile?</h4><p>One of our mandates as a company is to seek investment through mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As). We are interested in companies that can bring technology that serves our vision, strategies, or projects. Additionally, we are exploring M&amp;A opportunities with companies that can bring added value to us overseas and also enhance and consolidate our business in the domestic market. For example, if we develop a joint venture here in Qatar with a foreign partner, we will try to align with that company's other businesses. By acquiring shares and investing in their ventures abroad, we can consolidate and develop synergies in both marketing and product development.</p><h4>Does diversification figure in your strategies for the future?</h4><p>In our business plan, we have over 10 projects in the five-year cycle plan at different stages of development. Beyond our five-year cycle, we have over 30 diversified hydrocarbon and non-hydrocarbon projects. We assess the market and consider the value of a project, but have no preference for either hydrocarbon or non-hydrocarbon based projects, as each serves its own purpose. We wish to become a leading manufacturer and distributor of intermediate petrochemical and non-hydrocarbon products in the region.</p><h4>How does Alwaseeta contribute to the Qatar National Vision 2030?</h4><p>We have been part of that vision from the outset. QP was already present, and so we built a platform on it. We contribute by boosting the economy and supporting the development of Qatar's human resources—all of this is part of the National Vision 2030. We are dedicated to developing Qatar's human resources by refining their skills and education and empowering individuals to reach their full potential. Regarding sustainability, we aim to create products that are environmentally friendly. We will be looking into the country's waste management strategy as part of this in full cooperation with the Ministry of Environment. We are also bringing energy conservation technology to Qatar. We work in very close cooperation with Kahramaa in its program of conserving energy consumption within the country.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate the performance of Holcim's Azerbaijani operations in 2013?</h4><p>We achieved our production, sales, customer satisfaction, and employee development targets. Moreover, this success was not only registered within Azerbaijan itself, but throughout the global Holcim Group. We have ensured our leading position through the development and growth of the Azerbaijani economy and its attractive business climate. In addition, we are strong partners for the various international projects of Holcim. Currently, we coordinate the Holcim Awards competition, which is open for projects that champion sustainable construction. Many people from Azerbaijan will be interested and keen to participate. Meanwhile, we have invested much time and energy into the training of our employees in occupational health and safety, aiming at a zero-accident level at our plant. All of our activities enable us to be a customer-focused and cost-efficient company with the highest standards of safety, personal development, and social dialogue.</p><h4>Holcim's dedication to environmental protection is recognized worldwide. How has the company brought its expertise in this field to Azerbaijan?</h4><p>As a member of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), we are united in our commitment to sustainable development via the three pillars of economic growth, ecological balance, and social progress. In 2000, Holcim was a co-founder of the Cement Sustainability Initiative (CSI) helping the cement industry to address the challenges of sustainable development, and has been listed in the FTSE4Good Sustainability Index and confirmed as a member of the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for a decade. Holcim is dedicated to the continual improvement of environmental performance. Cement production is a resource- and energy-intensive process that requires sustainable solutions. Eco-efficiency is therefore at the heart of our business. By reducing the resources used in production and minimizing waste, we aim to be at the forefront of the drive toward to a more sustainable construction industry. In general, 2013 was a turning point in the history of construction in Azerbaijan. Construction of the modern state-of-the-art plant was finalized, and this production facility has been completely modernized, having replaced the existing four old wet kiln lines with a single new dry kiln line. The new dry kiln consumes 50% less energy than its predecessors, emits 50 times less dust, and decreases water consumption by 500,000 cubic meters annually.</p><div class="quote">“Holcim Azerbaijan is one of the pioneers of corporate social responsibility."</div><h4>In addition to its environmental activities, community development is part and parcel of your operations in Azerbaijan, particularly as it pertains to educating its youth. What were your main initiatives in this area in 2013, and what are you looking to achieve in this regard in 2014?</h4><p>Holcim Azerbaijan is one of the pioneers of corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities in the Azerbaijani business environment. The CSR program is aimed at bringing benefits for the sustainable development of the country and cementing the foundations for the future development of its people. We have established a Community Advisory Panel in the Garadagh region. Through formal dialogue sessions, open days, and local partnerships we participate in building prosperity for communities. Our company established various centers: the Youth Development Center, the Employment Center, and the Center for Rehabilitation of Children with Special Needs are all the success stories of Holcim Group Companies. The Employment Center provides various services, including career planning, access to the labor market, and workshops on access to targeted social aid programs. In operation since August 2011, more than 1,200 people have applied to the organization, 193 people have found full-time employment, 950 people have taken part in seminars, and 60 people have received targeted social aid.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the Ministry of Electricity and Renewable Energy contributed to the transformation of Ecuador's energy matrix since its founding in 2007?</h4><p>Before 2007, there wasn't a Ministry of Electricity and Renewable Energy in Ecuador to regulate this strategic sector of the economy. As a result, prior to 2007, the energy sector had experienced a number of complications, and in fact, was on the verge of collapse as a result of inadequate investment. This was exacerbated by the fact that a move toward privatizing the sector was hamstringed by legal uncertainties and internal complications. Therefore, in 2007, the Ministry was created to spearhead sector recovery and growth, which since then has been pronounced. In 2009, we saw a few problems in terms of poor supply, but those were basically related to the prior lack of investment. Starting in 2007, we set out a plan to swiftly reinvigorate the sector. The first idea was to take advantage of the country's huge water potential, which is why we conducted studies to build hydroelectric projects. Currently, Ecuador has eight large hydroelectric projects under development. At the same time as we developed these projects, it was necessary to invest in conventional thermal power generation using national fossil fuel reserves. Previously, thermal power generation had used imported fuels. We have developed nine thermal plants, with around 600 MW of capacity, as well as four hydroelectric plants of around 460 MW of capacity, in addition to the eight under construction. Finally, we have taken the important, symbolic step of developing a wind farm with a 16.5-MW capacity. Overall, we have achieved an increase of almost 1,100 MW in capacity over a very short period of time.</p><h4>What is the status of power consumption in the country's energy strategy?</h4><p>We have also been focused on improving efficiency in power consumption since 2007. The main segment of energy consumption in Ecuador is domestic; 35% of electricity consumed is residential, and this is where we have focused our attention. The first program involved the replacement of incandescent bulbs with compact florescent lamps and energy saving light bulbs. Today, incandescent light bulbs are no longer available in Ecuador as all bulbs are fluorescent. This is a high-impact project that involves a ban on the importation of incandescent lamps, which is key to managing energy consumption. We have another ambitious project geared at getting people to use electricity for cooking instead of LPG, whereby the public would be both washing and cooking using renewable, domestically generated electricity. We are also working to replace inefficient refrigerators; we plan to replace 330,000 refrigerators in Ecuador. Finally, the other major axis has been to restore and strengthen the management of electricity companies' distribution and transmission systems. We have had problems in this area, especially relating to network losses and low revenue collection, and we've work hard and we can now safely say that one of the great achievements of the national government has been the reduction of loss. When the government took office, the loss of electric power was above 22%, but with the efforts we have made the loss rate is now at 12.6%, and many international eyes are looking at what we have achieved in just a short period of time. Ecuador saves $20 million per year for each percentage point of reduction, which means that the country has saved hundreds of millions of dollars in lost electricity. We have substantially improved the issue of collection as well; we formerly had a recovery rate of 93% and now are at 98% or 99%. That's a more complex issue because the electrical distribution networks are very large and we have improved the quality of service. That is why we have worked throughout the electrical industry chain, meaning generation, distribution, and transmission, but also in energy efficiency.</p><div class="quote">“We have achieved an increase of almost 1,100 MW in capacity over a very short period of time."</div><p>© The Business Year - September 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The banking sector in Qatar is developing into a competitive market. How does Ahli Bank try to distinguish itself from the competitors?</h4><p>We are a medium-sized bank. It may seem that our capital is a disadvantage, but we actually tend to think the opposite because we are able to be close to our customers. However, that is not our only distinguishing feature. When a customer comes to one of the branches or corporate offices of Ahli Bank, we promise to deliver a superior customer experience. Our team is extremely skilled, and we are proud of the people that represent Ahli Bank.</p><h4>What are the recent initiatives that the bank has taken to improve its services?</h4><p>In fact, when the ownership of the bank changed in 2013, we took the strategic decision to change our decision-making process within the bank and flatten the hierarchy. This should ultimately be reflected in meeting the demands and expectations of our clients. We also decided that we are not going to be a bank for everybody, but we will target specific segments. When this was decided, we also reset the delivery process. We are investing heavily in technology, such as mobile banking, in order to cater for the segment of the market in which we are present.</p><div class="quote">“My ultimate goal is to see the bank consistently among the top three in terms of returns to shareholders."</div><h4>What are the segments of the market that you are targeting?</h4><p>One of our priorities is to increase our market share in retail banking. The investment plan for 2014 foresees reinforcing our brand identity and advancing our human capital and management skills. We work on a wider basis in retail than some other banks, and we have set an objective to increase that.</p><h4>In 2013, the Qatar Foundation got involved in Ahli Bank by buying a 29% stake. Does that have any impact on the company?</h4><p>Definitely. The Qatar Foundation has certainly raised the profile of the bank in the local market. It has opened up some interesting opportunities that we could seize. Currently, we are working with the Qatar Foundation on certain projects, which will eventually increase our revenues. The Qatar Foundation is always seeking safe and profitable investments. I am sure it has chosen Ahli Bank to support it investment objectives; therefore, it gives us comfort to know that we are considered a solid business partner.</p><h4>How does the bank stand in view of the coming Basel III requirements?</h4><p>The Qatar Central Bank (QCB) enforces the implementation of the Basel III rules. Most, if not all, Qatari banks comply with those rules. Ahli Bank complies with the requirements of the QCB up to 90% in terms of capital and liquidity. We are addressing the remaining 10%, too. One of the liquidity ratios to comply with has to do with liability mismatches, and we are working on that issue. I support the regulations of the QCB in terms of Basel III requirements, and they do not hinder us from growing our business. We have ample capital, so the Basel III requirements will not obstruct us from expanding.</p><h4>In 2013, the bank underwent a restructuring of its operations. Could you inform us about the changes that have taken place?</h4><p>Actually, there are three important aspects that we have worked on. The first was business banking. We have made the structure more intense. Secondly, we addressed the control issues, and started carrying out gap analysis procedures to understand where the risks are, allowing us to address them directly. And, thirdly, we examined our human capital. There are still some gaps left to fill, but we have already achieved a lot.</p><h4>Qatar is developing rapidly, and infrastructure projects have taken center stage in that regard. How does Ahli Bank aim to contribute to the development of the country?</h4><p>Geographically, our focus is Qatar. We are a 90%-95% Qatar-exposed company in terms of the balance sheet, so we have to demonstrate that commitment to the country as well. Ahli Bank, as well as other Qatari banks, have invested their capital in funding many infrastructure projects. The country is growing, and its population is swelling. The current infrastructure network cannot cope with the pace of growth and cannot effectively address some of the arising issues. It is only natural that we feel obliged to support this move forward.</p><h4>What are the main challenges for the financial sector in the coming years?</h4><p>I can foresee several major challenges. The one that I would like to point out is corporate governance. There will be changes to it in the future, with new regulations coming up. Banks are now limited in terms of product range. It is now shrinking to loans. The loans, however, require capital. Therefore, banks need to consider ways to supplement their fee income in order to keep up with the profit growth trend, yet minimize risk.</p><h4>Where would you like to see Ahli Bank stand a decade from now?</h4><p>My ultimate goal is to see the bank consistently among the top three in terms of returns to shareholders. Increasing our size, be it locally or internationally, is not our core strategy.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the importance of your statistics overall?</h4><p>Trusted statistics provide a sound basis for decision-making and policy development. SCAD is the key producer of statistics for the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. We collect, compile, and analyze data from primary and secondary sources, and using modern technology we disseminate statistics on a wide range of subjects including businesses, economic indicators, prices and foreign trade, demographics, agriculture, and the environment. For example, the recently completed Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) is an important survey that looks at individual and household spending and income patterns. The results will throw light on the living standards of households, which in turn can provide a way to measure the well-being of society. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is constructed from the results of the HIES. This measure provides information about price changes in the Emirate's economy, which is used by government and industry sectors, as well as the research community. Furthermore, SCAD is the only source of time series data that tracks the social and economic development of the Emirate. This is a key resource for correlation, trend analysis, and forecasting studies.</p><h4>Do you think your data is being used correctly by the business community in general?</h4><p>Part of SCAD's strategy is to support informed investment decisions by the private sector. The availability of reliable and relevant statistics promotes investors' confidence and facilitates informed decision-making. This mix serves as a platform for balanced and sustainable economic growth in the Emirate. SCAD compiles and disseminates a wide range of official statistics of interest to the business community. These include economic, demographic, agricultural, and environmental indicators. For example, GDP is one of the most important indicators of the economic performance of a country. The FDI statistics show something of the relationship between foreign investors and the Abu Dhabi Emirate. The statistics demonstrate that European countries account for the largest proportion of FDI. SCAD undertakes a number of initiatives to improve the understanding and use of statistics, especially among those in the business community, including investors. These include collaboration agreements and MoUs, advisory committees, and specialized dissemination tools. These collaborations are part of SCAD's efforts to increase the level of cooperation on data sharing and engaging key entities to develop accurate data to support development initiatives in Abu Dhabi.</p><div class="quote">“Part of SCAD's strategy is to support informed investment decisions by the private sector."</div><h4>What have been the highlights of SCAD so far?</h4><p>Since the commencement of SCAD's operations in April 2009, we have taken care to build our capacity as a statistical agency of note. We strive to achieve the highest standards and to implement best practices in the field of statistical work, and we do this by making improvements in terms of accuracy, data quality, and methods of presentation and analysis. SCAD has successfully implemented several major statistical projects. These include conducting large-scale economic and social surveys, and the Abu Dhabi Census 2011. Some surveys are annual, such as the Labour Force Survey, while others are less frequent, such as the Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES). Our flagship publication is the Statistical Year Book, which is a compendium of recent data on the economy, industry and businesses, population, demography, social services, labor force, and agriculture and environment over a period of several years. This is complemented by the Abu Dhabi in Figures series, a compilation of annual key statistics and indicators. In 2012, SCAD released a book titled “Abu Dhabi Over a Half-Century," which covered all sectors of the economy over a longer period from 1960 to 2010. We have many solid indicators and reports, and we intend to remain on that path of producing reliable and comprehensive statistical products. SCAD is currently working on another major project, namely the Abu Dhabi Statistical System, which will automate the flow and processing of administrative data from various entities, thus enabling the compilation of real-time indicators.</p><h4>Are you planning to expand your database to other fields in the near future?</h4><p>SCAD is keen to open new opportunities by working with strategic partners in government and the business world. The current Sport Survey, undertaken at the request of the Abu Dhabi Sport Council, will provide baseline information for planning and policy for sport, recreation, and community health in the Emirate. The Disability Survey is being undertaken in collaboration with the Zayed Higher Organisation, and will produce measures such as disability prevalence rates and participation rates in education and work by persons with disabilities. Thus, we continue to make advances by coming up with new indicators in the economic and social sectors. Recently, SCAD released a new indicator called Expected Inflation, which we will continue to issue every quarter. During the holy month of Ramadan, SCAD produced weekly reports to monitor inflation and analyze how the market fluctuates during that time of each year. We are currently working in partnership with the Abu Dhabi Food Control Authority (ADFCA) on the Abu Dhabi Agriculture Census, collecting data on agricultural holdings, livestock, and fisheries. The Abu Dhabi Statistical System leads the way into the next five years of SCAD's Strategic Plan. It will utilize the e-Statistics system within all participating entities. Development of the e-Statistics system is already well underway and is applying state-of-the art technology. It is expected to be operating by early 2015.  This will make our data easier to be accessed in a timely manner. Our aim is to have all statistical products available in soft copy on the website. By making the information broadly available in this way, the maximum value will be obtained from our statistical work at the center.</p><h4>How do you see your contribution to the Abu Dhabi Economic Vision 2030?</h4><p>By law, the government acknowledges SCAD as the official statistical organization of Abu Dhabi. One of SCAD's strategic outcomes is to ensure sound government policies and decisions based on relevant statistics. Whenever official figures are needed, SCAD is the main resource for statistics. We have assumed the role as the trusted partner in providing timely and relevant statistical products, which support decision and policy makers.</p><p>As such, SCAD is a key player in the pursuit of the Abu Dhabi Economic Vision 2030 under the umbrella of the Executive Council of Abu Dhabi Emirate. We have been an active contributor to the Abu Dhabi Economic Vision 2030 since its first draft, and we update all the data at appropriate intervals. As the provider of latest available data and official statistics, SCAD makes a fundamental contribution to the technical work aimed at achieving the Abu Dhabi Economic Vision 2030. SCAD contributes to the Five-Year Economic Development Strategic Plan, which contains the guiding principles for Abu Dhabi to achieve its 2030 targets. Decision and policy makers use our data to understand developments in the social and business environment and the economy to measure progress of the plan. SCAD provides all necessary data and statistics and it is one of the most trustworthy players involved in achieving the vision for 2030.</p><h4>What are the advantages of SCAD's recent MoU with the Italian National Institute?</h4><p>SCAD has signed several MoUs with key international statistical agencies. The first international agreement was signed with the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) in February 2011 and Statistics Korea (KOSTAT) in September 2012. This year we signed a MoU with the Federal Statistical Office of the Federal Republic of Germany (Destatis), and most recently with the National Institute of Statistics of Italy (Istat) in May 2014. The aim of international cooperation is to boost the technical know-how in statistics especially within the younger generation of UAE Nationals. Building these alliances has supported SCAD's success in hosting the Conference of International Association for Official Statistics (IAOS) to be held in Abu Dhabi in 2016. By raising SCAD's profile internationally and with the transfer of knowledge and experience gained through our international partnerships, we hope for further success in bidding to host the International Statistical Institute World Statistics Congress (WSC ISI) 2021. Learning from other statistical agencies is essential for SCAD to meet its ambitious targets. It translates the vision of HH Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the UAE, Ruler of Abu Dhabi, and HH General Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces, and Chairman of the Executive Council of Abu Dhabi. SCAD is striving to achieve this vision by raising its image in the international arena. I believe SCAD is considered one of the best offices regionally and we are trying to offer our experiences and support to other offices in the region. Ultimately, we need the know-how and technical skills from our international partners to elevate SCAD to be one of the top statistical agencies globally.</p><h4>How do you see your relationship with foreign investors in general?</h4><p>Foreign investors in the private sector represent a significant component of the economy. Building a sustainable economy relies upon mutual cooperation between the public sector and the private sector. When the private sector is strong, the public sector will be strong. We do not want to have any weak areas. We are working toward strengthening our partnership with the private sector through workshops and other projects. In our relationship with the private sector, it is important for SCAD to build positive relationships through various initiatives. It is planned to share our five-year strategy for 2015-2019 with not only the public sector, but also with the private sector. If there are specific indicators that are critical for the private sector, then SCAD will work toward providing such indicators. It is important to extend our support and build trust within the private sector. When we have strong trust, I think we will have a strong relationship. You cannot accomplish everything by law.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Your company is promoted as having the one-stop-shop concept. Can you elaborate on the advantages this concept brings to your company?</h4><p>Intels, a subsidiary of Orlean, is Nigeria's leader in providing logistics services to the oil and gas industry. It manages three ports in Nigeria on behalf of the government, namely Onne, Warri, and Calabar. Intels has a concession created with the government through a public-private partnership (PPP), which started in 2006. Even though the concessions only started then, PPPs were already in place between Intels and the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA). Meaning in a way, the government utilized and promoted an existing successful working relationship. When we arrived in the early 1980s, the logistics challenge was that each company had its own base scattered widely. It was not the best solution, because each new company coming to Nigeria first had to acquire a block, then they had to face office and housing needs, as well as perform seismic activities and commence exploration. If they were able to find something commercially viable, which of course depends on the size of the field, for example, they would have required support from a shore base. Most materials required in the oil and gas industry need to be imported from Europe, the US, Asia, and Brazil. All of these materials have to go through the NPA for security and revenue reasons. The materials were coming to the port, and later transferred to a base. This begs the question of why the moment you receive your cargo at a port, you would again transfer the material, which at the end of the day incurs additional costs and increases the risk of damage. From the moment the company places an order and releases a purchase order for pipes, or any other material, it will normally take at least three to six months before the material enters Nigeria, because the factory needs to produce the material based on the specific requirements. All companies had their bases beyond the port area. Meaning, they were sending materials to the port, clearing it through customs and then transferring it to their own base. When offshore exploration began, oil-producing companies needed a jetty to load the material onto a barge or a supply vessel. However, companies were still sending materials to the port, going to the base, sending it back to the port, and going offshore. We saw the opportunity to convince NPA to give us a lease, whereupon we started pitching all of the producer companies. Eventually, we relocated inside the port to avoid extra costs, and have the opportunity to receive the material at the port and store it in a dedicated area. Then, when it is needed it can just be loaded onto the supply vessel and sent offshore. This way, you avoid double ending, and in terms of timing you are more efficient. This is what we offer with our one-stop shop concept. It did not happen overnight, but companies started relocating to the port. ExxonMobil decided to relocate to Onne for many reasons, namely because it is a free zone and has available essential services. At Onne, we have regular services from a number of shipping lines from Europe, the US, South America, and Asia. Furthermore, the reason Onne became more important is primarily its location in the middle of many of the production discoveries. The other reason is more structural. Today, Onne can have jetties of up to 12 meters at low water. In Nigeria, all the main ports are on the open sea, where you have a low and high tide with a difference of up two meters. We vary from 12 to 14 meters. This is important as the industry moves increasingly into deep-water operations with larger vessels.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on the future plans for Onne oil and gas free zone?</h4><p>For Phase 4A, which was completed and commissioned in 2013, we reclaimed 900 acres of land from the water. Another important investment for Onne oil and gas free zone is represented by Phase 4B, which totaled $3 billion and was made by Deep Offshore Services Nigeria Ltd. The purpose of the project is to develop a further 3 kilometers of jetties, and 3.5 kilometers of differently engineered jetties. Basically, these jetties will have longer lifespans than others, and here the depth is a mere 8 meters. Hence, there will be a dedicated area for the fabrication of infrastructure for offshore modules, jackets, and so on. Therefore, 8 meters is more than sufficient, as the material will be sent out on barges.</p><div class="quote">“We are absolutely in favor of local content, and Intels is a Nigerian company that is 90% owned by Nigerians. "</div><h4>Can you elaborate on how the local content has affected your business and business in Nigeria as a whole?<br></h4><p>The objective of local content is to ensure that Nigerians carry out some of these activities. We do this for several reasons: transfer of knowledge, and revenue that ultimately remains in Nigeria. We are absolutely in favor of local content, and Intels is a Nigerian company that is 90% owned by Nigerians. The local content actually considers the industry from several angles, one being the legal structure. In order to participate in bids in Nigeria, a company needs to have a certain amount of local shareholders, unless there are no companies in Nigeria providing that specific service. In that case, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) will allow certain companies to participate in the bidding process by waiver. Another angle concerns assessing what percentage of the project budget will be spent on Nigeria, or else paid to Nigerian service companies. A third aspect concerns technology, and how these companies might continuously increase their activity in Nigeria. When the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB) approves any project, it does so not only in terms of the technical dimensions, but also the budget, and, therefore, local content is an absolutely practical law. It needs to be in place because Nigeria is the world's eighth largest oil producer; within West Africa, Nigeria and Angola are certainly the two leading countries in terms of oil production. The problem with local content is that you need to have certain infrastructure in place in the country before it becomes feasible. The Nigerian government needs to make sure that there is sufficient infrastructure in place; otherwise, it will never work. Onne is the largest port and support base for the oil and gas industry. Yet, while there are an average of 18,000 vehicles entering and leaving every day, the road is of a poor quality. I believe local content to be both excellent and essential, but still the government should realize that it is also needed to play its part.</p><h4>How is the government working to diversify the economy?</h4><p>I don't see the Nigerian government diversifying. There might be many initiatives, but they have not been implemented. The Petroleum Industry Bill is a good example. While its ratification date remains unclear, it is nonetheless of significance, especially for oil producing companies because it entails their payment of royalties and taxation. If approved, it would be of great significance for these entities. One could debate whether it is fair for Nigeria, the country that owns all of this oil, to generate further revenues. Until the law emerges, the oil producing companies will not invest, as they are to commit to multi-billion dollar projects without knowing whether in a few months their tax rates may or may not skyrocket. There are only a few projects going forward. When Nigeria complains that there are not enough foreign investors, they should look in the mirror and ask themselves the reason. All international companies, producers, or service companies are merely watching and observing the developments. It is quite normal that during an election period investments will stop, because everyone is wondering who will be the next president. Based on that, projects will change. In our case, it is easier because we are developing the ports, meaning wherever the projects will be, they will still need our services. I believe the Nigerian government should try to be a bit more consistent. If there would be a clear picture of where the government wants to go, it could only benefit Nigeria at the end of the day.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the general financial strategy planned by the Ministry for the next five years to maintain the sustainable and solid growth of Panama's economy?</h4><p>A document known as the Medium-Term Fiscal Framework provides estimates about the performance of the economy. The government is aware that in a market economy, state intervention aims best to ensure the stability of public finance, debt sustainability, and the implementation of policies that support private sector decisions in accordance with national growth objectives, social inclusion, and a strong society. To achieve these objectives, we are currently hiring a high-level consulting firm to set the roadmap for the government over the next five years. This work is called the Government Strategic Plan (PEG), where we will bring together structural and long-term analyses to develop best practices and policies.</p><h4>What are the advantages of investing in the Panamanian banking sector, and what is the role of the Ministry of Economy and Finance in attracting foreign investment to the International Banking Center?</h4><p>Given the economic structure of the country, the Banking Center is an essential pillar in national policy. The strong momentum in the expansion of aggregate demand is largely due to the Banking Center funding provided to economic agents in the country. Investing in Panama presents the financial sector with important advantages, among which are the absence of exchange rate problems, and the integration of banking with other segments of the financial services segment, which are currently expanding and to which we are devoting our attention in order to support their sustained development. These financial services include business insurance, reinsurance, and bonds, among others such as a reasonable tax structure, inter-industry links developed with other international sectors within the service industry, and the governmental commitment to ensure conditions of social harmony. If we analyze the composition of FDI, we can see that 28% of the $4.65 billion that came in 2013 were reinvestments and the investment earnings of the banks located in Panama.</p><div class="quote">“The IMF expects Panama to grow 7.2% in 2014, and 6.9% for 2015 according to the World Economic Forum."</div><h4>What are the main challenges facing the financial sector at present, and what kind of regulatory improvements are being made?</h4><p>The financial sector here faces the impact of problems in developed financial markets that have yet to be solved. In addition, we do not have the same regulatory pressures that developed countries put on their financial systems. The concerns related to these regulations on the flow of activities, in terms of additional, explicit, and implicit costs, and their impact on the rest of the world are widely known. Panama has been included on some grey lists for presenting some weaknesses in our economic systems as compared to the standards that the OECD and FATF promote. In this regard, Panama is aware that its leading role in regional business, its international financial community membership, and its integration into the global trade and finance markets are highly sensitive issues when it comes to these perceptions. As long as the country does its best to improve perceptions of our systems, which is something we are already doing, we are confident that the economic ratings our systems have received should not have an impact in the medium to long term.</p><h4>What is your general outlook for the finance sector in the medium term, as well as your expectations for economic growth over the coming 12 months?</h4><p>The IMF expects Panama to grow 7.2% in 2014, and 6.9% for 2015 according to the World Economic Forum, although those forecasts are likely to be revised downward given global uncertainty, especially resulting from the recalibration of the Chinese economy and its impact on the commodity-exporting countries of the region and international geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and Russia. In this regard, our growth expectations are in the order of 6.5%, based on our budget estimates. Locally, the financial sector will continue its upward trend in view of the expectations of the Latin American region in the country. In fact, in March 2014 the local national banking system's loan portfolio increased by 9.4%. However, there are complications in the industrial portfolio and the FTA, and this has reduced the commercial and industrial loan portfolio.</p><h4>Which strategic sectors besides mining and construction will lead growth going forward?</h4><p>We believe that the sectors to highlight for future economic growth are tourism and financial services, as both industries have increased their GDP share contribution over the past decade. We are also in the process of revitalizing the agro-industrial sector (as shown in the strategic plan of the new administration), a key element of plans to revitalize the economy. This sector's contribution to GDP has declined over this timeframe. Transport, storage, and communications today represent 20% of our GDP, and the logistics sector is composed of a variety of industries that have strengthened and transformed our country into a logistics platform of interconnectivity for the Americas. The cluster includes the Panama Canal, the nation's ports, and air and land transport infrastructure. In recent years, the growth rates of these segments have been in the double digits. In 2014, the sector has been growing at a rate higher than 15%, and although it is a sector that is sensitive to developments in international trade, it has proven to be capable of withstanding adversity thanks to a diversified approach to services and customers, as was shown during the international crisis. These are the factors that encourage us to conclude that growth will continue steadily with the implementation of the expansion of the canal, and that the continuity of developments in port infrastructure and the construction of new airport terminals. Panama will continue to develop its vision and to leverage its natural competitive advantage, and its unique natural location.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the success of the Bank of Zambia's (BoZ's) recent steps to restore financial stability?</h4><p>Information filtering from the markets indicates that the BoZ has managed to bring the financial system to an appreciable level of stability after facing challenges that included a liquidity overhang in early 2014 and exchange rate volatility during most of 1H2014. These issues were compounded by rising inflationary pressures. In light of these challenges, measures had to be taken to tighten monetary policy by raising the statutory reserve ratio from 8% to 14% in March, followed by an increase in the policy rate to 12% in April 2014. At the end of May, the BoZ extended the application of statutory reserve ratios to government and other deposits that were not already subjected to the statutory reserve requirement. This was in addition to raising the penalty rate on the overnight lending facility and limiting banks' access to the facility to once a week. Further, commercial banks' compliance with statutory reserves maintenance was reduced to a daily average frequency from a weekly average. The overall effect of these measures was tighter liquidity conditions and an increase in interest rates, particularly interbank rates. However, these measures also helped to achieve relative stability in the foreign exchange market and moderated inflationary pressures. Following the restoration of this balance, the bank embarked on a process of easing liquidity conditions through open market operations (OMO), a policy that has resulted in the decline of interbank rates to levels consistent with the policy rate.</p><h4>How have supportive interventions helped to diversify Zambia's export base?</h4><p>Supportive interventions by the government in pursuit of diversification in areas such as agriculture, manufacturing, and tourism have been helpful in contributing to the diversification of Zambia's export base. This is reflected in the high growth rates posted by non-traditional export (non-metal) earnings. The non-traditional export earnings have rapidly increased over the last 10 years from $392.2 million in 2003 to $3,409.8 million in 2013. However, we need to maintain this growth momentum so that non-traditional export earnings have a bigger share of exports, now at just over one-third, than metal exports earnings.</p><h4>In which sectors and activities do you see the greatest opportunity for growth and export potential?</h4><p>There are opportunities for realizing growth and boosting exports in several sectors of the economy. Firstly, Zambia is endowed with large, arable, fertile, virgin land supported by positive weather conditions and 40% of the Southern African Development Community's (SADC) fresh water resources, suitable for the kinds of tropical and sub-tropical crops required for profitable investment in this sector. The potential for floricultural and horticultural products for export is immense. In addition to creating an attractive environment, the government has identified farming blocks, earmarked for large-scale farming, in which the private sector can invest. It is providing feeder roads, communications, power, and irrigation facilities in these regions. Then there is the huge potential for manufacturing based on agricultural produce as inputs, high-value industrial crops for export, and crop-processing plants such as canning factories and oil processing plants. There is also scope for the development of the beef and dairy industry for local consumption and export. Tourism is the second sector of considerable growth potential and for the generation of foreign exchange. The natural beauty and wealth of wildlife in the country have yet to be fully exploited. There are 19 national parks and 34 game management areas totaling 65,000 square kilometers. In addition, there is considerable room for investment in the hotel industry. Thirdly, the opportunities for further investments in the financial sector still abound to enhance competition and promote efficiency in the delivery of services. Since financing is a key factor for increased economic activity, investment in the expansion of this sector is considered to be a catalyst for economic growth and increased exports. Fourthly, the energy sector in Zambia offers potential, with the capacity to generate hydropower from available water resources. In view of the nation's electricity supply deficit following high growth rates and high regional demand for energy, investment in more electricity generation would spur growth and earn the country more foreign exchange. Construction is also a growing and highly promising sector. As the economy grows, the need for the expansion of infrastructure such as roads, housing, and office accommodation is also increasing, thereby creating investment opportunities for the private sector. For its part, the government has initiated road construction projects such as Link Zambia 8,000, Pave Zambia 2,000, and the Lusaka 400 kilometers road rehabilitation and construction projects, which are expected to create jobs and open up new areas for investment by the private sector. Transport and communications is yet another key sector. Investment opportunities in transport and communications are also available largely due to the size of the country, where people and goods have to travel long distances to well-established population centers as most of the population is in the rural areas. Last, but not least, although the mining sector is the mainstay of the economy, there is still great potential for its advancement. The country has abundant known mineral deposits, about 6% of the world's known copper reserves, and much of this has yet to be exploited, particularly in the northwestern part of the country. Other opportunities include the exploitation of gold, iron, manganese, zinc, coal, nickel, and gemstones, including emeralds, aquamarine, topaz, opal, and amethyst. Diamond and uranium reserves have also been identified.</p><h4>What steps is BoZ taking to boost financial inclusion in Zambia, and what are your targets in this respect?</h4><p>The financial sector has shown tremendous volume growth over time, with total assets increasing from ZMK4.67 billion in 2002 to ZMK45.98 billion by end-June 2014. Despite making significant improvements in all the areas relating to financial viability, profitability, and competitiveness, there are concerns that banks and non-bank financial institutions have not been able to include vast segments of the population into the fold of basic banking services. The latest FinScope survey in Zambia conducted in 2009 indicated that overall financial inclusion had increased by 3.6%, from 33.7% of adults in 2005 to 37.3% in 2009. The level of financial inclusion is now 42% in urban areas and 34.4% in rural areas. This scenario underscores the importance that the BoZ attaches to increasing financial inclusion, which has been adopted as one of the Bank's key strategic tasks with the objective of raising financial inclusion by 15 percentage points to 50% by 2015. This goal is being pursued through a broad range of coordinated interventions, with a high priority on the following: First, promotion of the delivery of banking services outside traditional bank branches through agent banking or branchless banking using additional touch points such as existing retail stores and petrol stations. In this regard, the BoZ has developed a regulatory framework for agency banking to encourage financial institutions to bring banking services to the currently unbanked in all parts of the country. Second, the continued pursuance of the mobile banking and payment system through mobile phones to lessen the cost and address the barrier to financial inclusion brought about by long distances to access points. Zambia is a sparsely populated country with a population of 13 million people across 750,000 square kilometers. Third, the development of a Unified Collateral Registry that will encourage lenders to accept diverse movable property as collateral for credit such as accounts receivable, livestock, equipment, vehicles, and so on, thereby increasing access to finance, especially for SMEs. Fourth, transformation of the existing uniform Know-Your-Customer (KYC) guideline into a simplified Risk-Based Tiered Framework that allows individuals that currently do not have the required formal identification measures to enter the banking system. Fifth, the implementation of the national strategy on financial education for Zambia to empower Zambians with the knowledge, understanding, skills, motivation, and confidence to help them to secure positive financial outcomes. A Financial Education Coordinating Unit was formed and tasked with the implementation of the strategy and developing an index to gauge the depth and breadth of financial services in Zambia. This will enable the Bank to measure the impact of the interventions implemented to increase financial inclusion on a regular basis.</p><h4>What is your medium-term outlook for the Zambian economy?</h4><p>After the liberalization and structural adjustment of the economy in the 1990s, the Zambian economy has strong economic pillars that will make growth endure for some time. This will be supported by the infrastructure development program the country is currently undertaking. There are a number of power plants upcoming, rail and road rehabilitation is progressing well, education facilities are being improved, and new ones are under construction, which include new health facilities. There is a broad-based FDI placement and an increasingly diversified export base. These developments make us confident at the Bank that economic prospects for the medium term are bright. Things are generally looking up in the economy and growth will continue to be robust in the short to medium term.</p><div class="quote">“One of the Bank's key strategic tasks with the objective of raising financial inclusion by 15 percentage points to 50% by 2015."</div><p>© The Business Year - September 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the overall objective of the Arab Media Group (AMG)?</h4><p>Our objective is to be a leading entertainment and media company. Our primary company is Arabian Radio Network, which is the largest radio operator in the Middle East with nine radio stations covering all major demographics and communities living in the UAE. Three of those stations are English services (Virgin Radio 104.4 FM, Dubai 92 92.0 FM, and Dubai Eye 103.8 FM), two are Asian (City 101.6 FM and Hit FM 97.6 FM), and two are Arabic (Al Arabiya 99 FM and Al Khaleejiya 100.9 FM). Additionally, we operate the very first commercial Farsi radio station (Radio Shoma 93.4 FM) and a Filipino station (Tag 91.1 FM) in the Arab region. We reach over 3.2 million daily listeners, along with 1 million unique monthly visitors every to our apps. To complement our objective, we also operate an events company called Done Events, which has been responsible for bringing many large-scale shows to the Middle East, and Dubai specifically, ranging from Jennifer Lopez, Justin Bieber, Bruno Mars, Usher, Katy Perry, and The Eagles, to Eric Clapton and more. We equally source talent for private companies and manage corporate events. Additionally, Global Village is also part of this entertainment-focused conglomerate. With more than 5 million visitors each season, Global Village is the leading open-air family, cultural, shopping, and entertainment destination in the region with more than 65 participating countries, 3,500 shops, 170 kiosks, and over 12,000 entertainment shows per season. Our strategy is to keep pace with Dubai's vision and to reflect it into our own activities.</p><h4>In 2014 you are focusing on Emirati talent in the UAE. Why is it important to accommodate talented locals at Global Village?</h4><p>First of all, we have to acknowledge that we live and operate in UAE, meaning our home base will be a priority. We would not have been able to achieve this growth without the vision and the offerings of Dubai. We have taken advantage of Dubai's infrastructure, logistics, entrepreneur attitude, and ability to attract people. Therefore, our commitment to the city, local community, and roots of growth should be the highest.</p><h4>How will the Dubai Expo 2020 have an impact on Dubai's economy and on your business?</h4><p>Dubai Expo 2020 is one of the largest events Dubai is preparing for, and the increased number of visitors/tourists will have a positive impact on the leisure and events sector. The private and public sectors will all align together in promoting Dubai as the world's number one destination. At AMG, we believe our group has a significant soft infrastructure to offer. All our subsidiaries (ARN, Done Events, and Global Village) are working on enhancing the experience not only for visitors, but Dubai residents alike. A total of 120,000 attended Done Events' concerts in 2013. ARN has invested heavily in its digital apps, which keep listeners connected around the world as well as informed about Dubai's developments. Global Village is a spectacular multicultural entertainment destination attracting over 5 million visitors annually, and we believe it is a reflection of a mini-expo already.</p><div class="quote">“We are privileged to be trusted and offer the opportunity to contribute to the vision of Dubai."</div><h4>What are the major sectors of interest for visitors to Global Village?</h4><p>Last year's statistics show that 29% of the visitors value entertainment activities the most, while 22% of visitors visit the funfair ground, and 25% enjoy shopping. We put a great focus on areas of the highest value for people; as a result, we are investing heavily in infrastructure and quality including collaborations with external parties. This year is the first time we collaborated with a UK-based fun fair operator, the Mellors Group.</p><h4>How would you describe the relationship between AMG and its partners?</h4><p>Our partners are investing their time and resources with us, and we are obliged to ensure that they make the right decision. It is not about convincing people, but offering an attractive business proposition. Global Village has 5 million visitors per season, while ARN has 3.2 million listeners daily, and Done Events caters to 120,000 customers annually. We interact with more than 8 million people every year. We are privileged to be trusted and offer the opportunity to contribute to the vision of Dubai. Addressing all stakeholders' requirements has always been a responsibility, which we are committed to attain.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What can you offer to companies in the Dominican Republic that others cannot?<br></h4><p>I think that the difference between Domex and its competitors is one of approach. We can service each city, town, or province around the Dominican Republic because we have representatives that act as exclusive contractors. They are people who work with us and whom we support with equipment, engines, and vehicles. When we built this network, we adapted and bought all facilities required to be able to deliver anything from a simple letter to a large box. We also created a system that consolidates all documents in one location from where they can be distributed nationwide. We maintain communications with all of our contractors and employees online, which ensures that our clients know the exact moment that their own clients receive their documents via tracking. Today, we move about 5 million items a year in the Dominican Republic.</p><h4>How do you adapt to the needs of diverse clients?</h4><p>Each client has unique requirements, where for example, one may require certain signatures upon receipt. At the same time, the courier may request ID from the recipient to safeguard against error. This is required for documents of high value, such as passports, credit cards, legal documents, and courier packages, for example. When someone only needs evidence of delivery, for example for a magazine, we deliver without requesting ID. Another method involves clients only requiring knowledge of when we have completed distribution. This is common during political campaigns, for example, or for promotions. We deliver these items to every home and building on a specific street. That client won't request evidence of receipt or delivery; they need only know that the document was distributed.</p><h4>What are the company's targets for 2014?</h4><p>Our goal for is to develop a door-to-door delivery service. This will be a first in the Dominican Republic, as currently senders and receivers visit their local agency. This is why eBay and Amazon do not exist here; sellers cannot schedule a door-to-door service, and lack a means of transporting a package to a house. Here lies our future.</p><div class="quote">“I think that the difference between Domex and its competitors is one of approach."</div><h4>Why do other companies not provide this?</h4><p>They lack the network it requires. For example, an exclusive service from your representative, requires guarantee volume and income. They do not work for you. That is the difference—making a commitment to your employees, who should be considered a key partner of yours. This philosophy ensures that both parties are happy. Today, the people who carry out international courier services buy their products in the US and send them to us in the Dominican Republic. But now, we are set to help those who want to buy merchandise in the Dominican Republic. We are giving them two options in a service we expect to launch in 2014.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize the partnership with ENI in the Rovuma basin?</h4><p>Mozambique is one of Galp Energia's core countries in terms of our E&amp;P business, together with Angola and Brazil, which is the market where we have our largest asset base. Given the importance of this market for Galp Energia, we are delighted that the exploration campaign in the Rovuma Basin was an extraordinary one, and probably one of the most successful exploration campaigns in the industry over the past decade. We are therefore delighted with the outstanding work undertaken by the joint venture partners led by ENI as Area 4 operator. Given the significance of our operation in the Rovuma Basin, Galp Energia has been working in close partnership with ENI throughout the exploration campaign. Galp Energia is highly committed to the Rovuma LNG project and will continue to work with ENI and the other joint venture partners to make this outstanding project a success for Mozambique and all investing parties.</p><h4>What does Galp do that makes it stand out in the field of exploration in Mozambique?</h4><p>Galp Energia has significant deep-water exploration experience gained from ventures elsewhere in the world, particularly Brazil. In Mozambique, the exploration is also offshore deep water, so we are able to use the expertise that we have gained from world-class projects elsewhere to benefit our joint venture in Mozambique. In fact, part of the team that has worked in the projects in Brazil is now working for the Rovuma Project. Galp Energia has been operating in Mozambique since 1957, which shows the commitment the company has to Mozambique. As a long-term player in the country, Galp Energia has built a close, long-term relationship with Mozambique's official institutions, which is a positive asset to the whole Area 4 consortia in developing this world-scale project.</p><div class="quote">“Galp Energia has been operating in Mozambique for more than five decades."</div><h4>How do you plan to develop the onshore and offshore infrastructure in the next few years?</h4><p>Currently the Area 4 joint venture is looking at building two onshore 5MTPA trains and we are also evaluating the possibility and viability of building a floating LNG facility in order to anticipate production and revenues both for the government of Mozambique and the Area 4 partners, making use of the large resource base that was discovered in Area 4. We are currently working within the joint venture and with the Mozambique government, both in what concerns the onshore and offshore developments, in order to create the necessary conditions to get all the required approvals and develop the projects in a successful way for all stakeholders involved.</p><h4>What are your thoughts on the petroleum law and the special regime option for LNG projects in the Rovuma Basin?</h4><p>The recent changes in the legal and fiscal frameworks that were approved by the parliament are some of the most important developments of the last few years in the industry when it comes to specific legislation. The projects in the Rovuma Basin will require massive investments, which will be partly financed through debt. For the international financial institutions to be comfortable with investments of this size, it is critical that the legal and fiscal framework guarantees, amongst other things, stability, and creates a conducive environment for investment. The previous Petroleum Law focused on oil rather than gas and thus did not anticipate large gas facilities. While we are still reviewing the new legal developments, this law aims to promote new investments in Mozambique and will allow a new bidding round to take place. According to the government of Mozambique, this new law is in line with the current needs of the country but, like most regulations, there is always room for improvement. The special regimes for the Rovuma project is also a significant item of legislation that is crucial in enabling all stages of the Rovuma projects, both onshore and offshore. The special regimes aim to respond to the specific features of the Rovuma Project and to create the necessary conditions for its final approval, development, and operation throughout the concession period in conditions of economic viability and profitability.</p><h4>How would you describe the significance of Galp for the socioeconomic development of Mozambique?</h4><p>As I've referred before, Galp Energia has been operating in Mozambique for more than five decades and, throughout this period, we have engaged positively with the local communities where we operate. As Galp Energia, we try to make a contribution to the socioeconomic development of the country through two different channels. Within the Area 4 project, the consortia will build/rebuild infrastructure such as roads, schools, and clinics. The Area 4 consortia is also working closely with ENH to develop the study for the construction of a technological training center in Pemba to give both the local population, and Mozambicans in general, the skills they will need to be able to participate in the construction and operation of different facilities of the project. Beyond Area 4 activities, Galp Energia is assessing the implementation of a series of sustainable projects that will have a direct impact on improving the life of local communities. These projects will focus mainly on energy access and energy efficiency, as well as on training and education and will be implemented within the framework of the Mozambican officials institutions of each of the relevant areas.</p><h4>How does Galp work to integrate environmentally friendly practices into its operations?</h4><p>Galp Energia integrates all the industry's best standards in everything it does and, obviously, in all matters related with safety and environmental policies. This comes as a matter of principle, but also stems from elementary good sense because in an industry such as ours, the costs of not putting environmental and safety concerns before everything else are simply too high to leave to chance. A reflection of these good practices is our regular presence in indices such as the Dow Jones Sustainability Index or the Global100 Most Sustainable Corporations selected by Canada's Corporate Knights.</p><h4>What is the significance of Mozambique for Galp's overall strategy in Africa?</h4><p>Mozambique plays a key role in Galp Energia's overall operations, both in our upstream and downstream businesses. Apart from our significant investment in the Area 4 Rovuma Basin project, we are looking into other investment opportunities in the country. In that sense, we will be interested to analyze the possibility of expanding our asset base in Mozambique by assessing new opportunities that may arise in the next bidding round to be launched by INP. Galp Energia is also currently investing in downstream infrastructural projects such as storage facilities for liquid fuels and LPG. This will allow us to consolidate our position in the Mozambique downstream energy market and will also have a positive impact in terms of increasing the storage capacity of liquid fuels and LPG in the country. Our operations in Mozambique will provide a platform for Galp Energia to grow in the region, namely in neighboring countries. Our Mozambican operations will play a central role in our activities in the Eastern African region.</p><h4>What is your 10-year outlook for the operations of Galp in Mozambique?</h4><p>The new political cycle that will come with the next general and presidential elections will open up a long-term development opportunity for Mozambique. We strongly believe that recent political developments, including the newly approved amnesty law, will pave the way for another 10 years of sustained economic development, which we hope will bring social and human development for all Mozambicans. The Mozambique market will increase in importance for Galp Energia and we intend to increase and improve our linkages with the economy of Mozambique. We are investing in improving the technical capacities of our Mozambican staff and we are creating partnerships with several universities, both public and private, which will contribute to develop strong social connections with society in Mozambique. Developing programs in conjunction with Mozambican universities will foster the relationship between academia and the business community, which we believe is particularly relevant for both parties, and has proven to be a successful strategy in Portugal. We also have a strategic partnership with ENH that covers several areas of cooperation. As part of that cooperation program, last year we had eight ENH engineers trained at Galp Energia's HQ in Lisbon for a one-year period in the E&amp;P area, and we aim to make this an ongoing project. We want to continually consolidate and improve our collaboration with ENH, which is a very important part of our development strategy in Mozambique.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Who are your main clients?<br></h4><p>Most of our clients are from government departments. With exhibitions in Abu Dhabi being one of the largest industries, and due to our strong relationship with most of the government entities in Abu Dhabi, they have been the group's main focus. We are implementing projects for Abu Dhabi entities in the country, but are also doing so for them internationally in Brazil, Turkey, and France. In addition, we have organized a number of international events in Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia.</p><h4>Abu Dhabi is an events destination and every month sees a world-class exhibition in this city. How has this high tempo of events assisted your business?</h4><p>Economic growth has helped us expand considerably. In Abu Dhabi, you should provide unique and different services, as clients here are highly selective. They have sophisticated tastes and standards, and pleasing them is not easy. In fact, it is hard to survive in Abu Dhabi without the right creativity and productivity. Our team is very special in that they are creative, productive, and work well under pressure. To give you an example, in 4Q2013, we had 25 projects in the pipeline that needed organizing within just 10 weeks, but we were, as always, up to the challenge.</p><h4>Do you have advice for entrepreneurs establishing a business in Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>I have many friends who would like to start their own businesses, and, based on my education and experience, I now find it easy to carry out business feasibility studies using a series of simple tools. I also encourage them to do their best to identify how to be unique. I have advised a handful of friends, and some of them went on to develop successful businesses. Also, at Zone Group, we try to encourage young, creative people and entrepreneurs. When I hear of young people of potential who are seeking opportunities, we, as a group, try to support them however we can. For example, a young group of women planning an exhibition of hand-made clothes took my advice of establishing an identity through marketing, sponsorships, and putting on fashion shows. We promised to support them in taking their first steps. We also sponsored a photography competition during IDEX on Instagram for the Abu Dhabi Instagram group comprised of talented young Emiratis, to raise their profile at an international level. We also supported them by putting them in touch with the Abu Dhabi government, and the two parties went on to create a calendar.</p><div class="quote">“Most of our clients are from government departments."</div><h4>What do investors need to know about the business environment in Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>Abu Dhabi is booming and is becoming very attractive for investments and business people. There is huge potential with the islands of Yas, Saadiyat, and Reem for sports, entertainment, and business. And what we see now is only the beginning of what Abu Dhabi will become by 2030. Abu Dhabi is one of the most important cities in terms of tourism, culture, events, and exhibitions. A decade ago, when we traveled and explained where we were from, no one knew Abu Dhabi, and we had to mention Dubai for people to be able to figure it out. Yet, over the past few years, it has become well known, and I am sure that within 10 years we will become even more notable. What Abu Dhabi is becoming now is a living legacy of the vision of the late HH Sheikh Zayed, meeting the strategy set forth by the President HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, which is being implemented by HH General Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi. We are lucky and proud to be part of what is happening in our beloved country, and I am encouraging both Emiratis and foreigners to be a part of this region's positive transformation.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You recently acquired a 100% stake in AMNI. Can you explain the reasons behind the decision to do so?</h4><p>First of all, I acquired majority stake in the company. Secondly, the majority of the shareholders who had divested or sold their shares are well advanced in age, and thus have little appetite for risk. The oil and gas business is quite a risky one, and companies who do no invest in their growth will not only stagnate, but also eventually die. Therefore, the decision to bring on board those not averse to taking calculated risks in business was not a difficult one to make.</p><h4>Many of the larger IOCs are currently retreating from the country and selling their assets in the Niger delta region. Does the company have any interest in acquiring new oil fields in the area?</h4><p>We participated in the Shell OMLs 71 &amp; 72 tenders, which we did not win. There are other IOC assets we are looking at. This process is more like reserve-based lending, and, fortunately, we have some ongoing production and are therefore able to leverage this to raise equity. The local banks are aggressive in terms of supporting successful indigenous companies, and the majority of companies to have won these blocks are indigenous. As indigenous players, we bring a different perspective to operating in these environments than the IOCs' current way of doing business. There are opportunities for people who know the terrain to make a significant impact.</p><div class="quote">“The most important thing to know is the imperatives of the oil and gas business."</div><h4>What does it mean for you to be first among indigenous companies in a sector that is largely dominated by foreign companies?</h4><p>It is rather like being the first child of a large family. You suffer all the knocks until your parents learn what it takes for those after you to prosper. It was a difficult period in which most of the licenses granted to indigenous companies were far from bankable. There was no fiscal regime by which to value the return on asset investments, Nigerian banks were busy financing short-term (three-month) lending for product importation, and technical partners who were more street smart came in droves to extract their own pound of flesh. Believe me, it was tough, but today we are grateful to be able to recount a success story. Now we are talking about prospecting for gas. FNLG, methanol, and gas to liquids have become buzzwords for indigenous companies. We have indeed come a long way.</p><h4>Is that where you want to focus your business from now on?</h4><p>No, we cannot produce someone's oil unless they have some way to treat the gas. You also have non-associated gas that can be treated in the long-term at dedicated facilities. Today, we have over 3.2 TCs of gas. This can comfortably support two trains of 5,000 tons of methanol or equivalent product per day. We are now looking in this direction to capture the value of the gas, and we need to be proactive and look for the right market, and not wait for the market to come to us.</p><h4>As the current President of the Nigerian Association of Indigenous Petroleum Explorers and Producers (NAIPEC), what advice would you give to a company interested in the industry?</h4><p>The most important thing to know is the imperatives of the oil and gas business. Some people know the downstream business well and believe it is just as easy to operate in the upstream. However, investing $50 million downstream is quite substantial with manageable risks. $50 million in the upstream will drill only one well, which could easily be dry. So, be prepared, have professionals around you, and have some faith.</p><h4>Diezani Alison-Madueke, the current Minister of Petroleum Resources, foresees an oil and gas industry where 60% of all companies here will be indigenous by 2015. What is your opinion of this?</h4><p>By the grace of god, everything is possible. Nigerian production is at 2.4 million barrels of oil per day (bbl/d). Indigenous companies are struggling to produce 10% of this. By 2015, we should be able to achieve 15% market share. By 2020, perhaps we can reach 60%. The IOCs are the ones with the necessary funds for deep-water production. There are a further 20 or 30 billion barrels of oil in deep-water. I do not foresee much competition between IOCs and the indigenous entities for deepwater play. The IOCs are leaving more difficult terrain, onshore production, and operating where they have better control and more experience in deep-water production.</p><h4>As a geologist by training with over 40 years of experience in the field, where do you see the next opportunities in Nigeria's offshore sector?</h4><p>IOCs are going to keep moving further and further offshore and keep divesting their assets onshore, or in shallow water. The opportunities in Nigeria lie in gas. I think we should be able to capture the opportunities within the West African region before looking elsewhere. I believe that it is easy to succeed if you are not too avaricious and do not have people siphoning your resources elsewhere. I believe in the future of the country and its youth, and I think that people like myself can serve as positive role models for future generations.</p><h4>From a regulatory standpoint, which improvements would you like to see for indigenous companies?</h4><p>The new Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) is taking care of the complaints we have had regarding the fiscal terms under which we operate and opportunities to compete for assets that have been divested by the IOCs. It is difficult for indigenous companies to operate on the same fiscal terms as the IOCs, which are operating large reserves, whereby there is a need for a more favorable fiscal regime.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Juan Manuel Santos visited Spain in January 2014, his third official visit since he was elected. Could you comment on this historic relationship and how this meeting served to strengthen ties?</h4><p>Relations between Colombia and Spain are a good example of multi-partisan continuity in foreign affairs. Regardless of the political orientation of any given government, our bilateral relations are stable, with an intensity only comparable to the bonds that unite us, and our level of understanding. However, when I arrived in government, I wanted to give Colombia the prominence it deserves in Spain's foreign policy. Colombia is now one of the best allies of Spain in the world. Along with Mexico, Colombia was the first country I officially visited as President of the Government of Spain, in April 2012. In May 2013, I returned to Colombia to participate in the Summit of the Pacific Alliance in Cali. President Santos also came to Spain in 2012 for the Ibero-American Summit of Cádiz, and in 2013 he made a stopover that ended up having such fruitful content that it was more of a working visit. Notably, His Majesty King Juan Carlos attended the inauguration of President Santos' second term in office. This was an exceptional trip, the first since his abdication and the first such event he had attended in decades. It is no coincidence that Colombia was the chosen country.</p><h4>Juan Manuel Santos has hailed your initiative of eliminating visa requirements for brief stays by Colombians in the EU. What makes this goal so important for the Spanish government and what did the diplomatic effort to convince Brussels entail?</h4><p>The initiative to persuade the EU to revoke the Schengen visa requirement for Colombia and Peru implied an intense diplomatic offensive, meant to explain the new reality of Colombia. My government and the ambassadors of Spain in the 28 European capitals were mobilized for this purpose. With strong arguments, conviction and determination, we went from just one single country in favor—Portugal—to full consensus in less than three months. Spain showed, with concrete evidence, that it strongly supports Colombia. This initiative was an act of justice. Hence its relevance: there has been a recognition of Colombia's progress, and of the contribution to our development of the hundreds of thousands of Colombians living in the EU. In Spain there are about 400,000 Colombians, a number that decreases as they acquire Spanish citizenship and become dual nationals (more than 200,000 since 2000), demonstrating their perfect integration. Now, for the first time since 2001, their families will come to visit them and they will be able to be together again without the difficulty of the visa requirement. It is an initiative that benefits citizens and, as such, is extremely positive. It is also an acknowledgment of the progress of Colombia in recent years, particularly in terms of economic growth, international integration, security, and social cohesion. The efforts, perseverance, and sacrifices of Colombians have paid off. Colombia's recent governments have made a wise bet in trade liberalization, legal certainty and security. The Multiparty Trade Agreement between the EU, Colombia, and Peru, which entered into force on August 1, 2013, provided a great argument for the abolition of the Schengen visa requirement. Colombia could not be the only country in Latin America, along with Peru, from which the EU required a visa despite having a free trade agreement (FTA) in force. Colombians had to be able to perceive that free trade is good and benefits them directly. With this initiative, Colombians will soon be able to access, without a visa, the largest area of free movement in the world. I believe that, in early 2015, the Schengen visa will have become history for our beloved Colombians.</p><div class="quote">“My government has paid special attention to the Pacific Alliance since the beginning."</div><h4>You have declared that you “believe that the Pacific Alliance is a magnificent idea. It represents many opportunities, more freedom, greater legal certainty and, above all, more jobs, wealth and well-being, here in Spain and throughout Europe." What is the significance of maintaining a close relation with this alliance for Spain?</h4><p>My government has paid special attention to the Pacific Alliance since the beginning. The Framework for the Pacific Alliance Agreement was signed in Cerro Paranal on June 6, 2012. Spain became the fifth observer state, the first from the EU, five months later. Today, there are 32 observer states, including the US and China. Spain must differentially support those countries that believe in trade openness, legal security, and clear and predictable game rules. These countries have strong and independent political institutions that give confidence to investors and public welfare. It is the economic integration process that resembles the most to that of the EU and that has never been seen before in Latin America. Like the EU, the Pacific Alliance has four fundamental objectives: free movement of goods (and the creation of a comprehensive internal market), services, capital, and people. The Pacific Alliance is getting closer and closer to a real and deep integration. To mention only a recent achievement, the incorporation of Mexico into the Integrated Latin American Market (MILA), announced at the IX Summit of the Pacific Alliance in May in Punta Mita (Mexico), means the creation of the largest stock exchange in Latin America in terms of capitalization and number of trading companies, rising from 565 to 986, on an increase of 43%. Let me stress that I wish the same level of success to Mercosur as to the Pacific Alliance. I believe in integration in itself because, as a European citizen myself, I know about its benefits for citizens. The concept of integration implies openness, inwardly and outwardly. I also support the development of Mercosur and its relations with the Pacific Alliance, which could boost intra-regional trade, so far limited to 20%.</p><h4>What areas will Spain and Colombia focus on, and how do you foresee relations between both nations developing in the medium term?</h4><p>Colombia and Spain must constantly raise their level of ambition in terms of bilateral relations. We are two countries with a special tune and therefore a willingness to cooperate in all areas. Spain has long been betting on Colombia. Spain has been betting on Colombia for a long time. We have never had doubts about Colombia's capacity to overcome the adversity of conflict. If a peace agreement is finally reached, as it is our wish, Spain will be there, offering whatever cooperation Colombia may need. On the other hand, we have numerous companies with international experience that are already contributing to the development of the infrastructure that Colombia needs, as illustrated by the expansion and modernization of the iconic El Dorado airport in Bogotá, among other examples. Climate change, rural development, science and technology, energy, and talent mobility are just a few areas we can work together on. Nothing from Colombia is alien to us, and everything that is Colombian interests us. In fact, we should note that despite the crisis, Spain's investment in Colombia continued to increase, from ‚¬5.79 billion in 2010 to ‚¬6.12 billion in 2012, an increase of 5.7%. The increase in Spanish exports to Colombia is spectacular; between 2009 and 2013, exports rose by 97.2%. With the entry into force of the Multiparty Trade Agreement between the EU and Colombia on August 1, 2013, we can expect that our trade to increase further and reach the level we should aspire to. Spain also needs Colombia, especially its companies, and the talent and resourcefulness of Colombians. Colombian companies are internationalizing, in Central America in particular. It's time for them to come with conviction and determination to Spain, which offers nothing less than the entry door to the world's largest integrated market, the EU. I think we should target higher Colombian investment in Spain, a figure that currently stands at only 30 million. In this sense, we need to take advantage of the full potential of the Multiparty Trade Agreement in force between Colombia and the EU. This FTA includes a national treatment clause, by which Colombian companies may invest in Spain like Spanish companies, with the same facilities and without discrimination. I hereby encourage Colombian companies to invest in Spain, with a long-term perspective, taking advantage of this great new opportunity. Finally, Spain will continue to support Colombia in its further international integration, as we have done for the country's coming entry into the OECD, the club of good government practices for the most advanced countries. Colombia also helps Spain, as it did for our entry into the Pacific Alliance as an observer state. As I said at the Universidad Sergio Arboleda in Bogotá when I received its Doctorate Honoris Causa on April 19, 2012: I believe in Colombia, and I say it wherever I go.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have bilateral ties between Panama and Guatemala developed in recent years?</h4><p>The ties between both countries are deep, strong and dynamic, and over the past few years, they have only improved—the level of interaction has positively increased. However, I would also like to highlight ties between both countries within the Central American Integration Systema (SICA). Panama has grown at a rapid pace over the past few years, and it would be exceptional if we could spread such a trend to Central America through the SICA.</p><h4>Since both countries recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to boost trade, what are, in your opinion, the sectors with the greatest potential to deepen relations?</h4><p>Tourism is one of the sectors that sees a kind of monopolized trade relationship between both countries; however, I see a very interesting potential in infrastructure projects and energy (including renewable energies), as well as many others. These will be the first steps to build even deeper and stronger trade ties between Panama and Guatemala. Let me only add that there are already ongoing projects in these fields that have the participation of companies from Panama.</p><div class="quote">“We have grown closer over the years, and our common ties have reached people and communities from both countries."</div><h4>To what extent has the marked decline in violence in Guatemala City impacted cooperation between both countries?</h4><p>Over the past two years, Guatemala City has seen a 37% decline in homicide rates, coinciding with my tenure as President. We have already held fruitful meetings with Panama to boost the transfer of technology, intelligence, and communications that will ensure agility in tackling issues such as transnational crime. Over the past two years, we have strengthened ties between both countries in this field to make sure that current information is immediately at hand to tackle these problems.</p><h4>How do you see bilateral ties evolving over the next few years of your term?</h4><p>Bilateral ties between Panama and Guatemala were already excellent before I took over the presidential office, and I truly expect them to remain positive over the years to come. We have grown closer over the years, and our common ties have reached people and communities from both countries.</p><h4>What conclusions did you draw from the World Economic Forum on Latin America hosted in Panama City?</h4><p>First of all, I would like to congratulate the President of Panama and its people for the milestone achievement of bringing such an internationally high-profile forum to our region. The event has set a precedent for future regional development, having placed Central America in the spotlight of international attention. Guatemala hopes to organize an equally high-profile event within the coming years. The World Economic Forum provided us and certain other nations with the opportunity to showcase regional developments and invite foreign investors to consider our countries.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What would you say are the highlights of your operations as well as your growth strategy in the region?</h4><p>American Express Middle East (AEME) is a joint-venture company. We are the issuer and acquirer of American Express Cards and merchants across the MENA region.  American Express has been operating in the region since 1959, and in 1992 American Express Middle East was established as a joint-venture company owned by American Express and Mawarid Investment Limited. One of the most important highlights of our operations is that we have been successful in supplying reliable, effective, and rewarding solutions to consumers, corporate clients, and merchants across the region. All of our products and services are characterized by outstanding quality and service, and demonstrate our commitment to delivering positive and enriching experiences to our Cardmembers and partners. Our ability to do this is enhanced by our operation of a spend-centric model, which means our revenues are generated by the spending power of our Cardmembers and the business that we drive to merchants rather than lending and revolving receivables on credit cards. On the corporate side, we like to say we are a one-stop shop for businesses to manage their expenses, be they travel, entertainment, procurement, or other business expenses. We offer two key business products: The Business Travel Account (BTA) and the American Express® Corporate Card. Both of these products help businesses better manage their expenses, including travel and entertainment, by offering them greater transparency and control and ultimately delivering cost savings. With the Corporate Card, we also offer businesses a purchasing solution that helps them manage operating expenses such as payment of customs duties, utilities, and supply costs. I think another highlight of our operations is our ability to offer products and services that meet the demands of consumers. Today, consumers are becoming more demanding, and what they demand is value and rewarding experiences. For example, we offer true value with our rewards scheme, which is best in class. The American Express Membership Rewards® program is the leading rewards program in the UAE and across the Middle East. It is the only program that offers access to 12 major international airlines where customers can redeem their points against airlines tickets and upgrades. Points can also be redeemed for hotel stays, shopping, car rental, restaurants, and charities. Customers earn points for virtually every dollar they spend. These points build up and never expire, which is unique across the market. One of our key strengths is also the strong partnerships we have created with our merchants, which enable us to provide value-added exclusive offers not only in our region, but also globally for customers. For example, with the Selects„¢ program, our Cardmembers can access a range of regional and global offers. Meanwhile, merchants benefit from spending by our loyal Cardmembers. In addition, I think one of the highlights that underpins our business is service. Our business strives to provide personal recognition and tailored services to our Cardmembers, be it consumers, business customers, or merchants. Our commitment to providing outstanding service runs through our organizational culture and is innate to the values of our organization and our staff, too. This is something that other companies often do not have and is not easily replicable.</p><h4>How would you differentiate the market in the UAE compared with the others you are experiencing?</h4><p>The UAE has it all. It has a solid local customer base that spends on various everyday products, luxury goods, and experiences both locally and abroad, and also welcomes millions of visitors every year. It has become a well-respected and well-known destination for business, often serving as a hub for businesses as they open up their operations to serve the rest of the region. One of our objectives is to ensure we prioritize our investments in a selective manner to ensure we invest in markets and segments that deliver business growth, and in this sense the UAE is a key priority market for AEME. For example, one of the key trends that we see in the GCC region is that consumer spending on goods and experiences is growing, with the UAE spearheading this growth.</p><div class="quote">“Technology is at the core of our business. Without technology, our business cannot run."</div><h4>What is the importance of technology and innovation at AEME?</h4><p>Technology is at the core of our business. Without technology, our business cannot run. Beyond technology is telecommunications and robust infrastructure. I am pleased to say that over the past few years we have invested significantly in our technology infrastructure with best-in-class technologies, be it hardware, software, or telecommunications. For example, we have undergone a significant investment in implementing a new technology platform for our business in the Middle East that brings all our products together on a single platform. What that allows us to do is to offer even better service to the customer as we have achieved an even more comprehensive view of them and how we can support them. I believe digital is also an important aspect of our business. One of our goals is to maximize the share of American Express card spend online and also improve the online customer experience. For example, to improve the customer experience, our website has been mobile-optimized and we have launched a Facebook page to interact with customers and communicate special offers. We have launched mobile applications, which enable customers to look up their card accounts, pay their bills, check their balances, and put in service requests. Ultimately, convenience is the name of the game. Customers are more demanding of the highest standards of service and digital is a key channel that helps maximize customer engagement and deliver our service promise.</p><h4>What are you doing to strengthen your position from your point of view in terms of avoiding any possible mistakes in e-security?</h4><p>We offer a number of services that are core to our business. First of all, we educate our customers on the importance of not divulging personal information, and not only their card numbers, but also their personal details, and to ensure their passwords are kept secure. In addition, we have in-house models and sophisticated tools to ensure we anticipate or predict whether a transaction is suspicious or not. Therefore, if we detect through our internal models a suspicious transaction, we actually either cancel that transaction or generate an alert and call the customer for verification. We are also investing in American Express SafeKey®, which adds another layer of security for online transactions by allowing the customer to register and enroll in the service and then for every transaction online, they receive a unique password that would verify that transaction should be processed. Last but not least, we work closely with law enforcement agencies and authorities on combating fraud.</p><h4>In regard to the Experience UAE program, how do you structure your offers, and who have you partnered with to create this customer experience?</h4><p>Experience UAE offers American Express Cardmembers visiting or living in the UAE access to hundreds of specially negotiated savings with leading names in travel, retail, dining, and leisure. One of the strengths of the program is the fact that we work with strong partners. These are very reliable, well-known partners that are willing to put exclusive offers on the table. American Express is a global brand, and that allows us to promote Experience UAE and its exclusive offers to American Express Cardmembers all over the globe.  That is a key aspect of why Experience UAE has been important for us and very successful, too. In addition, the success of the Experience UAE campaign is driven by the 360-degree communication channels used, including a strong emphasis on digital, such as the development of a dedicated microsite which is compatible with mobile devices and includes useful visitor information as well as access to the offers.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In light of your official visit to Abu Dhabi in June 2014 with high-level UAE government officials, what are the areas of joint cooperation currently underway between Slovakia and the Emirate of Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>Slovakia considers the UAE, together with other partners in the GCC, an important member of the international community seeking peaceful cooperation and supporting positive development in different parts of the world. My official visit to the UAE was aimed at elaborating on the mutually beneficial cooperation between our countries in various fields, including economic cooperation, trade, and the extension of the contractual and legal bases. In that respect, we have discussed with our Emirati partners the possible implementation of joint ventures. Of course, we are also looking forward to intensify the political dialogue and cooperation in multilateral forums. Slovakia exports to UAE many traditional commodities such as automobiles, products made by our engineering and defense industry, medical technology and equipment, decorative glass, and the highest quality crystal glass, special foodstuffs, and mineral water/soft drinks. We also provide medical services and spa treatments, such as balneotherapy in the Slovak spa town of PiešÅ¥any, which is popular in GCC countries. We are witnesses to a steady growth in the trade exchange between Slovakia and the UAE; however, what we cannot be satisfied with is the total volume of trade. We have much more to offer to each other, therefore the contacts between our authorities and business communities should intensify in order to identify new forms of cooperation. The growing importance of our mutual relations and our firm belief in their further strengthening led us to the decision to open our Embassy in Abu Dhabi in 2013. I am sure that this step will help boost our cooperation, especially in the economic and trade area.</p><h4>About 2,000 Slovak citizens live in the UAE today, and this number is expected to increase. What are the factors attracting Slovakian citizens and companies to live and set up base in the UAE?</h4><p>The UAE government is striving to achieve a harmonious balance between economic development and sustainable development, between openness to the world and the preservation of traditions. Confronted with major international challenges, the UAE projects an image of dynamism and responsibility to the world that commands respect. We all know that the lifestyle and infrastructure of the UAE places the country high on the list of employment destinations for many expatriates. The UAE is one of the most important global financial and trade centers. It is an important crossroads in air transportation, a country of large investment projects, which attracts businessmen from all over the world due to the high business potential and free financial capital flows. The UAE is attractive for young people due to dynamics in the development of the country. Slovakia became, both at home and abroad, a synonym for a country with outstanding science and technology, where exceptionally educated and creative people produce high-quality and innovative goods and services. The Slovak community in the UAE works mostly in the airline industry and for major global IT companies like IBM, Dell, and Microsoft.</p><h4>You presented draft agreements to the UAE Minister of Foreign Affairs HH Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al Nahyan against double taxation and on investment protection and promotion at the Abu Dhabi meeting in June 2014. What effect would these agreements have on the economic ties between Slovakia and the UAE?</h4><p>We are well aware of the fact that in order to facilitate the broadening of bilateral economic cooperation, we need to speed-up the process of establishing a basic legislative framework. Therefore, we intend to successfully conclude negotiations on two agreements dealing with the promotion and protection of investments and the abolition of double taxation. The signing of these two agreements will create favorable conditions for bilateral economic cooperation and can give additional assurance to investors that their investments will be adequately protected.</p><div class="quote">“The UAE government is striving to achieve a harmonious balance between economic development and sustainable development."</div><h4>Agreements such as visa exemption for Slovak citizens entering the UAE and the recognition of Slovak driving licenses have been put into effect in 2014. What is the significance of these agreements?</h4><p>I would like to once again thank the UAE for the decision to exempt 13 EU member states—Slovakia included—from the need to acquire pre-entry visas to the UAE. This will enable Slovak citizens to travel to the UAE more often, and I am convinced that the UAE could easily become one of the top holiday destinations for Slovak tourists. I would like to emphasize that the agreement on the mutual recognition of driving licenses between the Slovak Republic and the UAE is not in effect yet; the legislative process has barely begun. We hope that we will be able to sign this agreement in the near future and increase the quality of life of Slovak citizens in the UAE.</p><h4>During your visit, you opened the Slovak-Emirates Business Forum in Abu Dhabi. What areas of untapped potential in the Abu Dhabi economy do you envision becoming the focus of continued cooperation in the upcoming years?</h4><p>Slovakia can support Abu Dhabi's efforts in economic diversification and build a knowledge-based economy through investing in the sectors that are envisioned by the Abu Dhabi Economic Vision 2030. We look to contribute to the sustainable economic development process in the Emirate by participating in joint investment projects supported through know-how and technology transfer, all the while providing specialized education and training together with our UAE partners. Our vision is that Slovakia will be a business hub that connects and supports businesses between Abu Dhabi and the EU. We would like to attract knowledge-based, innovative, and value-added businesses in Abu Dhabi and provide opportunities to Abu Dhabi businesses to have a presence in the EU through our global business network. The main sectors of mutual cooperation are in the areas of air transportation, defense-specialized industry, software services, and products and information technologies for government institutions, as well as for the financial sector, railway carriages and transportation technologies, infrastructure development, oil and gas drilling technologies, construction, specialty foodstuff production technology, equipment for power stations, decorative and crystal glass, and mineral water/soft drinks. We would like to enhance cooperation in healthcare, including pharmaceutical products, medical equipment, and specialized physiotherapy and spa treatment (balneotherapy), as well as tourism. Within the framework of possible cooperation, we also see room for cultural cooperation and education. Slovakia has a tradition of long standing in providing specialized physiotherapy services and education combined with the modern medical science. In Slovakia, there are unique natural resources—more than 1,200 mineral and thermal springs, many of a healing nature. Our 22 spa resorts provide complete medical care and offer effective treatments based on usage of mineral and thermal waters. I cannot omit mentioning that Slovakia has excellent conditions for enjoying active holidays in summer and in winter. More than 40 well-equipped ski resorts with seven five-star ski resorts, 12 golf resorts, marked cycling tracks, mountains suitable for hiking, trekking, and mountaineering, and rivers and lakes suitable for water sports are waiting to be explored.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>Moody's Investors Service recently awarded Chartis a Ba1 Rating. What is the significance of the rating for you?<br></h4><p>Moody's has assigned a Ba1 rating to Chartis Kazakhstan for the first time recently, the highest rating among non-governmental insurance companies in Kazakhstan. This is almost guaranteed to boost our business development prospects.</p><h4>Chartis has traditionally focused on corporate clients. Are you also interested in focusing more on the retail market?</h4><p>In Kazakhstan, our company is an absolute leader in bancassurance. In fact, we are partnered with the top-10 banks. We aim to keep the customer at the center of everything we do—from how we sell, to how we support and pay insurance indemnities to them. It is our goal to maximize customer satisfaction and become the insurer of choice in our selected product fields, namely accident and health, travel, loyalty and plus products, and personal property insurance. Sustainable customer satisfaction is what we emphasize. We are introducing innovative products, and this is the only way we can survive in a soft market environment; we are introducing new products and features, and new distribution channels, with the highest possible service standards.</p><h4>What are the insurance sector's prospects for growth over the medium term?</h4><p>Our projections indicate that the market will grow by an average of 13% per annum over the next five years; however, the official government projection for GDP is a conservative annual rate of 6%. In 2013, Chartis Kazakhstan grew by 22% in net premiums written due to new business and a change in obligatory reinsurance agreement conditions. The main contributors to our 2012 profit were casualty, financial lines, and the accident and health lines. The company maintains its position as the first provider of choice for business travel insurance and is a main provider  of credit-card related transaction insurance.</p><div class="quote">“  The main contributors to our 2012 profit were casualty, financial lines, and the accident and health lines. "</div><h4>How has the market changed over the last three years?</h4><p>It is worth emphasizing that the market's segmentation is changing. In the past, insurance companies were focused predominantly on corporate clients in the oil, gas, and industrial sectors. Now, this picture is changing; we have a larger number of diverse clients. The regulatory environment makes it more difficult to rely on only a few large accounts, and, consequently, insurance companies are diversifying their portfolios. Of course, from an insurance regulation point of view, this is a positive step because, by being less reliant on the large risks and large clients, it improves risk diversification. We are happy that this is happening because the regulator is quite comfortable that we are taking the risk, as we have large capacity: energy $250 million, property $250 million, marine cargo $85 million, auto $200 million, and casualty $100 million.</p><h4>What insights did you gain from the first Directors and Officers (D&amp;O) Liability Insurance Conference in November 2012?</h4><p>The key objective of our conference was to organize the platform for open discussion between potential and existing clients, insurers, and brokers. It was also aimed at strengthening AIG's leadership position in financial lines products, promoting the AIG brand, and laying the base for further contacts with companies' decision-makers on D&amp;O insurance. During the second D&amp;O Conference in November 2013, we concentrated on D&amp;O insurance. Strong growth on exposures ranging from increasing litigiousness, and the globalization of business activities, to the global economic downtown leads to the high level of directors' liability risks. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that directors may require protection against such risks. The best way to protect directors and companies is through D&amp;O liability insurance. A further conference will be dedicated to questions related to the duties of boards, the basis for charges against directors, the advantages of purchasing D&amp;O insurance, and other related issues.</p><h4>What is your outlook then for the rest of the year and 2014?</h4><p>The outlook is positive. We expect stable growth of at least 20%. I presume growth will be even higher in 2014, as our own internal capacity is growing.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Given Kazakhstan's experience of the hydrocarbon sector, how is it set to strengthen its position as one of the global leaders in the market?<br></h4><p>The oil and gas industry is not just one of the main sectors of the economy, it has been active for 50 years in Kazakhstan, which aims to become a world leader in hydrocarbons exploration, extraction, and transportation. KazMunayGas (KMG) is, therefore, particularly prominent in this sector. KMG Group is a national Kazakhstani operator representing government interests in the oil and gas industry. It is a vertically integrated oil and gas holding operating in line with international safety standards, and comprehensively oversees production processes from the exploration and extraction of hydrocarbons, to refining, processing, shipping, and special services. The company aims to rank in the top-30 oil and gas companies in the world in terms of oil reserves and production. We plan to increase liquid hydrocarbon deposits to 1.413 million tons and oil extraction to 35.4 million tons per annum by 2022.</p><h4>What is the current KMG production status, and how are you planning to increase production in the future?</h4><p>In 2013, KMG Group achieved most of its key targets. For example, oil and gas condensate extraction grew by 6% on the previous year to 22.6 million tons. Gas extraction has grown by 12% to 2.93 billion cubic meters. Approximately 67.2 million tons of oil were transported through the KazTransOil system over the period. In 2014, we plan to reach the 72.1 million ton mark. The major changes in the oil transportation sector resulted from the Caspian Pipeline Consortium's decision to increase transportation capacity. The first stage of this project in Kazakhstan is expected to be completed in 2014. A project to increase the transportation capacity of the Atasu-Alashankou pipeline to 20 million tons per year will allow the transportation of both Kazakhstani and Russian oil to China across Kazakhstani territory. The construction of a third Asian pipeline has also begun, and will allow the supply of an additional 25 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas through Kazakhstan to China. The construction of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent (BBS) gas mainline started in September 2013, and is scheduled for completion by 2015. The estimated capacity of the BBS pipeline is 10 bcm a year. Currently, the volume of gas transported has reached 110,135 bcm (109,189 billion in 2012). There has been some growth in oil refining, too. KMG plants refined 16 million tons of oil in 2013, and this year the number will grow to 17.4 million tons. We have commenced the reconstruction of the Shymkent and Pavlodar refineries. We are also building an aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) production complex at the Atyrau oil refinery, and a bitumen production facility in the Mangistau region. Profits from core business activities have grown by 10% to KZT3.257 trillion. Overall, KMG's net gain rose by 24% to KZT456.8 billion in 2013. KMG paid KZT622 billion in taxes and fees for the year (KZT599.4 billion in 2012). Production growth was underpinned by increased hydrocarbon reserves resulting from successful geological exploration. In 2013, the company concluded a four-year geological analysis of 15 sedimentary basins located in Kazakhstan. Recoverable reserves of liquid hydrocarbons were proven (in 2013) at 811.6 million tons. Production was 50% compensated for by the increase of commercial reserves to 11.5 million tons. In 2013, an exploration well was drilled in Zhambyl, and there is a deep-well being drilled in Urihtau. KMG links the further development of the hydrocarbons resource base with geologic exploration on the Caspian shelf and deep land sediments. In early 2013, after tentatively launching Kashagan, KMG and its partners announced recoverable commercial reserves discovered in two oil deposits in the Kazakhstani sector of the Caspian Sea. The growth of recoverable reserves reached 98.6 million tons, yielding a full 67.6 million tons in terms of the Kalamkas sea reserve and 31 million tons of oil at the Hazar reserve.</p><h4>President Nazarbayev set a goal for Kazakhstan to become one of the world's leading economies by 2050. What is the role of KMG in this strategy?</h4><p>The President has set long-term priorities for the development of the oil and gas industry. In particular, increasing production efficiency through the use of innovative technologies and the expansion of the geological exploration of hydrocarbon reserves are focus areas. Through KMG's status as a national gas and oil operator, the company will participate in these activities and set up a technological center named the Drilling and Production Institute, which will become a technological center. The institute will monitor geological and geophysical data and carry out laboratory research in geology, geophysics, and production technologies. Another priority is to increase hydrocarbon reserves through further geological exploration. The results of these studies were summarized in 2013 in an atlas of the potential oil and gas regions of Kazakhstan. The President has also set a goal of building a new (fourth) oil refinery. Meanwhile, the application of regulations will allow for a rebalancing of the remuneration system and ensure a stable workforce. Employees and their families are granted access to a social security benefits system that comprises financial assistance, social allowances, and other guarantees. In line with regulations, KMG employees are granted medical treatment in the event of a work accident, as well as maternity allowance, and other services.</p><div class="quote">“  KMG plants refined 16 million tons of oil in 2013, and this year the number will grow to 17.4 million tons. "</div><h4>Considering KMG's leading position in the national energy sector, how will the company participate in World Expo 2017?</h4><p>It is commonly acknowledged that energy-saving technologies are the future of the sector. All affiliated KMG Group companies apply eco-friendly, waste-reduction, and energy-saving technologies. For example, the implementation of the automatic electricity monitor and control system at the KazTransOil company has resulted in savings of 4 million kWh a year. The use of energy-saving technologies at the Pavlodar Oil Refinery has also allowed for a reduction of electricity consumption by 30.7 million kWh and thermal energy by 39,400 Gcal. Accordingly, specific energy consumption requirements to produce 1 ton of oil have declined by 7.7% and 6.7% for electricity and thermal energy, respectively. There is a gas turbine power plant under commission at the MangistauMunayGas Kalamkas deposit, the capacity of which is 2.45 MW. This natural gas fuelled plant will wholly compensate for increased electricity demand, resulting in cost reductions. Energy-saving practices have resulted in a continued declining trend in energy consumption.</p><h4>What are your international ambitions for Kazakhstan's oil and gas sector?</h4><p>To date, the largest overseas asset of KMG is Rompetrol, operating in a number of European countries. Rompetrol utilizes the most innovative refinery in the Black Sea region and operates a network of over 1,000 gas stations. Through the purchase of a 75% stake in Rompetrol in 2007 and the remainder in 2009, KMG is following a strategy aimed at expanding key European markets with a potential 300 million customers. Simultaneously, Rompetrol has allowed for the creation of an integral well-to-customer cycle, involving the trading and shipping companies of the KMG Group. Our affiliated company, KazMorTransFlot, entered the oil transportation market through the Black Sea and Mediterranean Sea in 2012. Unfortunately, Europe's oil refining and distribution sector is facing a crisis, as a result of which we have shifted our focus to the Romanian market.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you tell us about project milestones since 2009, when the North Caspian Operating Company (NCOC) became the official operator under the NCPSA?<br></h4><p>Since 2008, I have had the privilege of working here in Kazakhstan as Chairman and Managing Director of NCOC, the delegated operator of Kashagan and other fields within the contract area on behalf of the seven venture partners. The history of NCOC dates back to January 22, 2009, when the new joint operating company took over from Agip KCO as the sole operator under the North Caspian Production Sharing Agreement (NCSPSA). In terms of milestones, several merit specific mention. One of these was reached in July 2010, when the well operations team at Agip KCO safely passed a total of 220 kilometers of wells drilled since work began on the consortium's first well, Kashagan East-1, back in 1999. The team has safely drilled more than 40 wells to date. To put this achievement into perspective, 220 kilometers is the equivalent of over 600 Eiffel Towers. The most important milestone was, of course, the start of production in September 2013. Unfortunately, due to certain technical issues we had to cease production thereafter, and today are now working toward a safe resumption.</p><h4>The Kashagan field is regarded as one of the largest oil discoveries of the past 40 years. How will it influence the market once it achieves full production?</h4><p>This is not just one of the largest oil discoveries of the last 40 years, but also one of the world's most complex industrial projects and the largest oil and gas project currently being undertaken. I am convinced that Kazakhstan's first offshore oil and gas project will play a significant role in fostering a better future for the nation. Beyond oil and gas development, our mission is to make a strong and sustainable contribution to the development of the local and national economy of Kazakhstan by generating substantial tax and royalty revenues. At its peak, the project has employed over 40,000 people, while thousands of Kazakhstanis were trained, infrastructure built, and thousands of local companies prospered. We are committed to the continued enhancement of local content development for the benefit of the Kazakhstani people. To date, we have invested over $10 billion in the local economy, which makes us one of the largest investors in country.</p><h4>What have been the highlights of your development strategy for the Kashagan field?</h4><p>The strategy, given the size and technical complexity of the Kashagan field, involves development in phases. Phase I, known as the Experimental Programme, has been completed, while further phases of development are at the conceptual stage, and being discussed with the government. As with any large-scale industrial project of this nature, various options and opportunities to optimize project development are being considered by the operator.</p><h4>Considering your expertise in the sector, how would you rate the oil and gas sector here in Kazakhstan, and which trends do you foresee for the coming years?</h4><p>With 30 years of experience working for Total in various places around the globe, I strongly believe that Kazakhstan has huge potential. With its enormous oil and natural gas resources, Kazakhstan can become one of the top oil exporters globally. And this is not just my view, but moreover that of international oil experts. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), world global oil demand will continue to rise until at least 2020 and Kazakhstan's role as a supplier of global energy needs will continue to grow.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How far has Halyk Bank progressed toward being Kazakhstan's number one bank?<br></h4><p>If we talk about the period since 2011, then we can see that Halyk is continuing to grow as a bank and business. We have, on average, around 5%-9% annual growth in total assets. Net profit is increasing at an even higher rate and, overall, the loan portfolio is increasing by an average of around 10%. In 2012, the major milestones were that we approved the new strategy for the bank for the next three years. We are on target to become the number one bank in Kazakhstan. We are number one in most market segments, including net income, retail deposits, and total deposits, though we are not number one in terms of total assets. This is the main target for us. We will also continue to grow and develop in the other markets in which we're present: Russia, Georgia, and Kyrgyzstan. We are diversified in regard to products and clients. In 2012, we approved and looked at a new strategy on dividend payments, where we said that Halyk Bank will pay dividends on common shares each year amounting to 15%-50% of consolidated net profit. In 2013, we already paid dividends on common shares within the framework of new dividend strategy. Also in 2012, we established a new company, a subsidiary of Halyk Bank, which is to deal with the management of distressed assets. This was allowed under new regulations to oversee the cleaning up of bank balance sheets.</p><h4>It is expected that the merging of Kazakhstan's pension funds will be completed by the end of 2Q2014. What impact will this have on Halyk Bank?</h4><p>Halyk Bank was offered BTA Bank shares in exchange for our pension funds. With more than 33% out of overall pension assets under management in the pension system, we have the biggest pension fund in the country—even larger than the state pension fund. It is the best pension fund in the country in terms of quality of assets, branch network, and presence around the country. For us, it is bad news that we are losing part of our commission business, which was profitable for us. We were earning fee and commission income of $100 million per annum on average from the management and administration of pension assets. At the same time, if you look at the total income of the group, the income derived from the pension fund was around 10%, meaning it is not extremely significant, but in terms of commissions it was quite significant. Despite this, we have been growing in accordance with our targets in the retail business, more than 20%, while corporate banking is growing around 10%, SMEs are growing around 15% for medium companies, but in small companies there is no growth.</p><h4>What were the main drivers for such growth?</h4><p>We are outperforming our budget, improving net interest income, and generating new commission business. These are the major drivers, and it is because portfolio growth is better than we expected. The rates were conservative, but we achieved a better result in our portfolio in the commission business despite the negative news about our pension funds. They are not performing on the budgeted numbers because pension assets today are not invested properly. The National Bank, in January, brought in an embargo that does not allow the investment of pension assets in corporate securities. Over the year, pension assets were only invested into government securities or deposits, which were mostly current accounts because there was no long-term strategy for the pension funds. Overall, the returns on pension assets on the country this year are much lower than usual. That is why the income from the pension funds is lower than we budgeted. Our net income will be around KZT74 billion.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Sberbank commenced its operations in Kazakhstan in 2006. How much has the Bank grown since that time?<br></h4><p>In fact, the bank has achieved some strategic objectives. When the subsidiary bank came to Kazakhstan, it had a short-term, three-year strategy to tap a 1% market share, and to win trust and create a solid reputation among citizens and the clients of the bank. One year later, having demonstrated qualitative growth in all indicators, Sberbank became one of the 10 largest banks in the country. The strategic goal of the bank's development until 2015, for example, to occupy a 5% market share, was achieved ahead of schedule in 2012. In regard to assets, the current share is 6.8%. According to the results of 2013, the bank's assets grew by more than 40% to KZT1.035 trillion. As of today, Sberbank has the fourth largest assets among Kazakhstani banks. It should be noted that for the entire period of its operations in Kazakhstan's financial market, Sberbank has not paid any dividends; however, it has reinvested its profits in infrastructure, IT development, the introduction of new products, and service quality improvement.</p><h4>Could you describe the 2018 strategy that you recently implemented?</h4><p>We have now commenced the implementation of a new strategy for 2014-2018. This process does not involve only the subsidiary bank in Kazakhstan, but the whole Sberbank Group. A customer-oriented approach, efficiency, up-to-date technologies, responsibility to clients and the community, and decision-making maturity are what we will rely on to move forward. Clearly, the numerical indicators will be pronounced; however, it is critical that we achieve qualitative objectives through efficiency. We are going to become the leader in Kazakhstan's import/export operations in those countries where Sberbank has its resource groups. Today, Sberbank is present in more than 20 countries. The development of relations with regional countries, such as Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan, are very significant to us, too. Our clients' business interests are focused in these countries, and we will make every effort to provide them with convenient, high-quality services.</p><h4>Sberbank JSC is a member of the Sberbank international group. What benefits is this associated with this, and are there any preferences for your clients' servicing in other countries?</h4><p>Our membership in the Sberbank international group is evidently associated with a number of benefits. Therefore, the parent bank's brand ensures our high recognition and a safety margin, which is significant for the ratings, if required to back up liquidity. On the whole, the Group follows a policy according to which every subsidiary bank must ensure its continuous and sufficient liquidity on its own. This approach allows for the avoidance of risk multiplication. At present, we have maximum ratings, whereas the loan portfolio delinquency ratio is minimum and the liquidity cushion is large. Besides, we can conduct banking transactions via the Sberbank Group, which in fact gives us an additional advantage in terms of speed and cost of the transactions. As to preferences for services available to our clients in other countries, in 2013 we extended the coverage of the Unified Tariff Area (UTA). Now, it is possible to withdraw cash from Sberbank cards for free at the Group's banks in five countries: Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Turkey, and Croatia. Sberbank's clients have duly appreciated this advantage, as the number of payments has grown by 200% within UTA.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>One of the main goals of KazTransOil is to improve the oil transportation network, as well as the import and export of oil products in Kazakhstan. What is your strategy in pursuing this goal?<br></h4><p>KazTransOil, being the national operator of the Republic of Kazakhstan over the main oil pipeline, manages the development and integration of the domestic system of main oil pipelines as the main priority of its activities. This involves an array of arrangements aimed at improving the reliability of facilities for oil transportation and throughput, the competitiveness of services, as well as creating the necessary contractual framework for oil transportation through the territory of transit states. KazTransOilseeks to maximize its involvement in existing and new oil pipeline assets in the Republic of Kazakhstan, as well as in major international oil transportation projects. KazTransOil has carried out extensive work over a period of 17 years to modernize and upgrade the production infrastructure; more than 1,000 kilometers of major pipelines were replaced, while 60% of them now have a renewed tank farm; four oil loading/unloading rail racks were built and reconstructed, and the capacities of oil terminals in the port of Aktau were increased. We worked on the Alibekmola-Kenkiyak and North Buzachi-Karazhanbas pipelines, as well as the Atyrau-Samara section of the Uzen-Atyrau-Samara main pipeline. In addition, we rebuilt existing oil pumping stations and new ones were constructed. Progress was also made with the Tuimazy-Omsk-Novosibirsk-2 project. Moreover, the SCADA automated control system was introduced in the company's facilities.</p><h4>How will further oil transportation system development increase the energy security of Kazakhstan in the years to come, and what will be your role in reaching this target?</h4><p>The energy security of the country largely depends on progress in the development of the fuel and energy complex, which in turn has numerous feed forward and feedback effects in all sectors of economy. One of the pillars of sustainable development for fuel and energy is the effective functioning of the multi-vector oil transportation system of hydrocarbon supplies to domestic and foreign markets. Given the country's plans to develop the promising fields of the Caspian shelf, the issues of transport system development are becoming increasingly important, particularly taking into account the geographical location of Kazakhstan away from major world oil outlets. Kazakhstan currently has a diversified, multi-vector system for the transportation of oil for export. Existing export pipelines such as the CPC, Atyrau-Samara, and Kazakhstan-China provide access for Kazakh oil to Europe, to the terminals of the Black and Baltic seas, and the Chinese market.</p><h4>KazTransOil owns a 100% share of Batumi Terminals Limited, which has the exclusive management rights over Batumi Sea Port. How would you characterize your operations in Georgia and the region?</h4><p>Batumi Industrial Holdings Limited (BIHL) provides services for the throughput and storage of hydrocarbons, the throughput of dry cargo, as well as other services for transshipment through the Batumi Oil Terminal and Batumi Sea Port in Georgia. The strategic goal of acquiring these assets on the Black Sea coast was to establish an important alternative oil transportation corridor with direct access for Kazakhstani oil and petroleum products to the liquids market. In doing so we have ensured the presence of Kazakhstan in the Black Sea and taken control over this strategically important route for the growing oil exports from the Caspian region.</p><h4>What future projects are you planning in the medium and long term?</h4><p>The company has approved a number of investment projects aimed at improving the reliability and safety of oil transportation facilities, meeting the needs of the oil industry for transport capacities, diversifying export destinations, and creating economically attractive routes for shipping. Medium-term projects include the second phase of construction of the Kazakhstan-China pipeline, reconstruction of the Kalamkas-Karazhanbas-Aktau and Uzen-Zhetybai-Aktau main oil pipelines, and increasing the capacity of Batumi Sea Port. The further development of the Kazakhstan-China pipeline involves an extension of the full capacities of this pipeline system by up to 20 million tons per year, with an appropriate guaranteed resource base being made available.</p>]]></richbody0content>

KazAtomProm comprises a number of technological councils, including the Central Technological Board and corresponding councils for every strategically important area: the nuclear fuel cycle, renewable and alternative energy, rare metals and rare earth metals (RM &amp; REM), and chemical technologies. Every council is composed of renowned Kazakhstani scientists. Apart from that, KazAtomProm has joint ventures with the research departments of our partner companies from Japan, France, Canada, Russia, and China. There is an affiliated company, the Institute of High Technologies (IHT), and an innovation support institution, the Kazakhstan Nuclear University. The university was established to provide nuclear industry professionals with training and retraining, with particular interest to innovation and new technologies. This organizational structure has proven efficiency and ensures the leading position of KazAtomProm in the nuclear industry. We aim to increase capitalization by adding up our intangible assets. The company pays special attention to developing new technologies, know-how, and patents. Over the past four years, we have attained more than 100 patents in nuclear technologies.</p><h4>How can Kazakhstan develop the real potential of the nation regarding its vast resources?</h4><p>Kazakhstan has abundant natural resources. We have significant explored reserves of ferrous and non-ferrous metals, rare metals, and hydrocarbons, including substantial quantities of natural gas and petroleum deposits. Kazakhstan also has great potential for wind, solar, and hydro-based power. Indeed, the potential exceeds the country's consumption rates. Kazakhstan ranks second in uranium reserves. And, currently, it ranks second in uranium production in the world after Australia, having outstripped not only Russia, but Canada as well. KazAtomProm also produces tantalum, beryllium, and niobium. There are a few countries in the world with the capacity to produce tantalum and beryllium, and Kazakhstan is among them. Considering resources, I'd like to add that the company's policy, parallel to government policy, focuses on using the resources as an asset to develop technologies and to create high-tech joint ventures. KazAtomProm is a perfect example of international cooperation. We also collaborate with major research institutions such as Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge University.</p><h4>What is the role of KazAtomProm in developing nuclear plants and nuclear energy?</h4><p>We have five nuclear installations. One of them is a commercial sodium-cooled fast breeder reactor. Since 1999, the reactor has been under decommissioning. There are four experimental nuclear installations. Three of them are located at the Semipalatinsk nuclear test site, and the other one in the Almaty region. We have qualified scientific and technical staff. The government has decided on launching new nuclear power plants, and our personnel will take part in this process.</p><h4>What is the role of technology and innovation at KazAtomProm, as well as in developing Kazakhstan's resources?</h4><p>KazAtomProm is not a research company; we're an industrial company. We develop only those areas that can be profitable. Therefore, we deal with renewable energy sources, and solar and wind power specifically. It's worth mentioning that we use mainly our own technologies, which ensure our leading position in the tremendous renewables market. Our production plant for photovoltaic modules will be open for visitors during the World Expo 2017 in Astana. There is also a sports center that is completely powered by green energy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Rio Tinto is one of the world's largest mining companies, and its portfolio differs from region to region. Which segments represent the core of your operations in Kazakhstan?<br></h4><p>At this stage, our focus in Kazakhstan is essentially on greenfield exploration. We are open to advanced stage projects, but we are presently not involved in any active mining in Kazakhstan. The company's view is ideally to find its own resources via exploration or via acquisition at the early stage. Our focus here is very much on finding new deposits and our team is an exploration team, as opposed to an engineering or mining team, and the primary commodity we are looking for is copper. However, Rio Tinto is a multiple commodity-based company—we are not so much commodity as opportunity focused and, although Rio Tinto is recognized as a leader in iron ore, coal, and copper production, if the economic drivers change the company will pursue the best value opportunities within the sector, irrespective of the commodity.</p><h4>How do you plan on dealing with logistical difficulties once the exploration phase is over and mining operations start?</h4><p>Our activities are currently very much focused on exploration, and there is a great deal more work and studies to be completed before we potentially look to develop a mine. Over time, as any project progresses, we will have to look at how we can work closely with the government and communities while developing appropriate infrastructure for future mining operations. In Australia, for example, much of our iron ore is in a remote part of the country. But, over the years, Rio Tinto has supported the development of the required infrastructure and now there is an excellent private rail network. It services a large set of iron ore deposits that are highly valuable, and the cost is fully justified. This also highlights a key aspect of our exploration strategy; availability of infrastructure is an important consideration for both the commodities we explore for and selection of targets—resources in remote areas will need to be of exceptional quality to support the installation of infrastructure.</p><h4>What is your opinion on Kazakhstan's fame for its friendly business climate?</h4><p>Kazakhstan provides a friendly business environment, and I certainly feel that people are very open to talking about opportunities. Behind that, there is still quite a large set of challenges in establishing a business here, being able to effectively deliver exploration programs, and navigating the complex legislation. There are still significant bureaucratic challenges to overcome in process and transparency before it will be a completely open business environment.</p><h4>What will be your main investments in the future?</h4><p>Our future investment is much results based. If our exploration projects generate the positive results we are hoping for and, importantly, if we can be confident of the continuity of rights from exploration through to production, we will seek to make further investments and increase our exposure here. We certainly believe that there is significant potential for the discovery of additional world-class copper deposits in Kazakhstan, and we would like to be at the forefront of that discovery cycle. We are working closely with the government with full transparency and are proud to be considered its strategic partner, whereby we will be able to support the reinvigoration of the exploration and mining sector. We are open to business with any other reputable companies that are operating here, and will do that transparently and ethically and ensure all our activities are adding mutual benefit, not just for the company and the government, but essentially for the people of Kazakhstan.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the key milestones and developments for Aristan group over the past two years?<br></h4><p>We continue to work on strengthening the position of our companies in all the fields that we cover, such as construction, property, and our facility-management business. We established and opened a property evaluation firm, which is today actively working under the consulting group. As for the construction business, we initiated our own heavy-industrial construction division, which participated in one of the largest construction projects in Kazakhstan, a new Kazakhmys plant in the Northern Pavlodar region. We assisted in raising the metal structure, and in building the facility's campus for the project. The general contractor was Alsim Alarko, and we were coopted as a subcontracting company. We continued our work on residential buildings in Almaty, in the Aktau region, and also carried out general construction projects all over Kazakhstan and the Caspian bloc. As for property management, our company has been doing very well, opening two more business centers, and a property management center over the past year. We are also providing cleaning and facility-management services to shopping malls. We are continuing with smaller projects as well, and in the property evaluation business we work closer with the banks and property owners.</p><h4>Kazakhstan ranked an impressive 49th overall on the World Bank's 2013 Doing Business rankings, but only 155th when assessed on its construction permit system. To what degree do you see this as a barrier to growth in the sector?</h4><p>We do still have problems with construction permits, which first have to pass through complicated procedural systems for obtaining the technical utilities permits, the construction site approval from the municipal architecture department, as well as a permit from the constructing control departments. Progress has been made, with the elimination of specific construction permits in 2013. It is a major step that saves around two months in obtaining a construction permit. The government is determined to eliminate barriers, and is decreasing the number of licenses required for construction projects. Additionally, both local and international companies can function as a general contractor and acquire permits for an international design company. It is important and necessary that the government urges these international companies to work with local companies, so that construction projects become localized. That is where we step in as a local partner. With an English-speaking staff and an outstanding team, we are ready to work as true local partners to provide solutions and continue what we have already been doing for several years.</p><h4>How is the private construction sector working with educational institutes to address this skills shortage?</h4><p>I think that every mid-level company is working on the issue. We are negotiating with the National Academy of Architecture and Construction, and we would like to have our own program, starting with classes for project management in construction. We are interested in producing high-level designers. I think the approach of state educational institutions are highly theoretical and outdated, and an unfortunate inheritance of the Soviet system. We are also partnering with international companies. In 2014, we participated in an expo with Gansam from South Korea—one of the top-30 international architectural design companies. Such partnerships are beneficial for our team. We witnessed the methodology it employs in running the business; its project management is completely different. Also, its deliverables production approach and design quality are completely different; it is very customer-oriented. I have seen what it does, and I can clearly say that unfortunately neither we as a sector, nor Kazakhstan's largest design institutions, have the necessary vision for development on such a scale just yet.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is KazAgro's strategy for the development of the agriculture sector in Kazakhstan?<br></h4><p>The major goal of KazAgro is to ensure the food security of Kazakhstan. At the same time, we also aim to improve national export potential. KazAgro focuses on developing markets for agricultural products, providing the financing needed to create new farming facilities as well as guidance on issues related to the establishment of new facilities, and assistance in the trade of agricultural products. In effect, it allows assistance in the financing of the sector and ensures agricultural companies have access to bank loans at low interest rates. We also provide business assistance on issues related to the optimum use of science and innovative technologies.</p><h4>How would you rate the infrastructure of the sector in Kazakhstan? Which area is most in need of improvement?</h4><p>Traditionally, the key segments of agriculture were crops and livestock. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Kazakhstan managed to retain its crop production. Currently, we are trying to improve the livestock component, as there is significant export potential, considering the Russian market, and the growing demand for beef and lamb. In terms of crops, we are improving oilseed production, which has higher added value. We are currently considering setting up infrastructure for the processing of crops, fruit, and vegetables, as well as for the production of wool. These are the major agricultural areas of export potential.</p><h4>Are you looking to new markets?</h4><p>Currently, we are trying to expand in China and Iran. This said, we need to assess whether it is necessary to expand our exports while Kazakhstan remains a member of the Customs Union, and there are certain restrictions on exports. The Customs Union market comprises 170 million potential customers, which is more than sufficient for our capacities. The Russian market is an extremely large one, and we are currently discussing the possibility of entering the Moscow region and others including the Ural and Siberian markets. There are 18 million people living in Moscow, which is comparable to the total population of Kazakhstan.</p><h4>Do you think that the agricultural sector will play a role in the long-term diversification of the economy?</h4><p>One should acknowledge that Kazakhstan is a country with an agricultural sector that dominates the economy. Its potential is significant, especially considering global food-safety issues. At present, we are not effectively using our full territory. Moreover, it is possible to diversify our product offering, although currently we are focusing on just a few crops. If we manage to develop the oilseed, meat, and crop sectors, it will already have quite a significant impact on the economy. KazAgro is not responsible for defining areas for development. We mostly work in investment and finance, in areas defined by the Ministry and the President. We aim at setting up production, delivering investments to producers, and ensuring that products comply with high-quality standards and are competitive globally. In 2013, KazAgro acquired the BBB+ rating (Russia has a BBB rating), which is quite impressive. This has allowed the national holding to borrow approximately $1 billion overseas. These foreign investments are essential for the further development of the sector. One of our fundamental principles is to attract foreign investors instead of domestic borrowings.</p><h4>What is your opinion on the role of the agricultural sector in attracting foreign investments?</h4><p>KazAgro plays quite a remarkable role in attracting foreign investments. When foreign investors enter a market, they need to understand the investment climate and find reliable partners. As long as the holding remains a quasi-government entity, it is easier for foreign investors to establish working relationships with us. Our credit rating is another asset. Since 2013, we have been working actively with leading global companies on entering the Kazakhstani market. We will now be scoping for measurable results of our efforts.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Will Kazakhstan become a hub for medical technology within Central Asia?<br></h4><p>Yes, absolutely. Just recently, the President addressed the topic of medical tourism. One of our objectives is to make our hospitals and centers highly attractive to people from all over Kazakhstan and our region. At this point, in some fields of medicine, we already have certain activities aimed at this goal. For example, in cardiac surgery, we host visitors from diverse countries. We have patients from Russia, the US, Canada, the Middle East, and elsewhere. We plan to broaden this activity and establish special marketing departments and activities in order to provide more information about our capabilities. We can organize medical assistance, both surgical and therapeutic, and, of course, this will raise people's understand that we operate highly sophisticated facilities. Moreover, we have a raft of ideas to render our health offering still more attractive. For example, we made the decision to have our centers Joint Commission International (JCI) accredited. Once we have this medical accreditation, we will be among the few medical centers in the Central Asian region to boast such capability.</p><h4>How will the partnership with Nazarbayev University evolve?</h4><p>This for us is one of the most important issues. When National Medical Holding (NMH) was established, it was not a part of Nazarbayev University. Yet, a recent decision has led to this status. One of the main focuses for us is to develop a sophisticated scientific capability. We are still working toward this goal. To make it absolutely clear, post-Soviet medical and healthcare science is not comparable to what is available in the US and certain Western European countries. We are working to bring these technologies here, develop a research capability, and train our researchers so as to transform our centers into centers of research, away from solely being medical centers.</p><h4>How would you rate NMH's international partnerships?</h4><p>We have six different centers. Our cardiac surgery center, for example, might be considered one of the best based on the volume of work it receives. We are one of a small number of countries with capabilities in devices specialized for cases of chronic cardiac emergencies. We were selected as one of just five test countries in the world for a new cardiac assistance device to help the heart work better, which is currently being developed in the US. To be part of this speaks volumes about our capabilities. We plan to start work on artificial hearts in 2014, or at the start of next year, to help surgeries and complete the artificial heart project. In terms of surgical capabilities, we have sophisticated techniques to remove brain tumors, and have developed new techniques for the surgical treatment of epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, and other conditions. For example, at this center—in a first for Kazakhstan—we carried out a liver transplant from an adult to a six-year-old child. The donor organ was transplanted into a child who otherwise had just weeks to live. We perform this kind of surgery on a regular basis. We have recently opened a pediatric oncology department and a hematology department. We work with brain tumors and carcinomas and are planning to become a regional entity in Kazakhstan for the treatment of childhood cancer.</p><h4>How do you plan to work in preventative medicine?</h4><p>Many say that it is easier to prevent a disease than to treat one. In many cases, this is a rather empty claim as while we know what should be done, physicians understand that in many cases, preventative medicine has not been developed. Everyone is talking about preventative medicine in the US and Europe, but ultimately it largely depends on people themselves—what we eat, drink, and whether we exercise or not. No government can oblige people to take exercise, for example. However, at the same time, educational activities in the field of medicine should be in place.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you tell us about the history of the company?<br></h4><p>When our company was established, there were just four stores, and we were representatives of the retail company Kaz.Yuvelirtorg. Later, the number of stores increased to 40. Following the restructuring of the economy, many shops were forced to close, and Kaz.Yuvelirtorg is unique in being the only company to have survived. In fact, today we are known as the Kazakh jeweler, and have also moved on from simply trading to manufacturing jewelry as well. In the past, there was no manufacturing sector in Kazakhstan, and the restructuring of the Soviet economy was a difficult time for our country, as relations with outside countries were severed, and we faced the real possibility of not being able to import sufficient goods for the population. The population became more interested in jewelry in national style, which was the reason we started our own production. Our manufactured products include wedding bands, a wide choice of national jewelry, and exclusive orders and requests. We are continuing to increase our manufacturing production power year to year.</p><h4>How would you describe the process of jewelry manufacturing?</h4><p>We source raw materials from within Kazakhstan. The National Bank and private mining companies support us in these operations, and we work with modern, high-quality Italian and German equipment. We have invested in top-level training for our staff, and have also hired a number of experts with extensive experience. We manufacture a wide range of products in addition to high-quality individual orders. Popular products include complete sets with earrings, a pendant, and a ring, while classic pieces are always in high demand.</p><h4>What products are in high demand at the moment and who are your core clients?</h4><p>Today, our customers are roughly 80% from the middle class, with the remainder being upper-class clientele. The public demand for jewelry of the highest quality, such as rubies and sapphires, is rising. At the same time, we have organized the Gemological Center with specialists in the assessment and determination of stones. Leveraging this expertise we guarantee full compliance of the characteristics stated on the labels of our products. We often arrange exhibitions sales to salons, where gemologists enable customers to evaluate stones and make the right choices.</p><h4>What differentiates you from competitors in the market, and what are your plans?</h4><p>We differ from competitors in that we are a symbol of quality, and have had satisfied buyers for the past 72 years. Our slogan is “trust is a time-tested quality." We count Russia, Italy, and Hong Kong among our many partners. Our primary partner is the Russkiye Samotsvety Corporation in St. Petersburg. We attend international exhibitions, and are well connected to other countries, bringing our stability and quality beyond Kazakhstan's borders. Our motto for 2014 will be “quality of staff and service improvement," which will be our primary focus for the year. We currently have shops in 16 cities across Kazakhstan, and our future plans include the expansion of our network of salons and boutiques at large shopping centers, allowing us to reach more of our clients. Ultimately, we hope to educate our customers about stones, meaning that the Kazakhstani public can become discerning connoisseurs of jewelry.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were some of the key reasons behind the establishment of Korem in the energy sector?<br></h4><p>Following the fall of the Soviet Union, Kazakhstan, as well as Russia, launched reforms targeted at the transition from the centrally planned economy to a market economy. The energy sector is of prime importance to the country's welfare; therefore, Kazakhstan embarked on restructuring this area. Kazakhstan has advanced greatly in power sector reforms. The vertically integrated monopolistic sector has been unbundled, most of the generation plants privatized, and a competitive wholesale market developed, with a modern grid code. In effect, the main power producers could compete for customers. It was necessary to provide both power suppliers and consumers with an electronic trading platform. This is how Korem was established 12 years ago.</p><h4>Which service is at the core of your portfolio, and how have you developed it?</h4><p>Let me describe how a power trading market works. The participants are sellers—power generating companies (mainly state-owned Kazakhstani power plants)—and buyers. Generating companies offer a certain amount of electricity available at a certain time on a competitive basis. Korem operates as a transparent power market. All transactions between sellers and buyers are performed electronically. There are numerous electronic power trading platforms across the globe. For example, there is Nord Pool, and many more similar markets in Europe. Remarkably, Korem was the first e-trading power market in the CIS countries, and was established before the Moscow Energy Exchange.</p><h4>How many clients do you serve?</h4><p>To date, about 90% of the power capacities are traded directly between power plants and consumers, following bilateral contracts. The remaining 10% are traded through Korem.</p><h4>What is your opinion about the electricity market in Kazakhstan, and how do you see it evolving in the future?</h4><p>Kazakhstan is an emerging economy, and GDP keeps growing. In the last two to three years, the annual GDP growth rate was 6% to 7%. Obviously, an emerging economy demands more power capacity. During the past two years, energy consumption has been increasing by 3% to 4% a year. We expect this trend to continue into the foreseeable future.</p><h4>What is your opinion about government efforts to promote green solutions while simultaneously considering nuclear power?</h4><p>At present around 80% of Kazakhstan's electricity comes from coal-powered plants, and about 10% from gas-powered or fuel oil-powered generating facilities. The rest comes from hydroelectric sources. Thereby, it is clear that 90% of electricity is generated through traditional technologies that utilize non-renewable resources. Currently Kazakhstan's development strategy has increasingly integrated environmental protection and sustainable development considerations and focuses on developing renewable and nuclear energy to replace conventional high-emission technologies. Notwithstanding the priorities, I would expect that within the next 10-15 years the lion's share of power would still come from solid fuels, although the share of traditional power plants will gradually decline. I suppose it will account for no more than 15%  of all produced power.</p><h4>Do you see the development of this trend in the medium term or will it require more years?</h4><p>I expect the first high-capacity nuclear power plants will be launched within the coming two decades. Therefore, there is a growing emphasis placed on nuclear energy as a means of reducing dependence on traditional energy resources. Kazakhstan ranks second globally in uranium reserves, too. There is a developed uranium industry about to start producing uranium fuel. The projects are currently being considered for their feasibility. By the time the first nuclear power plant is launched, Kazakhstan will need to train highly qualified human resources to ensure safety. This will take a significant amount of time.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>How has DHL Express grown and developed over the past 18 months?<br></h4><p>VLADIMIR YATCHENKO Business is good here, and we are growing at a rate of 22%, which is well above the growth of the transportation index and the air freight growth statistics provided by the Ministry of Finance.</p><h4>Have you seen a higher demand for DHL Express' services?</h4><p>We have seen strong growth in Almaty, Astana, and surprisingly in Aktau, as well as in Shymkent. If you look at cities like Ust-Kamenogorsk (Oskemen), where there is a lot of non-ferrous metal production, they are struggling. Meanwhile, Karaganda and Temirtau are seeing a slowdown. I assume that is because the Chinese are not importing as much steel; hence, there is a slowdown in Kazakh steel exports.</p><h4>How has the opening of DHL's new Service Center near Almaty airport improved its ability to service its customers?</h4><p>We have tripled our capacity, and eliminated bottlenecks in terms of our ability to process shipments.</p><div class="quote">“  Since 2008, we have doubled our turnover in Kazakhstan, even during the global financial crisis period. "</div><h4>How has the Customs Union benefited DHL?</h4><p>Among our key trade lanes, Russia is growing rapidly, and is by far the largest portion of our international business today. What we see is a slowdown in countries such as Italy, and I think that is on the back of the Kashagan Field starting to come online, as there had been many Italian companies involved in the initial set up. The Customs Union is good for us, as we can now provide an overnight service from Astana and Atyrau to Moscow, which is a market-leading service. Most of our international competitors still deliver via Europe.</p><h4>How does DHL differentiate itself from its competitors?</h4><p>I believe that for our customers, what is important is our footprint in the country. What you find is that we are in 21 cities, and you perceive a uniform DHL feel nationwide. In Astana, we have a relatively small operation in the larger scheme of things. However, it is the largest in the city and continues to grow. We invested three years ago, and are now operating at 100% capacity, and will now need to reinvest in facilities in Astana to efficiently process the business volume. Obviously, along with that come all the challenges of technology, people, and processes, for example. Any company can buy vehicles and say “we are a transportation company." However, only a few companies have their own network, and in Kazakhstan DHL has three. We have the widest coverage, the best transit time among other courier companies, and the widest product portfolio. This allows us to absolutely satisfy any customer expectation and demand in Kazakhstan in terms of the fastest possible delivery. Our biggest advantage is the presence of the international network, because we tie directly into it, which is perfect for us. In terms of the oil and gas industry, we are the only company that uses Atyrau as a gateway, which is important. We have our own bonded warehouse and facility, whereas everyone else has to use the airport bonded warehouse and facility. We have the ability to get our goods cleared at DHL, which is important. It speeds up the whole process and also provides us with better control, which obviously satisfies our customers. What you will find is that most of the throughput going to TCO will reach our warehouse. DHL is now among the top-500 Kazakhstani companies in terms of logistics and size of business, and is the only transportation company to have made this list.</p><h4>Where does Kazakhstan fit in to DHL's regional strategy?</h4><p>Among the CIS and Southeast European countries, such as Serbia, Macedonia, and Croatia, DHL Kazakhstan ranks second after Russia in terms of size of business, despite a population of just 17 million. Kazakhstan is, therefore, important for international business as a prominent investment address. Since 2008, we have doubled our turnover in Kazakhstan, even during the global financial crisis period, and today have more than 5,000 regular customers, practically all being international companies. DHL is effectively a barometer of a country's economic health.</p><h4>How crucial is employee development to DHL Kazakhstan's success?</h4><p>People are important, especially for our production platforms. We have back office people such as myself, but the people that make the difference in our business are our couriers, and those processing shipments and getting packages to aircraft. Last, but not least, is our customer service team, which is involved in interacting with customers and problem solving for clients. In relation to this, with both a global and local perspective, we have a program called Certified International Specialist. It allows all our people around the world to unify their knowledge and skills. This is because we pursue the same procedures in all markets, using the same equipment and technology. Our courier could easily be transferred from Kazakhstan to Rio de Janeiro—they would have absolutely no difficulties in making a pick-up and delivery. Within DHL's borders, this isn't difficult to do.</p><h4>How is DHL helping companies achieve emissions reductions targets?</h4><p>We operate a fleet of 90 pick-up and delivery vehicles. With the type of vehicle that we purchase, the focus is clearly on CO2 emissions. We work in step with our supplier, and when procuring vehicles we opt for the most advanced European-type vehicles that can run on Kazakhstani fuel. Secondly, we consider our carbon footprint with each investment. Lighting and energy consumption also present reduction targets for us.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is Interteach modernizing and expanding its medical facilities?<br></h4><p>It is being done within the framework of transferring the government's clinics from the Ministry of Health—polyclinics and medical establishments. We are participating in this collaboration, and are prepared to take it upon ourselves because we have a great deal of experience in managing the networks of our own clinics. We aim for a world-class level of quality. To this end, we are conducting the accreditation of our own medical clinics with international accreditation organizations that have rating systems and agencies. We are seeking partnerships with international companies, in particular medical services enterprises. We are joining with them to offer a wider range of services, as well as to bring in their expertise and experience. It is clear that the industry is changing rapidly, with advances in medical equipment being made constantly. Therefore, it is important that we stay abreast of all these changes and developments. We are now updating our automated security system of so that we can offer a higher quality level of services, and of course we are training our personnel, meaning that they can operate the new equipment and integrate the new products seamlessly. Training and internships are also to be provided in collaboration with the government on the basis of an official partnership.</p><h4>How do you perceive the general standard of medical services in Kazakhstan, and how can they be further improved upon?</h4><p>The healthcare situation in Kazakhstan is much better than it was 20 years ago. The positive impact of reforms has been demonstrated by a great many indicators, and there has been a significant amount of attention paid to the personalization of services to an individual's needs. During 2012, a state program was implemented involving all clinics in every region of Kazakhstan. The result of this was a decrease in indicators, such as the overall mortality rate and the infant mortality rate. As concerns the attractiveness of Kazakhstan to investors, it has been noted that the country is an attractive place to work, particularly for medical personnel. Interteach has about 15% expatriate staff, who have come here to seek new opportunities, which is proof they are indeed here to be taken. Moreover, it is clear that the government is prepared to cooperate closely with the private sector in the healthcare field. This is a good sign because we will definitely be able to help the government in reaching international quality standards within a short period of time. It will be possible to see the establishment of a national healthcare center that will be able to compete with the most well-known international clinics. At the new center, specifically with regard to international specialists, the expatriate ratio is at least 50%.</p><h4>How will mandatory healthcare insurance affect Interteach and Kazakhstan's health sector?</h4><p>Over the next three years, this focus will include social services, the budget, and the government, and will have a positive effect on the population, especially in terms of the provision of services. In the medium term, there is a plan to institute mandatory health insurance, whereas up until now we had worked with voluntary health insurance plans. The model for mandatory health insurance had been discussed before, but never implemented. The government's budget has already been estimated to include this model, and it is expected to go into effect by 2015 or 2016. As for Interteach's medium-term development plan, we are working out the particulars of that right now. We are planning to start up a partnership with a company that will not only attract capital and new expertise, but also improve services, and introduce new products and ideas. In order to establish firm motivation among our clients, we are considering a model of medical insurance—that is, medical services for the insured so as to get people interested in their own healthcare, not just for treatment, but also more importantly, for prevention.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-place-to-see]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How closely does Kazakhstan Tourist Association (KTA) work with the government?<br></h4><p>Tourism is more than just a business. The participation of the government is essential. Of course, we work closely with the government. We are members of all the working groups that address questions related to tourism, and every committee connected to the tourism industry, as part of the Ministry of Industry and New Technology and with the Ministry of Education. We monitor developments in this sector closely in order to determine which are the most relevant trends in the labor market and which problems are the most urgent. Right now, one of the major issues for our members is personnel. We are working with the Ministry of Transport and Communications on this, because one of the most important elements of the sector is transport and logistics. We also work with regional councils as Kazakhstan is an enormous country, and if each region does not have its own local cluster for developing touristic resources and services, it is very difficult to imagine how our committees can operate. We occasionally disagree with the government, and sometimes we find ourselves on opposite sides of an issue, but we more frequently feel deeply satisfied with the partnership.</p><h4>What opportunities are there for foreign investors in the tourism sector in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>There are many plans in the works right now, both for construction and in the opening of hotels, such as the Rixos and Radisson. Entrepreneurs in Kazakhstan are inviting major foreign chains to come here. It indicates that the hotel market here is attractive to investors. The second area of interest to investors is also related to hotels, and there are possibilities for various types of complexes. There is a serious discussion underway about developing tourist clusters of a certain level, and developing facilities in places like Borovoye. There are many plans to construct similar resorts in Almaty Province, and others on the Caspian Sea. Yet, another major opportunity for investors would be in training establishments, because today, unfortunately, we cannot say that we have the resources to develop a professional cadre.</p><h4>What trends have you noticed in the tourism sector?</h4><p>Since 2010, we have noticed an increase in the number of citizens travelling within Kazakhstan. These are not vacations, either, they are tours taken on days off. The people of Kazakhstan are beginning to take more of an interest in their own health and in recreation. On their days off, they go to relax someplace outside their city's borders. This sector of internal tourism has been developing well. The numbers for international tourism are not bad either, with over 5 million visitors. The bad news is that of the 5 million, few of these are actual tourists; the majority are business travellers. According to information collected by tourism organizations, business visitors who come to the country for meetings or work purposes are also counted as tourists.</p><h4>How can the government assist the private sector in developing the tourism industry?</h4><p>We don't have to reinvent the wheel—there are other countries that have a great deal of experience in successfully developing the sector, and it occupies a respectable place in the country. It is clear that we can't do anything without the government. We need the government in two ways: first, to assist businesses by developing the country's infrastructure, such as the road system, installation of electric and water systems, and communications infrastructure. Establishing a foundation for the market is a priority for a developing tourism sector. Currently, there are not many incentives available for businesses in Kazakhstan; we have to buy everything ourselves. We would like to see more preferences for the purchase of land for building infrastructure, for tax corridors, debt funds, and discounted rates—this is what we expect in the way of assistance from the government.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the unique challenges businesses face in Kazakhstan?<br></h4><p>In terms of tax codes, the scenario is relatively ambiguous and open to interpretation, allowing for judgments to be made quite often against the best interest of the taxpayer. Thus, problems with the tax authorities can arise. Yet, in the seven years that I have been here, there has been a certain improvement. An organization has been set up to deal with related complaints. I am the Chairman of the European Business Association, for example, and we had a tax issue. We involved the investment ombudsman to resolve the issue and the system worked. In any country, the tax authorities have an agenda of raising tax revenue. When the crisis occurred, the tax authorities in the UK and the US became more aggressive in chasing tax avoidance. For example, the US is trying to collect taxes from people all around the world, not just in the US. There are moves by tax authorities around the world to become more aggressive against tax avoidance. Kazakhstan is no exception in this sense; however, people are more nervous about the tax authorities here because of the environment of ambiguity.</p><h4>How is the private sector and government working together to address these ambiguities in the tax code?</h4><p>There are regular sessions. I work in banking and there have been many tax issues surrounding the provisioning of loans, with working groups set up between the Ministry of Finance tax authorities and the Financier's Association that represents all banks. There is a dialogue, but it still largely depends on which sector you are talking about.</p><h4>What advantages do limited liability partnerships offer companies over other types of business entity in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>The regulation regarding limited liability is more restricted in scope than that of a joint-stock company. There are four types of business entity that can be set up: individual entrepreneurs or sole trader type businesses, branch or representative offices, limited partnership (LP), and joint-stock companies. Joint-stock companies have set requirements, such as being audited, filing financial statements, and certain thresholds for capital injections. For an LP, the capital injections are much lower and reporting does not exist; therefore, the ease of doing business with an LP is far greater. What normally happens is that companies that enter Kazakhstan do so as a branch or representative office to try and drum up business; however, once they have Kazakh-generated activity, it has implications that attract tax authority attention. Then, what branch offices or representatives tend to do is switch to an LP since this is required as a business. The LP offers an easy means of enjoying a legitimate business structure in Kazakhstan without all the additional requirements of a joint-stock venture.</p><h4>What are some of the challenges that the Customs Union represents?</h4><p>The Customs Union, in my view, has been more beneficial for Russia than for Kazakhstan. That is probably a controversial view since this is a CIS market, but it has allowed Russian goods to come into Kazakhstan with benefits, or without imposed duty. With the volume of production that can be achieved in Russia, it is far easier for Russian goods to enter Kazakhstan than it is for Kazakhstani goods to go to Russia because the production facilities do not exist. The infrastructure is far less developed here in terms of the manufacturing sector. This has created challenges on the Kazakhstani side. In terms of business, it has probably reduced it to the extent that transfers from Russia to Kazakhstan are no longer customs-exempt; however, people bringing goods into the Customs Union face more challenges and requirements; you must comply with Russian as well as Kazakhstani legislation.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the highlights and milestones for Efes in 2013?<br></h4><p>Overall, 2013 was an unusual year for the beer industry, and also for other beverages as well because we practically did not have a summer in Kazakhstan. The summer months represent our core business, and the overall industry was negatively affected by the bad weather conditions. We still did well in 2013 compared to the overall industry. Our estimations suggest that the industry will decline by around 5% in 2013 compared to 2012. We succeeded in remaining with the same volume as in 2012, which was slightly better than the industry average. However, there were also some positive changes; the market is becoming more structured and richer in terms of brands. In 2013, almost 30 new brands/products appeared on the market, some of which were ours, while others belonged to our competitors. This was a good development for beer culture in the country, as consumers are becoming more aware of different varieties, tastes, and qualities. There are benefits. The competition structure has also changed. A new player joined the game, which is also good because this is like a pool and whoever contributes to the pool will help the overall beer industry.</p><h4>Efes recently launched Zhigulevskoye unfiltered beer. What are some of the other recent and planned additions to the Efes range?</h4><p>At the beginning of 2013, we integrated our operations with those of SAB Miller in Kazakhstan. This integration was completed at an earlier stage in Russia and Ukraine. It allowed us to start operating with SAB Miller's portfolio in Kazakhstan, which is very rich and contains five important brands and many stock-keeping units (SKUs). Now, our portfolio is much richer. We have 13 brands in total and 64 SKUs—quite a large variety. We launched Zhigulevskoye in the second half of 2012 and it became a success story very quickly. There is an overall trend toward Zhigulevskoye because there is no player in the market that does not have a Zhigulevskoye brand today, which is almost the same for Russia. We can talk about it as if it is its own segment. Unlike other players, our Zhigulevskoye Razlivnoe is upper mainstream, not lower mainstream. First, we launched the lager type, and then we introduced the mild version, which is easier to drink. In summer 2013, we launched an unfiltered version, which was a first for the market. It is unfiltered with a different production style. When the bottle stays still it looks transparent, until you shake it. Consumers get the real taste when they shake the bottle as they pour the beer into a glass. This is a totally new product for Kazakhstan. Recently, we launched Kruzhka Svezhego Mild in a 250 ml bottle. It is unique with the slogan “immediate refreshment," because you can consume it whenever and wherever you want since it is just several sips. Our goal is to create new consumption occasions, to move away from the idea that beer should be drunk in a specific location. This is a new category. At first, we were expecting mostly younger consumers to be interested in this product; however, overall demand is surprisingly quite wide. It has only been on the market for a short time, but has given us some very promising results already.</p><h4>What were the best-selling beers in 2013?</h4><p>Bely Medved is still the top selling beer in our portfolio; it represents almost 20% of the Kazakhstani market, followed by Kruzhka Svezhego, another one of our strong brands. It is the second largest brand in the market. Then comes Karagandinskoe, our local brand from Karaganda. Zhigulevskoye's performance is also quite high. We have already reached almost a 5% market share with Zhigulevskoye in just one year, which is a fantastic result.</p><h4>What trends have you noticed in the alcoholic beverages market?</h4><p>One trend we have noticed is upsizing. Consumers are paying more attention to larger package sizes. We have launched two brands in a one-liter bottle, Karaganda and Zhigulevskoye, with successful results. The format is  convenient and has sharing possibilities. That gives an advantage, especially for home consumption. We have also launched a smaller bottle, which serves more immediate consumption needs. Mild beer, alcohol-wise, is also becoming much more popular. It now represents more than 10% of the market.</p><h4>Efes is active in regard to corporate social responsibility (CSR). How is the company working toward this goal?</h4><p>Over 2013, we have started many projects that I am proud of. Saving the golden eagles was a highlight, and we continue to work toward this goal. We are collaborating with a state organization protecting eagles in Kazakhstan because it is considered the national symbol of the country. Another thing that made us very proud is receiving the Golden Heart Award, which is given to people or organizations that make significant investments in charity or show great social responsibility. Also, we are now very much focused on responsible consumption, and we have launched several projects in this regard. We have organized a team informing sales points about underage sales in Kazakhstan (under 21 years). We are voluntarily informing our clients to respect the regulations. Secondly, in 2013 we started an excellent project by signing agreements with some Horeca outlets to provide sober drivers for Efes drinkers. If you went out drinking and have a car, Efes Kazakhstan pays for a driver; it is a service that is appreciated. We also have distributed small devices with which you can check your own alcohol level. It shows if you are already over the drunk driving limit. In some outlets, we have installed larger, more sophisticated devices so you can check the alcohol rate yourself. In Karaganda, we have started social numerous projects with the local administration. There was a so-called “Babushka Pazaar," where elderly women sold homegrown vegetables on the streets. Together with the city administration we have created a covered bazaar with stands so they have a place to sit and are protected from the rain and sun. We will continue such projects also in the future.</p><h4>The government has noted that it intends to increase the excise tax on alcohol, initially regarding hard liquor, with low alcohol products to be considered in 2014. What is your view of this move and of government regulation of the market in general?</h4><p>At the moment, we know that the tax on beer will not increase in 2014. The taxation on alcohol should not be made on the volume of product, but on its alcohol content. That is our argument, and we keep defending it. It seems that the government thinks and acts in line with this global trend. We know that taxes will increase for products with  alcohol content of above 30%, and it will create a better consumer choice in the end.</p><h4>Efes' goal is to double business by 2020. What strategies will the company employ to achieve this goal?</h4><p>We are still keen on achieving that goal, and are ahead of our targets. We believe that it may happen even earlier than 2020. Besides doubling our business, which was the vision in 2010, we also added another ambition: to be the most admired FMCG company in Kazakhstan. That encompasses everything from being an ideal employer to being a trustworthy partner to distributors and consumers. In all of this, we have project groups working on how we can improve our skills, and that obviously has a lot to do with the people of Efes. We have clear investments for training management and attracting new staff, while still engaging with existing employees.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are Samruk-Kazyna's greatest achievements?<br></h4><p>The Real Estate Fund Samruk-Kazyna was founded in 2009 to resolve the problem of a multiple number of shareholders who had been deceived by private construction companies. Kazakhstan is the only country that adopted the program for assisting people who suffered economic depression in the construction market. The President set a challenge to resolve the problem and, in particular, complete housing construction for the deceived shareholders. During the recent global financial crisis, over 100 housing developers were acknowledged to have gone bankrupt. Adjudication bankruptcy was the easiest way to leave the shareholders facing their problems on their own. Kazakhstan set about resolving the problems left in the construction sector by using other methods. Our investments allowed for the completion of 1 million sqm of high-quality dwellings, and that mitigated problems for over 3,000 shareholders. It is one of our most prominent achievements. Investments were performed through the buying out of free apartments from the troubled developers. The Real Estate Fund Samruk-Kazyna was the only organization in Kazakhstan that sold the bought out apartments by installments, which allowed for a secured return of the formerly invested money. The apartment owners have been paying monthly rent for 13 years, which is convenient for young families and buyers with moderate means. It is difficult to get a mortgage in a period of economic recession. At present, there are 800 families living in apartments acquired with the help of the installment program. It is worth mentioning that within the last three years, there were no violations of payment terms by tenants. In connection with finalizing the Anti-Crisis Program, in 2012 the Real Estate Fund started the Affordable Housing-2020 Program. Under the Program, we offer economy class dwelling. The prime cost of 1 sqm does not exceed $800-$1,000, and the selling cost cannot exceed $1,000-$1,200. In order to reduce costs we are trying to optimize the use of future dwelling spaces. For example, a typical two-room apartment for a young family will be a 35-40 sqm studio. We also apply energy saving and energy efficient technologies where possible. The program is in partnership with private developers. Our partners submit projects meeting all the requirements and invest at least 20% of the total cost of construction. The Fund adds the rest of the finances. Once construction is complete, the housing is transferred to the company-partner and the Fund for their disposal pro rata to their investments. Samruk-Kazyna sells its share through the Affordable Housing-2020 Program. As of today, private developers have submitted to the Real Estate Fund their applications for the joint realization of housing construction projects of about 5 million sqm in total area.</p><h4>Considering the forthcoming World Expo 2017, what do you expect for the real estate sector in the future?</h4><p>The World Expo 2017 and Affordable Housing-2020 will have a great influence upon the real estate and construction sectors. Kazakhstan has overcome the crisis, and construction works are continuing throughout the country. Economic-class real estate is one of the main priorities in Kazakhstan. There are enterprises under construction in order to reduce expenses for capital-intensive materials, such as glass, elevators, and pipes. The World Expo 2017 will facilitate the development of green engineering and illustrate some ecologic, economic, and social advantages due to the transfer of energy efficient housing corresponding to European standards. The exhibition will be staged on an area of 100 hectares. In our area, we are going to construct what we call “Green Town," and in 2013 we arranged the tender for its design. It was an international tender, and many companies from the UK, Portugal, and Monaco participated. We decided to cooperate with the UK firm AEDAS, because it proposed the best project in accordance with international ecological methods of assessment.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has V-Time Object Office developed since it was founded?<br></h4><p>We began operations in 2007 as a sales office of Bene AG. At that time, construction was booming in Kazakhstan. Bene AG, a celebrated worldwide producer of office interiors, looked at the Kazakhstani market and decided that an office should be opened on the ground. I was working for the Baker &amp; McKenzie law firm at the time, and became a Bene client. I was highly impressed with Bene's products when I saw the catalogues, visited the factory, and perused the showroom in Vienna. I realized that the firm had a completely different attitude to office space, the likes of which I hadn't seen before. It was for that reason that I took the decision to accept Bene's job offer and start the Bene business in Kazakhstan. I never was a sales professional, and there were three of us when we got the ball rolling in 2007. We really got going in 2008, during the crisis. We didn't have any experience in the field, or even a showroom, and sold solely on the strength of our emotions and the high level of excitement about Bene products. We were also selling some of the most expensive products on the market. Despite these challenges, we doubled our turnover each year and eventually opened up a showroom in the center of Almaty in 2012. In 2013, we were involved in some large-scale projects, including the new Kaspi Bank office building. Not everyone would undertake such complicated project work. At the beginning of 2013, due to Bene's organizational changes, we were faced with the choice of becoming an independent dealer, and we accepted this new challenge on February 1, 2013.</p><h4>What are your key products and services?</h4><p>We offer a complete package of products and services for office interiors, and our performance in 2013 confirms that we are on the right track. Our mission is to bring to Kazakhstan an understanding that an office is a motivational tool, and that smart solutions for an office space can improve business processes, save money, and create a positive emotional atmosphere in the office. We work with our clients on a complete turnkey basis. We begin by getting an idea of the client's business processes. Following this, we choose from among thousands of technical options that Bene offers. Then, together with the client, we create a unique design, which underlines the client's corporate style and culture. We work hard from beginning until the end, designing proper layouts, producing the furniture, and then overseeing delivery and installation. Clients appreciate the process because we offer them exactly what they need. Over the past year, we have also noticed a growing number of SMEs approaching us. They no longer consider the cost in the same way, but appreciate the value that our products can bring to their businesses.</p><h4>How are attitudes to office space changing in a practical sense?</h4><p>In the past, little consideration was given to the practical aspects of an office. Today, however, space is highly considered. Offices require a range of areas that support different activities. In one area, for example, you may concentrate on work, whereas in another people need to be able to communicate. A third area can then be dedicated to client presentations. In short, it is important to appreciate the office as a unified organism.</p><h4>What are the strengths and challenges of working in the Kazakhstani market?</h4><p>The main challenge is to change minds. Our clients come to us with ideas, and leave with completely new fresh ones. We are also working to educate the sector, as clients do not always fully grasp their requirements.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How important is the partnership with ADM Capital for your future strategy?<br></h4><p>For us, ADM Capital is key to our future growth plans as our joint venture allows us to invest where we previous might not have been able to due to the availability of funds. We believe that working with ADM Capital allows us to develop our assets and future strategic infrastructure projects that will improve the value of our portfolio. In terms of our future, I think it is a continuous partnership built for the long term. We are operators and they are money managers, which means that there is a beneficial synergy at work here.</p><h4>What is your real estate market focus in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>To date, the vast majority of our investment has been in Atyrau as a large part of our revenues is generated by our assets there. Recently, we have been focused on improving the quality of our assets and the lives of our guests and tenants in Atyrau, and by doing so the lives of people living there in general. With our current development plans for quality apartments, leisure, and recreational facilities, I think we will more than accomplish our goals there. In Aktau, our business today is not significantly related to the oil and gas business. We do, however, believe that Aktau will experience significant growth once the offshore oil industry begins to expand, and those properly invested locally will reap the benefits of that investment. We have a significant land bank that is centrally located, and a well thought out development plan that should allow us to realize our potential there.</p><h4>Has there been growth and development in all of the cities you work in?</h4><p>Our business in Aksai has been slow for the past three years as a result of the difficulties at Karachaganak. Hopefully, this situation will improve as the future investment plan there comes together. Bautino is a small market with one large client, which we have a long, successful working history with. I really do not see that market expanding until such time as the Kashagan offshore project enters its next expansion phase, and that could be a few years yet. In Aktau, our business has improved despite the slowdown in offshore oil projects that were supposed to fuel growth there. I think that in time that will change, but again much depends on the offshore component. We have never really attacked Almaty as a market as the city seems to focus mostly on five-star luxury hotels, and that is not a business that Chagala excels at. Yet, we are always looking for viable hotel and office space projects here, so in time that situation may change.</p><h4>What movements do you foresee in the real estate sector over the next five years?</h4><p>It all depends on what happens with the financing banks—Halyk, BTA, ATF, Kazcommertsbank, and so on. Once this becomes clear, the market will become clear as well. At the moment, Almaty and Astana are booming. In addition, Aktau is a hugely underserved market; I don't know why people don't invest more there. People are clamoring for good housing, but it seems that nobody wants to provide it. The demographics are stable, rendering it a good a place to invest. If you sell a quality product then you should reap the benefits. In Aksai, it all depends on what happens with Karachaganak, but based on history and the current situation I could see the situation not improving for another decade. Nobody really knows for sure, and I hope that I am wrong.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>Which of LG's products have been most successful in 2013?<br></h4><p>Given income levels and the general economic climate, people have generally lacked the disposable income to make numerous purchases of consumer appliances. Nevertheless, the television market—making up almost half of our business—in 1H2013 showed some signs of growth, rising 20% compared to the previous year. The home appliance market, meanwhile, performed slightly better than in 2012, while the mobile phone market also performed well on close to 30% growth.</p><h4>To what degree has your market share increased?</h4><p>Our market share is at about 40% in Kazakhstan, and has grown by roughly 3% when compared to 2012.</p><h4>Where is your focus in the TV market?</h4><p>The focus is on the premium segment, meaning Ultra HDTVs, which give perfect picture quality, but have a high price. However, we are working to customize these devices and within a year or so the price will be reduced. Until that time, we are focusing on Ultra HDTVs with a cost of 60% to 70% of OLED TVs. The OLED TV is a hot issue all over the world, and we are number one in that segment, with around a 3% market share.</p><h4>LG recently released the LG Flex, the world's first curved mobile phone. What are the benefits of the LG Flex for customers?</h4><p>LG Flex is designed for the most effective reach from ear to mouth. An ingenious aspect of this phone is that the inside contains a battery, meaning that the entire device must be curved. This kind of battery is exclusively produced by LG. The final verdict, of course, always comes from the customer, and we are eagerly awaiting it.</p><h4>LG intends to build a new manufacturing plant in the Alatau SEZ. How important is Kazakhstan in LG's regional operations?</h4><p>LG is the only company with a manufacturing facility here in Kazakhstan. By having a local factory, we can produce more customized products for the local market. Electricity fluctuations in Kazakhstan are much higher than elsewhere. Therefore, if we develop a product highly tolerant to such fluctuations, we will be able to customize each product specifically for Kazakhstan. The second reason is that we will also be able to export to neighboring countries. In 2012, we received the Altyn Sapa prize for achievements in the field of product quality from the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan, Nursultan A. Nazarbayev; this is the second time that LG Electronics Almaty Kazakhstan (LGEAK) has received this award.</p><h4>LG's global sales for mobile devices continue to rise. How has this been reflected in local sales?</h4><p>LG was slightly late to the smartphone game, but it has invested significantly in engineering and technology, and our LG G2 devices have proven highly successful. We have another weapon too, which is the phone we have developed with Google—Nexus 5—which is very popular around the world. I expect a substantial increase in sales of the Nexus 5 and the G2 over 2014. Today, our product and technology is excellent and our customers are taking notice.</p><h4>What is your view of the ICT sector in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>I would say that the Kazakhstani market differs slightly from others. Consumers in  Kazakhstan have a greater technological perception than many other countries, and this explains the swift take-up of smartphones. In 2012, the smartphone market was between 40% and 50%, but today makes up almost 90% of the market. Customers are eager to grab the latest technology, and that is why our strategy is not to be focused on the lower end of the technological spectrum, but rather the high end by offering the latest products. Kazakhstan's swift adoption of the latest technology also encompasses Ultra HDTVs. I have spent eight years in India as well as some time in Egypt and the UAE, and I still conclude that Kazakhstan is highly promising for LG.</p><h4>What are your mid-term plans for growth and development in Kazakhstan and regionally?</h4><p>In 2014, we will change our strategy somewhat in terms of marketing and advertising; TV advertising has markedly decreased. People obtain much of their information from the internet now and have access to so much more of it. This is why we will focus more on web marketing to provide sufficient information to enable informed store shops, as internet purchases remain very low. Our aim is to pursue store design that enables customers to pinpoint relevant information as soon as they enter. Even though we have excellent displays today, the skills of our sales people are also of paramount importance, and we will be organizing structured training for our sales force.</p><p>Overall, I like Kazakhstan. Due to the wise management of the President and the work of the government the country has reached impressive results in a short historical period of time, and according to this parameter Kazakhstan and Korea are alike. My motherland also reached impressive results in a short time period and we have good perspectives on the nature of hard work, sense of purpose, creativeness, and patriotism of our nation and the political will of our President. I'm glad and feel responsible that in accordance with innovative technologies and the creation of new work places we can contribute to the prosperity of Kazakhstan—a successful, bright, and peaceful country—and contribute to the further growth of national welfare. This is a nation that can teach us many things. I would like to point out the role of the President of Kazakhstan, who puts every effort into creating an environment for broad economic growth, and who works to make conditions comfortable for investors. And I'm sure the goal set by Kazakhstan's President of becoming one of the 30 most developed industrial countries in the world will be ­accomplished earlier than has been planned.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been Coca-Cola's milestones over the past few years?<br></h4><p>We have been present in Kazakhstan for the past two decades, and in particular over the past five years have registered robust growth momentum. What's more, this has been the case despite a slight decline across several categories of the FMCG market. We are also working at close to full capacity, which will be our largest challenge over the coming years as the demand for Coca-Cola grows.</p><h4>Which of your products do especially well in the Kazakhstani market?</h4><p>All categories in the beverage sector are experiencing growth. Our flagship brand, Coca-Cola, is crucial for us of course, and is spearheading growth in this sector, which is a scenario we would like to maintain. We firmly believe that its success also helps to develop the other categories and brands.</p><h4>How do local tastes affect your marketing strategies?</h4><p>I perceive a change occurring in consumer habits and preferences. Hot tea is very important in terms of beverage consumption, and surveys show that it is still considered part of a meal in Kazakhstani culture. This is a challenge for us as we would like to see Coca-Cola viewed in the same light. In that respect, our long-term strategy is to continuously work on the “Coke &amp; Meal" concept and provide more choice for our consumers at the dinner table. We are also working in other categories, such as the social consumption of Coca-Cola. Even TV viewing is an important occasion for us, for which we also have strategies in place. However, hot tea remains the greatest challenge to overcome. During the crisis of 2009, the consumption of local lemonades grew, but that trend has reversed over the past three years, with Coca-Cola having replaced those products as the sector's growth engine.</p><div class="quote">“  Our plant in Almaty is one of the most state-of-the-art beverage plants in the world, able to simultaneously produce almost any kind of packaging. "</div><h4>How has the growth of a fast food culture impacted sales?</h4><p>When out and about, it is common to see new restaurants and fast food eateries. However, while their quality is increasing, there is no real change in terms of the number of restaurants. As old, traditional restaurants are replaced by more modern venues, quality is certainly improving, but this is marked by slow growth. The development of the fast food sector occurs in parallel with the opening of new shopping malls. In 2014, two large shopping malls are set to open in Almaty. Yet, while this is a welcome development, we would like to see more occur.</p><h4>What prompted the planned development of a new plant in Astana?</h4><p>Our plant in Almaty is one of the most state-of-the-art beverage plants in the world, able to simultaneously produce almost any kind of packaging. There are larger, more advanced plants, but those generally have a specific focus. Here, we have an all-in-one model and are able to produce everything from glass bottles to cans, cartons, PET packages, and much more. The process is limited, however, by aspects such as land, energy, and logistics, with the latter being highly dependent on rail links. This is essentially why we decided to develop an alternative supply point. Given Kazakhstan's geographical conditions, Astana seemed like the best place to locate a new production facility. Accordingly, we have purchased the land and are beginning to develop the details of the project.</p><h4>What is the scale of the project?</h4><p>It is certainly set to be a large investment, and will be executed incrementally. It will have two lines to begin with, and by 2020 will have become a mega plant. Eventually, it will be around the same size as our Almaty plant.</p><h4>How do you perceive the investment climate in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>We believe that our business will continue to grow as the Kazakhstani economy becomes more wealthy and prosperous. Coca-Cola Almaty Bottlers is one of the first FMCG companies to invest in Kazakhstan. We believe in the prosperous future of Kazakhstan. Innovation and creativity are developing quickly here, and so government support for the investment climate should be on par. In terms of the economy, this is a promising address for investors, and I have noticed that there have been many enquiries from foreign firms looking to invest. The investment climate is also affected by the global economy, and as it begins to recover Kazakhstan's development will accelerate.</p><h4>This is becoming an important region for Coca-Cola, which is investing $50 million in Uzbekistan in 2014. What are the company's overall plans for expansion in Central Asia?</h4><p>Uzbekistan is not in our area of responsibility, but we are a part of a larger group that has activities in Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan in Central Asia. Central Asia has strong momentum and offers higher growth compared to other parts of the world. Our flagship is Kazakhstan, however, which is the most promising economy in the region.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the medium term in terms of Coca-Cola and the industry as a whole?</h4><p>Even though we see a slowdown, especially in the second half of 2014, we believe momentum will grow. Astana's World Expo 2017 will also bring good momentum to the economy at large. I do not see any large risks for the medium term that will prevent the development of the country under the Strategic Plan 2030. Considering the rest of the world, it is logical to invest in this region. As a company, we believe in Kazakhstan, and that is why we continue to invest here.</p><h4>How do you perceive the differences between Turkey and Kazakhstan?</h4><p>There are no large differences. Turkey's beverage sector is a little more developed, with a higher per-capita consumption rate, although alcohol consumption is higher in this region.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you talk about Prima Group's main achievements in Kazakhstan since it was established?<br></h4><p>The challenges that the company has faced in 2013 are similar to those that we would face in any other year. The quality of the transport infrastructure is not satisfactory, and there are many factors that have contributed to this, such as low population density, long distances between cities, poor road quality, and a lack of vehicles. On top of that, there are a limited amount of storage solutions in Kazakhstan. There are only a few class-A warehouses, and they are mainly located in Almaty, Astana, or Aktyubinsk. Most of Kazakhstan's warehouses fail to comply with international standards as they were inherited from the Soviet Union and have only been slightly renovated. It is not an exaggeration to say that all the market players at some point have experienced the same problems as Prima Distribution. The national economy is developing rapidly, and the infrastructure can't keep up. Also, there is something of an issue with logistics and distribution professionals. Given Kazakhstan's vast territory and low population density, it is now necessary, in my opinion, to improve the personnel. There are around 4,000 employees working for Prima Distribution. Sadly, new entrants to the profession are lacking experience, and hence do not have the necessary skill set to compete in this market. To ensure high-quality service, Prima Distribution has set up its own training centers.</p><h4>What has been the growth strategy of Prima Group to become what it is now?</h4><p>What greatly contributes to the company's success is the level of the top management's commitment to ongoing business processes. Shareholders are also actively involved in corporate decision-making. We have worked hard to earn a reputation as a reliable business partner; therefore, working with Prima Distribution is challenging, but can establish you as a good name. The same applies to our employees—it is easy for people to find a job after they have worked with Prima Distribution. Our personnel's well-being is of paramount importance to the company; hence, some of our key employees have been working with us for over a decade. We are investing in the development of our strategic planning department, as the times when one could rake in the money have passed. Prima Distribution consistently follows standards of transparency, and we feel compelled to fulfill our obligations under the agreements, whether they be written or verbal. Our code of ethics makes the company attractive to both potential partners and banks.</p><h4>How would you describe the market currently in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>In my opinion, the FMCG and consumer packaged goods (CPG) market is rather steady. To put it mildly, people don't eat less regardless of the state of the economy. Most of the FMCG companies that we work with show constant annual growth up to 10%. Of course, growth rates tend to slow down as the market becomes saturated, but at the same time, consumers are becoming more selective. It allows us to develop a niche market for quality goods. Kazakhstan is a post-Soviet country; therefore, consumer culture is in a way restricted. If we compare gross consumer spending in Kazakhstan or Russia with that of Europe, the numbers differ significantly. On the other hand, it is a great source of growth, owing to the fact that there are more and more people who travel today and experience different lifestyles.</p><h4>How do you maintain these strong relationships with your international partners?</h4><p>Our fundamental business principle is being transparent and honest with our partners. Prima Distribution is a predictable and reliable partner. If a problem arises, we talk it through and always try to resolve it. As a result, we have associates that have been working with Prima Group for over a decade. Many of our partners do not insist on bank support, which allows for lower business costs.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Which logistical services is Cruz focusing on?<br></h4><p>Our company is investigating the heavy lifting sector. We realize some container and air shipments revolve around the project sector. If there is a project and we are moving heavy equipment that requires spare parts, we can do that; however, we are not a company that would move containers as our major operation. We work on turnkey projects, and have people who are qualified, trained, and certified for this type of work. We have a projects department that has engineers who sit with clients to provide the know-how needed. We tell them what the restrictions and limitations are for transportation in this country. We also inform them of the customs requirements, regulations, and tax laws that are enforced when we provide tailor-made products for certain solutions in Kazakhstan.</p><h4>How would you assess Kazakhstan's operating environment for international companies?</h4><p>What keeps us happy in this country is that the attitude toward finding quality players is slowly changing. You could sell anything to Kazakhstan in the 1990s; however, today things have changed. People are much more quality conscious now, and they understand that it is not the cheapest or even the most expensive that is the best; there is a balance for quality. That is what we see as the prospective of growth of this country. We see many foreign countries that are keen to enter Kazakhstan, but lack the know-how. It is a risky venture to invest here at this stage unless you hire professionals. There are a few recruiting agencies that I know well, and they are struggling to find quality workers because there is a tendency to jump from one company to another for better pay. I would in fact say that is not a stable job market from the point of view of an employer. We have many young people graduating from universities who have absolutely no practical knowledge. They come back from the London School of Management or Harvard and try to implement these ideas in Kazakhstan. And while I approve of those ideas in themselves, they are simply not realistic today, and this country requires more customized solutions.</p><h4>From which sectors do you see the most demand for logistics services emerging?</h4><p>Construction is one. Cruz Logistics works with BASF to bring in all of its (hazardous and non-hazardous) construction chemicals and goods. We have special agreements with Lufthansa, KLM, and Turkish Airlines. Industrial construction is more concentrated in the West of Kazakhstan, while the infrastructure construction right now is in Almaty, Astana, and the domestic market. As far as the oil and gas and mining markets go, it is very active and receiving considerable investment. There is a consequent rise in employment opportunities, which gives rise to consumer power. So, naturally there are many food and beverages and consumables being brought here.</p><h4>Why did Cruz Logistics select Kazakhstan as its base of operations?</h4><p>I think it is one of the fastest growing economies in the world as of today. China is growing quickly, but has sufficient manpower and resources to support it. China is a different story; it is not a standard proposition. However, the CIS countries, Africa, and South America are the three major places where one wants to invest today. Africa poses a risk, which leaves South America and the CIS. Within the latter, I would put my money on Kazakhstan, not because I have been here for 20 years, but because if you compare Kazakhstan to its neighbors, such as Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and even Azerbaijan, which is a fast growing economy, I think this country has a more stable political environment and is growing. We have seen the tidal waves of the global crisis hit. These have hit Kazakhstan, I would say, more in the real estate market, but as far as financial structures and industries are concerned, this country still has its feet planted firmly on the ground.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>Does the Kazakhstan Space Agency (Kazcosmos) seek to create a robust space industry in Kazakhstan, and how will Kazcosmos achieve this goal?<br></h4><p>Kazcosmos was established a relatively short time ago, in March 2007, by a Decree of the President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev. Compared to the US, Russia, and China, which have been working on their space programs for at least 50-60 years, we have had a limited time to set up fully fledged, space-technology infrastructure. Therefore, Kazcosmos made use of its international partners and their extensive global experience. As a result of cooperation with foreign countries and some of the world's most established organizations, such as Airbus Defense and Space and SSTL, Kazakhstan has an almost fully developed space industry at its disposal. The realization of this scheme in Kazakhstan was carried out by the creation of the National Space Center (NSC) in Astana—a high-tech complex for the provision of favorable conditions for the establishment of a space industry in Kazakhstan that is competitive in the international market. The NSC occupies an area of 30 hectares and is located in a free economic zone called Astana-New City. In order to create NSC's manufacturing sites, work is currently underway on the practical realization of the projects on the creation of assembly, integration, and testing complex of spacecraft, earth remote sensing space system (ERS SS), and high-accuracy satellite navigation system for Kazakhstan. Therefore, the creation of an ERS SS project, which will provide services in satellite images, is being established by Kazcosmos together with our strategic partner Airbus Defence and Space. As a result of the realization of the project, two ERS SS (high and medium resolutions), a ground dedicated complex, and a ground control complex for the ERS SS will be created.</p><p>Today, the assembly and testing of ERS SS with high and medium resolutions have been completed and the ground complexes are prepared. Work on the organization of ERS SS launches is being carried out, with a scheduled completion date of 2Q2014. In addition, Kazcosmos is taking measures to provide training to its own staff. Over the last two-and-a-half years of developing Kazakhstan's ERS SS, we have trained specialists in the UK and France, and as a result a group of local engineers and operators have been trained. An assembly, integration, and testing complex of spacecraft (AITCS) is being created together with our French partner Airbus Defence and Space. As a result of the project, a high-tech enterprise for the design, assembly, and testing of spacecraft components of the payload and elements of space techniques will be created. Besides industrial building, AITCS in its composition will include a Special Design and Technology Bureau (SDTB) for space technologies, laboratories, and production sites to manufacture certain spacecraft components. Currently in the framework of this project, the design and manufacture stages of technological equipment for all test facilities have been completed, with the delivery of parts and technological equipment details underway. AITCS buildings and the SDTB of space technologies has launched pilot production. The term of commissioning these objects is planned for 2015. We have also started the implementation of another important project, which is the creation of ground infrastructure and a high-accuracy satellite navigation system for Kazakhstan. The realization of this project will provide guaranteed quality of coordinate time and navigation services for the users of global navigation satellite systems on the territory of the Republic of Kazakhstan. Currently, a sea-based differential station has been created and put into permanent commission. A differential correction and monitoring center was put into operation, and its pilot production was conducted. Some 50 prototypes of differential stations of local production were manufactured, which are now located on the territory of Kazakhstan.</p><p>Taking into account the vast territory of Kazakhstan, the establishment of the national system of satellite communication and broadcasting satellite, KazSat, is another strategically important project, as it will effectively solve the problems of communication and broadcasting over the whole territory of the country and meet the needs of Kazakhstan's market for television broadcasting, fixed communications, internet, and data transmission. Entering service in November 2011, the KazSat-2 satellite is operating in a normal mode. Moreover, we actively worked on KazSat-3. Its capacity significantly exceeds that of KazSat-2, and it was launched in April 2014. The KazSat communication and broadcasting satellite system project is directed not only to the development of the orbital constellation of spacecraft, but also for the development of the ground segment. Thus, the control of KazSat-2 is provided by Kazakhstani specialists. In 2005, in the town of Akkol in the Akmola region, a modern ground-based complex for controlling satellites, was established and is currently successfully operating and servicing our space efforts. In June 2013, in the Iliy district of the Almaty region, a new back-up, ground-based complex for controlling satellites was introduced. We have large-scale plans, and in 2014 we aim to provide telecommunications services to other CIS countries, including Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Russia. As is well known, the space industry cannot be competitive or develop without having a serious scientific and technological base.</p><h4>You have often expressed your opinion in favor of Russian participation in the Baikonur Cosmodrome. How do you foresee this partnership in the future?</h4><p>Cooperation with the Russian Federation in the field of space has an important meaning for the Republic of Kazakhstan, and represents great opportunities for the development of its own space industry, as far as the Russian Federation is the main strategic partner of Kazakhstan. The Baikonur Cosmodrome is Kazakhstan's unique opportunity to attend manufacturing works with the accumulation of experience in the area of training, maintenance, and launches of spacecraft. This feature is currently implemented through joint Kazakhstani-Russian work on the project of making Baikonur an ecologically friendly space rocket complex. The presidents of Kazakhstan and Russia, having signed (on January 9, 2004) the interstate agreement on cooperation for the effective use of the Baikonur complex, extended the term of the complex lease up to 2050 and agreed that the environmental problems of the cosmodrome will be solved through the establishment of new environmentally safe space systems (in particular, the Baiterek complex) and the phased reduction of launches of rockets using highly toxic fuels, such as heptyl and amyl. In accordance with the interstate agreement in December 2004, the intergovernmental agreement on the creation of the Baikonur Cosmodrome and the Baiterek space rocket complex was concluded. The governments of Russia and Kazakhstan have now approved a joint plan of action on the realization of the project and the creation of the Baiterek complex on the basis of using the Zenith carrier-rocket. Under the new conditions, the Baikonur Cosmodrome may be a catalyst for the integration of CIS countries and bring Kazakhstan-Russia bilateral relations in the space sector to a qualitative new level. In general, I would like to note that the project enables Kazakhstan and Russia to create new relationships on the Baikonur complex and to build a new scheme of cooperation, implementing and solving state problems through the effective use of the facilities.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the priorities of the foreign affairs policy of Mexico regarding the Dominican Republic and the Caribbean region?<br></h4><p>One of the five strategic pillars of President Peña Nieto's administration is the positioning of Mexico as a relevant actor of global responsibility, while strengthening the country's position as a significant regional player and deepening the ongoing regional integration processes. Within this context is the expansion of dialogue and cooperation on disaster management, the environment, regional security, trade and investment, tourism, and cultural development with the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean. Mexico shares historical roots, geography, and culture with the Caribbean, and we aspire to higher levels of development and prosperity for our people, in addition to which there is a long tradition of solidarity and sympathy that has strengthened over time. As part of the diversification of the economic policies of Mexico, an important aspect of our relationship with the Caribbean is trade and Mexican investment in the Dominican Republic, which has become our largest trading partner in the region, as evidenced by the increase in bilateral trade over the past decade of 128% from $447.7 million to $1.014 billion, a period in which Dominican exports grew by 677%, while those of Mexico grew by 105%. Additionally, the Dominican Republic has become the fourth most important destination for Mexican investment in Latin America and the Caribbean, with an estimated $6.8 billion, becoming one of the leading investors in the Dominican Republic, contributing to the country's social and economic development with the creation of over 15,000 direct and 30,000 indirect jobs. Furthermore, we share a comprehensive program of technical-scientific and educational-cultural cooperation, particularly in the agricultural, SME, health, governance, socio-economic development, environment, and scholarship areas, among others. This exchange in terms of artistic and cultural exhibitions is also relevant and permanent.</p><h4>How can Mexico and the Dominican Republic benefit from each other's geostrategic location?</h4><p>The recent incorporation of the Dominican Republic as an observer of the Pacific Alliance provides an opportunity for this country to enter one of the most dynamic trading blocs today and benefit from greater cooperation in natural disaster programs, strengthening trade and business opportunities and supporting SMEs, among others. Mexico expects to begin negotiations with Dominican authorities aimed at reaching an agreement on Bilateral Free Trade and one for the Avoidance of Double Taxation, and to conclude the negotiation of the Agreement on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments in the near future, convinced that these tools provide greater certainty and attract even more Mexican investors who are keen to participate in the development of the Dominican Republic. Moreover, these tools could increase trade flows in both directions, particularly when you take into account that our country is an attractive market for over 115 million people speaking the same language. We currently have trade volumes with the world exceeding $750 billion, while commodities produced by Mexican industry would allow Dominican producers to be more competitive in markets to where they have traditionally exported.</p><h4>How can both countries benefit from deeper cooperation in agriculture?</h4><p>The experience Mexico has in these areas is shared with the Dominican Republic through specific cooperation projects in agriculture and promoting SMEs, which in turn contributes to the socio-economic development of the Dominican Republic. Mexico has supported and will continue to collaborate on diagnostic, crop improvement, and transfer of agricultural technology and biotechnology projects. However, it is considered appropriate to take the bilateral agricultural agreement to exploit the potential of the two economies and develop the potential of the Dominican agricultural sector. Mexico has thanked the Dominican government for the distinction of our country being chosen as First Guest of Honor at the First 2013 SME Week, in recognition of the Mexican strategy in this area and the 13-year history of SME weeks in our country. In effect, the Government of Mexico has shared its experience with Dominican SMEs in order to help them mature and become larger companies that can be integrated into the supply chains and become relevant exporters, contributing also to the creation of more job opportunities, as well as boosting the economic and overall national development. Cooperation activities between Mexico and the Dominican Republic have targeted, particularly in recent years, the competitive development of exporting companies and incubators, as well as programs for the employment of disabled people and practices to improve competitiveness.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the bilateral relations between the Dominican Republic and Trinidad and Tobago, and what is their scope?<br></h4><p>Relations between Trinidad and Tobago and the Dominican Republic have been cordial, with diplomatic relations officially established in May of 1968. Trinidad and Tobago has an Honorary Consul in the Dominican Republic in the person of Dr. Freddy Reyes. Among several high level meetings down the years, HE Danilo Medina, President of the Dominican Republic, met with the Honorable Kamla Persad-Bissessar Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago, on 27 May 2013, for the Multilateral Meeting between Heads of State and Government of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and of the Dominican Republic and the Vice President, where they engaged in discussions on matters related to, inter alia, regional security, trade, human and social development, and energy.</p><h4>The Dominican Republic recently received a trade mission from Trinidad and Tobago with 11 manufacturing and energy companies willing to expand their business operations in the country. What key investment opportunities does the Dominican Republic provide for Trinidad and Tobago?</h4><p>Trinidad and Tobago companies have undertaken cross-border investments in the Dominican Republic. Two such groups are Republic Bank and Prestige Holdings. In addition, the Royal Bank of Trinidad and Tobago (RBTT) has issued short-term funding to assist in purchasing equipment for hospitals and clinics. Trinidad and Tobago has a growing manufacturing sector, which includes food and beverages, electrical materials, construction materials, paper, and packaging products. Companies such as SM Jaleel, Angostura Ltd, TYE Manufacturing and Bermudez Biscuits Ltd are expanding globally, and the Dominican Republic can provide a market for their products. The energy sector is also a possible opportunity for investment in the Dominican Republic. Trinidad and Tobago currently exports liquefied natural gas, liquefied propane, liquefied butane, urea, and gas oil to the Dominican Republic and can explore further energy products to export.</p><h4>Trinidad and Tobago is a leading producer of oil and gas from which Dominican Republic imports account for $500 million per year. With the Dominican economy and demographics on the rise, how do you foresee the future of collaboration in this chapter?</h4><p>It has been previously indicated that the Dominican Republic spends a considerable amount annually importing oil and gas. Around 20% of national petroleum imports are provided by PETROCARIBE. And as demand for energy products continues to grow, Trinidad and Tobago is discussing with the Dominican Republic the question of the supply of natural gas or any other energy products it may require, to meet the rising demand.</p><h4>Dominican sugar molasses exports to Trinidad and Tobago accounted for $6 million in 2012, being the main product exported. What other areas in trade are important for both countries?</h4><p>Gravel, sand, cement clinkers, fertilizers, and canned soups are the other top imports from the Dominican Republic. Bananas are also imported from the Dominican Republic to Trinidad and Tobago. Energy products such as liquefied natural gas, liquefied propane, liquefied butane, urea, and gas oil are imported to the Dominican Republic from Trinidad and Tobago.</p><h4>The Dominican Republic has a strong tourism sector, while Trinidad and Tobago is looking to further diversify its economy and increase tourism. What are the opportunities being opened within this mutual cooperation?</h4><p>The Government of Trinidad and Tobago has targeted tourism as an area for development and expansion as a means of diversifying the economy away from oil and gas. Furthermore, the many beautiful beaches and waterfalls, biodiversity, and infrastructure make Trinidad and Tobago a potential hotspot for recreational tourism, event tourism, and ecotourism.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Which economic sectors hold the greatest potential for investment, and what about the Dominican Republic attracts foreign investors?<br></h4><p>Montás DomÍnguez The most attractive sectors for private investment have been ICT, mining, and tourism, which have experienced dynamic growth. These sectors will remain attractive to foreign investment in the near future. Meanwhile, the climate, its history, and its accessibility make the country one of the largest tourist attractions in the Caribbean region. Also, we have important open mineral deposits that make environmentally sustainable mining activity viable. The country also wants to attract foreign investment to its logistics and manufacturing industries to create higher value-added.</p><h4>What steps have been taken to maintain economic stability and foster economic growth?</h4><p>Macroeconomic stability is necessary to sustain achievements in welfare over time, and to encourage economic growth. Additionally, fundamental equilibrium in terms of the external, monetary, financial, and tax sectors must be ensured. And in order to maintain macroeconomic stability, the budget has featured a reduction of government spending and national debt, while a tax reform is raising revenues and keeping public finances on the right path. Meanwhile, the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic (CBDR) has adopted an inflation-targeting scheme that uses interest rates to signal the stance of monetary policy.</p><h4>What fiscal policy did the government pursue in 2013, and what is your prognosis for investment?</h4><p>During 2013, the government had to adopt a more restrictive fiscal policy, increasing taxes and reducing spending, which has impacted the decisions of private agents and economic activity. It is a period of adjustment that, once over, should see economic activity and investment returning to natural levels. Growth levels in 2013 reached 3%, following a slow 1Q2013, but there was much more dynamism in the third quarter. We are optimistic for both growth and investment over 2014. According to Deloitte's latest Business Barometer, 44.1% believe that the economic situation will have improved within around a year, whereas 35.5% believe that the business and investment environments will also improve.</p><div class="quote">“  Growth levels in 2013 reached 3%, following a slow 1Q2013, but there was much more dynamism in the third quarter. "</div><h4>What actions are being taken to promote greater specialization and modernization in the Dominican economy?</h4><p>The Ministry has assumed two major challenges to boost economic growth in the country and make this process a more inclusive one. Firstly, we developed the National Development Strategy 2030, which defines the country Dominicans want for 2030 and the policies to be implemented to achieve it. In this context, we consulted over 7,500 people and 1,425 civil society organizations, who all expressed their views on the country's image in 2030, including goals and policy guidelines. Secondly, we strengthened the National Planning and Public Investment System and implemented the National Development Strategy 2030. It was hard work that required training and coordination, and has already been reflected in three versions of the Multi-Year Plan for the Public Sector, which ensures the consistency of government investment guidelines to meet the goals of the National Development Strategy.</p><h4>You recently reviewed projects in the country funded by the World Bank worth $274 million. What will be the impact of these projects on the local economy?</h4><p>The relationship with the World Bank, as with other multilateral cooperation agencies, has been designed to support the country in its efforts to further develop its economy, financing projects in priority areas such as education, health, social care, energy, and governance, as well as supporting our budget and contributing to the country's fiscal and macroeconomic stability. We are in the process of defining the new strategy with the World Bank. The two sectors we plan to prioritize are education and electricity.</p><h4>SMEs are one of the main economic engines of the country, employing more than 850,000 people. What policies are in place to strengthen local SMEs and facilitate access to credit?</h4><p>Strategic programs to support SMEs are one of the main priorities of our government. In this context, we created the Vice-Ministry of SMEs within the Ministry of Industry and Trade, which is responsible for the formulation and implementation of programs to promote and support this sub-sector. Currently, there are some ongoing plans, programs, and projects to promote the sustainable development of SMEs and facilitate their formalization in terms of business activity. Regarding access to credit, we created a portfolio of public credit for SMEs in the CBDR of the Dominican Republic, which has Ps4 billion available for SMEs and an extra Ps600 million and Ps500 million through the Foundation for Microfinance Reserves and the National Council for Promotion and Support for Small and Medium Enterprises (PROMIPYME), respectively. Similarly, we created the Solidarity Bank with the objective of providing better access to quality financial services for low-income people, thereby facilitating the democratization of credit and the creation of social capital. We have also eased the regulatory requirements for the assessment and granting of credit to small borrowers through the adoption of the Rules of Microfinance. In addition, we amended the Regulation of the Law on Procurement and Public Contracting Procurement, aimed at simplifying the requirements for the State Register of Providers. This initiative has allowed the formal registration of a significant numbers of SMEs that supply the government. Furthermore, we implemented the virtual window platform at the national level and physical stop shop for the formalization of SMEs, providing a comprehensive registration service, expediting the process and revoking the mandatory legal assistance in drafting the bylaws of SMEs.</p><h4>What is the importance of new technologies for improving the management of the government and its relationship with citizens?</h4><p>Recently, we launched a new website, accessible from mobiles and other portable devices. The existence of open data requires availability and free access at any time, without restrictions in terms of using and distributing data. For this purpose, we have established guidelines to standardize access to information, and our commitment is to implement them as soon as possible. Open data encourages the active participation of citizens not only with suggestions and proposals, but also with the generation of citizen content such as photos and videos. These are tasks that the General Government Directorate of Ethics and Integrity, under Decree No. 486-12, follows up on in terms of implementation.</p><h4>The National Development Strategy is presented as a tool to advance the development and cohesion of society, expressing the vision of the country in 2030. What are the cornerstones of this strategy and how does it determine the policies implemented by the Ministry?</h4><p>Proposals for the National Development Strategy 2030 are articulated around four strategic pillars with institutional, social, economic, and environmental themes. In this context, we want to develop a social and democratic state in which institutions act ethically, transparently, and efficiently, ensuring safety and promoting equality, peaceful coexistence, and national and local development.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>It is important for the Dominican Republic to abandon boom and bust cycles and aim for stability. What evidence of stable growth have you witnessed over the past year?<br></h4><p>The remarkable performance in the Dominican Republic's economy and the competitive advantages of doing business here have provided increased flows of FDI into the productive sectors nationwide. Furthermore, foreign investment has been one of the main driving forces of the Dominican economy in recent years, due largely in part to the macroeconomic stability and the positive growth rates that have been sustained, transforming the country into one of the strongest economies in the Caribbean and one of the most important in the Latin American region. During 2012, the Dominican economy grew 3.9%, exceeding the regional average (3%) and the average growth of the world economy (3.1%), according to the IMF. Favorable export performance, which saw an increase of 5.4% compared to 2012, was also recorded. Thanks to legal assurance and economic stability, and the benefits of the country outlined in a strategy developed by our President, Danilo Medina, our country was recognized by the Financial Times for the year 2013/2014 as having the second best strategy in the Caribbean and Central America to attract foreign investment. Similarly, according to the Global Competitiveness Report 2013/2014, recently published by the WEF, the Dominican Republic is positioned in 11th place after evaluating 148 countries worldwide in terms of FDI and transfer of technology, which demonstrates the quality and impact on the local economy of investment flows into the country.</p><h4>What recent reforms has the government put in place to promote exports?</h4><p>In accordance with Law No. 488-08, which establishes the Regulatory Regime for the Development and Competitiveness of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MIPYMES), published on December 30, 2008, and strategic development guidelines from our President, Danilo Medina, the Dominican Republic is focused on promoting opportunities for small businesses, and small business development centers (SBDC), for their insertion into global markets, such as financing, integration, associative practices, and capacity building. Such businesses now represent 90% of our total economic structure and job generation. Specific efforts have been put into agribusinesses.</p><p>The creation of an Export-Import Bank in the Dominican Republic, a project that seeks to facilitate access to credit by providing financial inclusion and democratization of credit, is considered to be one of the priorities in terms of presidential goals. The promotion of exports and investments is coordinated by the CEI-RD and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In addition, a committee has been established to follow up on pesticide residue and other contaminants, which occur in agro-exports to the US and EU. As a result of this initiative, during the first trimester of 2013, the number of rejected containers was reduced by 33% in comparison to the same period of 2012.</p><div class="quote">“  Mining is also significant, and in the first decade of this century it has been one of the most attractive activities for the reception of foreign investment in the Dominican Republic. "</div><h4>How strategic are the completion and implementation of free trade agreements (FTAs) for the improvement of economic exchanges?</h4><p>Free trade presupposes a flow of imports and exports without restriction, and gaining market access or preserving existing preferences has remained a key motivation for signing FTAs. However, with the liberalization of trade around the world and the related diminishing size of preferential rents, the growing success of FTAs cannot be explained by the traditional market access motive alone. There is interest in a host of objectives, including importing higher policy standards, strengthening regional policy coordination, locking-in domestic reforms, and even addressing foreign policy issues.</p><h4>What is the potential for investment and trade in the region?</h4><p>The Dominican Republic has preferential access to more than 882 million consumers worldwide. Through our FTAs, we have negotiated favorable and flexible rules of origin, which offer a tremendous advantage for companies doing business in our country. We are one of only six countries in the world with FTAs and preferential market access to the US, through CAFTA-DR, and the EU, through EPA, with flexible rules of origin. The other five are Mexico, Chile, Morocco, Jordan, and Israel. The Dominican Republic offers a great diversity of business opportunities, where you can earn excellent returns on your investment and generate wealth and prosperity. One of these sectors is tourism. In the mid 1980s, the Dominican Republic began to go through a transformation in its productive structure that defined the process of outsourcing and services. From that moment, our country began to develop other non-traditional sectors, such as tourism, which has been allocated significant amounts of foreign investment. In the last 12 years, FDI in the tourism sector amounted to $2.7 billion, representing 12.4% of the total amount registered in the country. Other sectors include real estate, which has provided substantial contributions to the Dominican economy in recent years, both as a source of employment and foreign exchange generator. Mining is also significant, and in the first decade of this century it has been one of the most attractive activities for the reception of foreign investment in the Dominican Republic. The trade and industry sector has also been dynamic in recent years due to increasing labor and productive development, which has generated significant flows of FDI. During the 2000 to June 2013 period, investment in this sector represented 19.6% of the total amount received by the country, at $4.28 billion. ICT also attracts foreign interest. During the 2000 to June 2013 period, FDI attracted by this sector amounted to $2.34 billion. The Dominican Republic has also emerged as a contact center and business process outsourcing (BPO) hub. The contact center industry is one of the fastest growing sectors in the Dominican Republic. Currently, it has been estimated that there are 33,000 agents employed in the industry and approximately 27,400 seats. The projections are that the sector will grow by over 80% over the next five years, anticipating that more than 60,000 agents will be employed in the industry by 2016.</p><h4>How will the government vision to further develop infrastructure, together with the widening of the Panama Canal, impact the Dominican Republic's logistics industry?</h4><p>The strategic location of our island in the center of the Caribbean represents a historic opportunity, which, from the times of the discovery of America, has allowed it to serve as a trade hub and a nerve center where imports and exports converge. This permanent historical advantage is being strengthened by the expansion of the Panama Canal, scheduled for completion in 2015, which will generate the kind of traffic never before seen, including mega post-Panamax and super-Panamax ships, radically changing the dynamics of freight. With the opportunity of transshipment and new marine routes in our vicinity, the Dominican Republic is ready to face the challenge at an optimal leverage, especially through our exports. The Dominican government, through the CEI-RD, has designed a working plan to implement the necessary tasks and promote our country as a hub in the Caribbean, allowing us to achieve the desired levels of development. We have evaluated and visited the main hubs around the world and, based on this benchmarking, have been able to implement the best model in the Dominican Republic. Another factor to have had a positive impact on the development of this hub is the country's modern and efficient transportation network that enables reliable cargo shipment and travel, as well as its excellent system of roads, nine international airports, several domestic terminals in important commercial locations, four cruise ports, and 12 modern cargo ports, including DP World Caucedo, one of the 25 largest ports in the world.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Dominican Republic, the number one tourism destination in the Caribbean, also received more than 4.5 million visitors during 2012, generating revenues of over $4.5 billion.</p><h4>How do you evaluate the main drivers of the economy in the Dominican Republic for the coming years?</h4><p>In spite of the fact that, currently, international markets are undergoing some fluctuations caused mainly by uncertainty generated in a few developed economies, the main economic drivers of the Dominican macroeconomic landscape suggest positive results in the medium term. According to the projections of Plan Nacional Plurianual del Sector Público 2013-2016, developed by the Ministry of Economy, Financial Planning, and Development, we can anticipate annual average GDP growth of 4.5% during the analyzed period. Regarding employment, average growth of 2.8% is expected by creating around 461,000 new jobs.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As a Venezuelan bank, what know-how and expertise are you bringing to the country?<br></h4><p>Being from Venezuela, we have experienced a political transformation over the past 15 years. One of the good things about transformation is that it opens the eyes of entrepreneurs. We define a good country as one where wealth is distributed. Most people in these countries survive on microfinance; however, in most cases the interest rates are at 10% per week, sometimes 1% a day. This creates a harsh loan environment in the micro world for ordinary people, who are often unable to source sufficient funding for their micro business. In the Dominican Republic, 70% of internal production derives from micro business, but less than 10% of those people are banked. The banking system, therefore, is overlooking the bulk of the economy generating most of the national wealth. What we bring from Venezuela is our experience of linking all sides in better dialog.</p><h4>How do your operations add value for clients?</h4><p>We wanted to make a tangible impact in the micro business. If you come to us for a loan of Ps2,000 ($50), you do not want to wait two weeks for it to be approved. And if you come for an even higher loan of Ps8,000 to repair your taxi, for example, waiting spells lost revenue. We issue credit on the spot.</p><h4>How do you target your potential clients?</h4><p>The regular form of business is to open branches, but that means overheads. We acquire the efficiency of a network by accessing more than 2,000 “Colmados," or convenience stores, which deliver us to our target community without the expense of dedicated branches. This said, we have been opening a few for visible presence. When we acquired the bank, it had only one branch, but now has nine.</p><h4>What products and services could extend your portfolio?</h4><p>For insurance companies, their base clients are not consumers, but those that sell the insurance, such as the brokers. Ultimately, very few people call the insurance company; they call the broker. Therefore, insurers arrange new products for brokers to promote and sell. This is what we do in the micro world. We use the agents to sound out the needs of the community. Once I receive information, I try to create a forum for one product to approach and satisfy that need. It is a complete cycle, and a social approach that comes from Venezuela. Not everybody has the same standard of living, or indeed the same perception of what this means. You cannot assess a good standard of living solely in terms of owning consumer electronics, or an air-conditioned home. A good standard of living is having a secure and sustainable lifestyle.</p><h4>With the economy and the main demographics increasing, how will the core drivers in the local banking sector develop?</h4><p>Something that I have noticed in my three-and-a-half years here is a change in the banking sector. One reason for that change is competition from abroad, which the major players are aware of. This sees the banks competing more aggressively today in response, one result of which is a wider range of products on offer at even lower interest rates.</p><h4>Do you foresee any mergers and acquisitions in the finance sector?</h4><p>Some of the larger banks have already started merging, buying time to prepare for the competition that comes with more experience and funds. The banking sector has to reduce the offer. All banks are players, but, globally speaking, they need to focus on the banking offer. With increased minimum capital requirements, we will see more merging or leaving the market, which we are preparing for. Today, we are third in our niche, having risen from 17th place in less than three-and-a-half years. We have over $40 million in assets, ranking us above most banks engaged in multi-banking. Our paid-in capital is also among the highest and three times the threshold stipulated for the multi-banking universe. We are steadfastly progressing to the next step, which we will hopefully reach in 2014, namely entering that universe.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Grupo Piñero achieved its international presence?<br></h4><p>Grupo Piñero is a multinational company established in Spain with over 40 years of experience in the tourism industry. The dynamic entrepreneurial character of the Piñero family has been one of the key elements underpinning success. I would say that experience is one of our core strengths; although the company first started with its tour operator Soltour, today it has become a hospitality sector giant, owning the prestigious “Bahí­a Prí­ncipe" hotel chain. Over the years, the company has diversified its portfolio, today being active across a comprehensive range of tourism services such as passenger transport, retail travel agencies, and residential tourism real estate, among others. We entered the latter segment with our Playa Nueva Romana real estate project having identified many opportunities with clients who enjoyed spending holidays in the area, and were highly satisfied with the services of our company. Our real estate resort is a 6.5 million sqm development, located just 45 minutes from the international airport of Santo Domingo, 15 minutes from La Romana international airport, and 70 minutes from that of Punta Cana. One of our slogans is Make dreams come true, and entering this particular business clearly showcases who we are as a company. As for group synergies, our clients appreciate the solidity of our business group at the international level. This is a key element for our clients when it comes to deciding on the purchase of a service or property through our company. Our Bahí­a Prí­ncipe hotels are present in Spain, Jamaica, Mexico, and the Dominican Republic, with 12 hotels and over 6,000 rooms, employing 6,000 people in the Dominican Republic alone.</p><h4>What are some of your competitive advantages in the residential tourism real estate sector?</h4><p>We offer numerous complementary services alongside the property itself, with many integrated facilities included. The projects we develop always feature appealing and dynamic hotels, as well as restaurants, casinos, beaches, spas and wellness areas, sports facilities, and shopping areas. All facilities are part of the property offering, with each client becoming another member of the family. Additionally, our experience in the sector enables us to offer highly competitive products from a price-to-quality margin perspective, as well as a much-differentiated product thanks to the surroundings and quality of the final product.</p><h4>What do tourists look for in the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>Nature is one of the main tourist draws, as well as the climate. Yet, all clients are different, and for that reason we try to provide them with the chief entertainment features they expect when vacationing in the Dominican Republic. In terms of countries of origin, tourists come mainly from the US, Canada, Europe, and Russia; however, over the past few years, we have seen a rise in the number of South American arrivals.</p><h4>What is the ratio of local to international travellers?</h4><p>In 2012, the Dominican Republic received around 4 million international foreign visitors, while around 700,000 tourists were Dominican citizens. That makes a ratio of around 80:20.</p><h4>What are the company's main plans in the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>We plan to continue building hotels as well as complementary services for the villas we currently develop. Our main goal is to develop a small town that clients need not leave, featuring schools, health, sports and entertainment facilities, as well as beaches, and nature.</p><h4>What is your medium term outlook for the tourism sector?</h4><p>I have always believed that tourism is the only economic sector capable of swiftly changing a country, as has been the case already. The future prospects for the industry, and of other economic sectors, are positive, because the country has performed economically in a challenging international environment.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does the business network in Santo Domingo compare with the other economic areas of the Dominican Republic, and what are its strengths?<br></h4><p>The business network in Santo Domingo is organized, representative, and coordinated. Numerous business associations that operate throughout Greater Santo Domingo is representative in the sense of covering a wide range of sectors of the national economy. Umbrella organizations, such as the National Council of Private Enterprise (CONEP), the Industry Association of the Dominican Republic (AIRD), the National Organization of Commercial Companies (ONEC), or our own Santo Domingo Chamber of Commerce and Production focus on particular issues in coordinating participating companies.</p><h4>Who are the principal economic players in the Dominican market?</h4><p>I cannot identify a small group of players that monopolize the economic activity of the country. Because today, we are approaching a genuinely democratic business environment, wherein each sector and each participant has a valid point of view, and where no one is sidelined. The process of harmonizing these diverse representative organizations is enriching the business sector.</p><h4>Why is the development of a diversified economy important for the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>A diversified economy ensures, as the old saying goes, that we don't put all our eggs in one basket. And thus through diversification can we counteract the fluctuations of commercial and industrial activity. The role of the Santo Domingo Chamber of Commerce and Production, and that of all the regional chambers that nationally comprise the Fedocámaras, or federation of chambers, is to have an even and balanced point of agreement for all members. These members come from every corner of the country and are businesses or companies of varying sizes from the full range of economic sectors. As such, the chambers of commerce and production, like that of Santo Domingo, become the ideal arena in which to discuss and make proposals regarding public policy geared toward the sustainable development of the national economy. On a daily basis, we assume such responsibility either independently, or by joining forces with the rest of the business sector in Santo Domingo, and the country at large.</p><h4>How can you encourage the private sector to contribute to economic development in Santo Domingo?</h4><p>As everyone in the country recognizes, this collaboration is indispensable, and without it we would become divided and end up in an endless struggle between public and private sector interests. Indeed, through the Santo Domingo Chamber of Commerce and Production, we provide critical support and collaborate efficiently with every public sector initiative, starting, for example, with the Company Register and the SMEs program, recently favored by the national authorities. Another example of this public-private collaboration is the setting up of the Single Window, through which to reduce costs and facilitate the establishment of new companies.</p><h4>What are the main business opportunities that Santo Domingo is providing to companies?</h4><p>The Dominican Republic is situated in a privileged and strategic geographic position in terms of the Caribbean and Central America. However, we should recognize that we haven't made the most of our potential in this sense, perhaps because we haven't been capable of overcoming an island mentality. However, we seem more aware of these advantages today, which is evident from the major investments that have converted our ports into regional hubs. We also have examples of industries that have successfully penetrated international markets. However, our potential is much greater, and in this sense it is necessary for the public and private sectors to unite in designing and implementing a strategy that allows us to take advantage of our location.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the development of the local economy over the past year?<br></h4><p>From an entrepreneurial perspective, I think it has been a positive period for the country; the government's main aim has been to adopt a fresh approach. For example, it has allowed people to borrow money through Banca Solidaria, a newly-established bank that gives people of limited economic resources an opportunity to change their lives. I think this tool will boost national development, as I believe Dominicans have great talent and creativity, but a lack of economic resources. The government has also taken important steps to boost the national economy in several strategic sectors, such as agriculture, by providing broader funding opportunities. One good example of that would be the mango industry, which has grown well over the past year.</p><h4>How would you assess changes to Dominicans' entrepreneurial spirit?</h4><p>I can see that Dominicans are increasingly willing to take part in the growth of the country, and realizing the importance of working hand-in-hand with the government in the country's best interest. I can say the same about industrial and entrepreneur associations at the national level. At the same time, I think the government has to become more involved in providing support for their development and the further industrial growth of the Dominican Republic. Lately, we have also seen the establishment of different industrial clusters between Dominican companies that seek to unite efforts and optimize resources and activity in order to become more competitive and efficient, which is an encouraging sign of development at all levels.</p><h4>What role does a newspaper like El Nuevo Diario play in bringing the authorities and society closer together?</h4><p>We have always aimed at displaying the government's action, regardless of political persuasion, because we believe that Dominicans must know what their government is doing. In this context, we do not discriminate between good and bad government action; we try to show the reality of our country and government through the pages of El Nuevo Diario. That also applies to international news.</p><h4>What are the logistics and distribution challenges facing El Nuevo Diario?</h4><p>Due to the characteristics of the Dominican Republic, and the fact that not everybody has internet access, El Nuevo Diario does not have nationwide coverage. Our ideal would be to reach the entire country; however, we have to understand that I have inherited a rather conservative company from my father. I personally have a more entrepreneurial point of view; my challenge is to make our company more commercial and attain broader coverage. My duty now is to transmit this vision to all El Nuevo Diario employees because, at the end of the day, they will be the ones making such change possible.</p><h4>Where do you see El Nuevo Diario in the future?</h4><p>I see El Nuevo Diario becoming a nationwide newspaper that will be read by a wide range of people. Also, I think we must expand our presence in the US market, as we have correspondents there. Therefore, we are working toward making the El Nuevo Diario brand better known among Dominicans.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the attraction of the Dominican Republic as a foreign investment destination?<br></h4><p>The strong macroeconomic performance of the Dominican Republic over the past eight years, as well as the country's political stability, legal security, and social peace, have been the main incentives attracting new businesses and investors. Since 2005, the Dominican Republic has posted average annual growth of 6.7%, above the Latin American average of 4.3% for the period. In addition, we controlled inflation at an average of 6.2% during this period and enjoyed relative exchange rate stability, with an average depreciation of 3.2%. These favorable results were achieved thanks to structural reforms in the financial system and the use of more open trade policies and strategies.</p><h4>What are the main highlights of the financial policies adopted by the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic (BCRD)?</h4><p>We are convinced that key to achieving sustainable economic growth is sustained price stability, as well as ensuring the proper functioning of the financial and payment systems in our country. Only then can business and people schedule their consumption plans, savings, and investments with relative certainty, creating the necessary conditions for long-term growth.</p><h4>What economic sectors hold the highest growth potential?</h4><p>Our economy has, in recent years, received the highest ever levels of foreign investment in various economic sectors such as mining, trade, industry, tourism, and real estate. Without a doubt, the mining sector will see greater dynamism in the coming years, especially thanks to Barrick Gold's mining operations; we also have bright prospects for tourism, free trade zones (FTZs), and agribusiness. Additionally, we expect the financial sector to maintain the solid performance it has shown in recent years.</p><div class="quote">“  Overall, the financial sector has become healthier to the point where today it maintains performance indicators well above international standards. "</div><h4>In your opinion, how can investment and the industrial sector evolve over the next few years?</h4><p>In May, the BCRD implemented a series of expansionary measures to stimulate private sector credit and domestic demand; we released approximately Ps20 billion of resources from legal reserves (equivalent to more than 3%) to be channeled into the productive sectors to finance projects at historically low interest rates for a fixed term of six years. Specifically, these resources targeted manufacturing, agriculture, and the purchase of housing units, as well as trade, SMEs, and consumers. These monetary measures have resulted in a more dynamic credit climate in the private sector, growing at an annual rate of around 15%, which, along, with increased public investment in recent months, has contributed to the revival of economic activity. We expect our economy to grow by approximately 3% in 2013, rising to 4% or 5% in 2014.</p><h4>What strategies is the BCRD implementing to encourage further specialization of the national economy?</h4><p>We are aware that timely and adequate funding is a prerequisite for the growth of all economic sectors. Accordingly, we encourage greater access to credit for economic agents, reducing the costs of financial intermediation and promoting a more efficient allocation of financial resources. In particular, we have taken steps to ease the credit approval criteria for small debtors and reduce legal reserve requirements for commercial banks from 20% to 12.3%. Furthermore, we have supported the development of the mortgage and trust markets, as well as the creation of sub-banking agent services. The BCRD has also contributed to the development of the stock market, both by supporting actions taken by the Securities Superintendency (SIV) and by deepening the internal stock market through the issuance of securities in accordance with international standards. In fact, we are the largest issuers of securities in the country.</p><h4>How is the institution promoting further financial transparency in the national economy?</h4><p>Transparency is the bedrock of economic agents' expectations and accountability. We have strengthened our communications policy and the dissemination of information, particularly concerning the decision-making process. For example, we publish monthly statements after each monetary policy meeting, as well as biannual economic projections, and we also hold regular press conferences to report on economic performance. Additionally, the BCRD publishes quarterly economic reports, the result of all monetary transactions, and guidelines for the implementation of monetary policy through the monetary program.</p><h4>What actions has the BCRD taken to promote further modernization in the financial sector?</h4><p>On the one hand, we have regulated a more competitive and transparent banking sector with a varied range of well-regulated products such as development of the mortgage and trust markets, the creation of sub-banking agent services, and the regulation of credit cards. Other initiatives aim at strengthening the banking and financial culture of economic agents; we created the Central Classroom (Aula Central) project, and the Diploma on Economic Journalism, as well staging communication seminars on economics. We also plan to implement a National Financial Literacy Survey, which will help to develop a national strategy in this context. On the other hand, we have made significant progress in open market operations with, for example, the dematerialization of securities issued by the BCRD, which contributed to the deepening of the secondary stock market.</p><h4>What steps is the BCRD taking to promote macroeconomic growth for 2013 and beyond?</h4><p>In early 2013, our economy was affected by a combination of a moderation in global economic growth and a decline in domestic demand, due to the impact of a new tax reform. These factors led to growth of 0.3% during the January-March period of 2013. Faced with this reality and in an environment of low inflationary pressure, we decided to cut, by 75 basis points, the monetary policy rate, while releasing around Ps20 billion from legal reserve resources. We also eased credit conditions for small debtors, facilitating the recovery of private loans. As a result of these measures, as well as increased capital spending in the public sector, the economy recovered to grow 5.5% in 3Q2013. We expect this to continue, bringing year-end growth to our projected 3%.</p><h4>The implementation of laws and regulations in line with Basel principles has ensured the banking sector's high levels of solvency, capitalization, and profitability. What challenges does the economy face in sustaining its pace in light of peso-dollar volatility?</h4><p>In light of our objective of maintaining price stability, we would adopt necessary measures to prevent high exchange rate volatility from jeopardizing our inflation target. The banking sector maintains high levels of solvency, capitalization, and profitability, as well as a long position in foreign currencies, which are factors reducing that vulnerability. Additionally, current regulation sets a limit on the channeling of loans to sectors that do not generate foreign exchange currency, mitigating credit exchange risks. The banking sector as a whole is funded locally in pesos and does not offer as wide a variety of instruments as developed markets.</p><h4>How would you assess ties with the IMF?</h4><p>Relations with the IMF are excellent. Recently, we received welcome feedback regarding the Fund's evaluation of Post-Program Monitoring (PPM) for the country. In the monetary context, we decided to increase the BCRD's benchmark interest rate by 200 basis points due to strong pressure in the exchange market that would have endangered our inflation target. On the fiscal side, the government has implemented a successful reform that will reduce the deficit by about 4% of GDP. I should stress that, over the past eight years, the Dominican Republic has signed two stand-by agreements with the IMF, both highly positive for the country; the BCRD has fully complied with all set goals, which has allowed us to strengthen our reserves, meet inflation targets, and contribute to maintaining macroeconomic stability. We have also passed new laws to strengthen public sector institutions, eliminated several subsidies, and pursued more efficient tax administration. Overall, the financial sector has become healthier to the point where today it maintains performance indicators well above international standards. We understand that we must focus on completing the PPM agreement, which is scheduled for 2014. Depending on local conditions and the international economic climate, the government could evaluate the possibility, in the future, of engaging in a new agreement with the IMF beneficial to the country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does the Superintendency play in bringing together the economic growth of the country and increasing demand for a more secure generation and national distribution of electricity?<br></h4><p>The General Law on Electricity was passed in 2001, the same year in which the Electricity Superintendency was established, and this law was modified in 2007. The Dominican Republic is rapidly growing, which poses certain challenges from an energy perspective, as the country has to distribute the energy needed to numerous industries, not least of which is tourism, to carry out their activities and contribute to the development of the country. On the other hand, the country has experienced an improvement in the generation and distribution of electric energy since 2001; around 800 MW of installed capacity in different plants has shifted toward more efficient generation practices. In terms of projects and policies, the most important is the tender process for two coal-fired plants set to generate electricity with a joint installed capacity of 600 MW. For example, there have already been some projects and proposals to increase installed capacity, such as a 300-MW facility based on coal in the Itabo Industrial Park. Additionally, Law No. 5707 sets out a certain amount of subsidies for those projects related to energy generation from renewable energies.</p><h4>How does the Superintendency work to balance the demands of distributors for increased electricity tariffs, with the consumer demand for more inexpensive energy?</h4><p>Setting electricity tariffs has to be done according to a particular technical scheme based on how efficient companies are, and the government has developed a plan accordingly; however, it has yet to come into force. Such development is still pending, and one of the main challenges we face is to incorporate the retail electricity market into this scheme. Regarding the consumer dimension, the general law on electricity stipulated the establishment of an Office of Consumer Protection, or PROTECOM, in each of the main urban areas of the country. Currently, the Superintendency has a presence in 17 provinces of the country, and we expect to open around 14 additional offices to ensure national coverage. PROTECOM enables consumers to resist the monopolies that certain distribution companies exert in their tendered area, and the Superintendency helps to further its expansion. Basically, PROTECOM works as a bridge between distribution companies and consumers who claim they have suffered from bad service or practices. PROTECOM investigates claims and disagreements between the two sides, as well as irregularities.</p><h4>What are your challenges and goals for 2014 and beyond?</h4><p>We want to render the regulatory framework well respected and efficient, passing the amendments needed to strengthen it. We understand that the development of the sector has to be based on a strong institutional framework rather than the current players in the sector, as that could risk the future development of the industry; our goal is for the sector to sustainably grow over the course of the next few years. Additionally, the Superintendency prepared a quality standard on commercial services for consumers in March of 2012 to provide a better framework for both consumer and distributor; it aims to further increase the role of new technologies among distributors in order to better monitor the quality of their services and billing, among other goals. Its implementation had been scheduled for August 2013, but the slow adoption of technology processes among distributors has led to a postponement of the standards coming into force. Efficiency at all levels, especially in terms of the generation and distribution of electrical energy, has to be a common goal among all players in the sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the energy related reforms implemented recently by the Dominican government, and how have they impacted the market?<br></h4><p>For the past 20 years we thought that in order to make the energy system more efficient we should increase tariffs and reduce costs. However, that did not prove to be the right approach, as we came to understand that the change in the energy production matrix was the factor contributing the most to the better development of the market. Today, 60% of the electricity the Dominican Republic consumes is indexed at prices similar to those of oil, which means that production costs are high and competitive levels low. We are working on the transformation of large fuel-based plants into natural gas and carbon-based facilities, as well as the construction of a natural gas plant to supply the future needs of the country and the electricity energy generation sector. Only once we achieve the transition in the energy production matrix will we be able to reduce costs and tariffs.</p><h4>How does the CDEEE strike a balance between the interests and demands of end users and distribution companies?</h4><p>Were we to transfer the entire cost of the energy generation process to the clients, some customers would be required to pay 160% more than what they currently do, which would be unsustainable. The only way to make the entire process more efficient is by reducing generation costs and the overall deficit of the industry, which reached around $1.3 billion by the end of 2013.</p><h4>What are some of the biggest challenges to the combining of efforts between electrical energy generation and distribution companies?</h4><p>The National Integrated Plan is aimed at doing precisely this, and bringing closer both the public and private sectors to achieve common goals. For example, we currently implement 82 projects at the national level to upgrade and rehabilitate the electricity network, as well as to install better metric counters. The above-mentioned plan is around 50% focused on the production sphere, 35% on the losses of the distribution channels, and 15% on management efficiency. These processes will take up to five years. Meanwhile, we are also encouraging renewables, and have 1,500 MW worth of tenders under consideration.</p><h4>What is the impact on the entire system of providing electrical energy to key industrial sectors such as mining?</h4><p>It is hard for public authorities to keep up with the current pace of development of the national industry, and future demand trends are not at all optimistic, with research studies indicating that we must urgently install between 600 MW and 1,400 MW to meet the future demand of the industrial sector. In this context, the government has already taken the lead by sponsoring the development of the first 600 MW carbon-based plan to address future demand issues. Additionally, we are looking into potential natural gas based projects to cover the remaining 800 MW shortfall. Our goal is also to attract back into the system those companies that are currently auto-generators, as that is a factor that currently reduces competitiveness, especially at the export level.</p><h4>Are there any future plans for the commercialization of electrical energy?</h4><p>The main goal in this field is to reduce losses, as that will provide distribution companies with a better cash inflow from collections, enabling them to target future expansion and upgrading plans with their own resources. At the moment, we require international financing to defray the costs of such plans to reduce losses. We have implemented both public and private initiatives to strengthen commercialization, and are open to analyzing any potential plans to privatize the electricity commercialization of areas that could benefit both company and country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What led Grupo Bepensa to decide to settle in the Dominican Republic?<br></h4><p>The Bepensa Group is a renowned Mexican company with international operations in the Dominican Republic. With more than 60 years in the business, it is the largest commercial, industrial, and services corporation in the Southeast of Mexico, and has been present in the Dominican Republic since 2006. In that year, Bepensa signed a strategic alliance with Refrescos Nacionales, the bottling company for Coca-Cola, and decided to settle in the Dominican Republic. Our decision was motivated by the country's stability, security, and guaranteed growth, which we considered to be the ideal scenario for our internationalization beyond Mexico. During the past seven years, our extensive experience in the production, bottling, and distribution of non-alcoholic beverages has allowed us to turn Bepensa Dominicana into in a leading company, offering quality products that have generated over 2,500 direct and 10,000 indirect jobs, positively reinforcing the industrial sector and national economy in general.</p><h4>In addition to the creation of jobs and the supply of quality products, what is the company's commitment to the consumer and to Dominicans in general?</h4><p>Bepensa Dominicana is a socially responsible company with a solid commitment to the development of the country and the communities in which we operate. This is why we have constant and concrete actions that contribute to both the preservation of the environment, and the educational development of the population. In that sense, we participate and support initiatives and non-profit organizations, such as The Nature Conservancy (TNC), with whom we have recently signed a partnership agreement to work on the recovery and conservation of rivers and watersheds in the Dominican Republic. Bepensa Dominicana Social Responsibility programs are part of the overall strategy of The Coca-Cola Company's Live Positively campaign. This proposes a life philosophy that will join efforts to make our planet a better place to live in. It is a commitment that both Coca-Cola and Bepensa Dominicana have taken to make a difference and a positive global impact. This strategy is based on sustainability as the way to create a change in the world that will ensure a social, environmental, economic, and political future for upcoming generations. As part of this initiative, we promote active and healthy lifestyles, motivating consumers to achieve an energy balance and tackle the problem of obesity that affects millions of people around the world.</p><h4>What is the key to Bepensa Dominicana's success in maintaining its leadership status in Dominican industry?</h4><p>Bepensa Dominicana invests significantly in safety, production, and quality control processes. Since 2006, our company has allocated more than $134 million to the modernization and expansion of facilities, the distribution fleet, machinery, buildings, IT, cooling equipment, and vending machines. From 2006 to 2012, our bottling facility grew by 150%, increasing the efficiency of our production lines from 30% to more than 70%. We are the only company in the Dominican Republic to operate with four international ISO certifications. These efforts have allowed us to improve our efficiency and to expand our product portfolio, which now includes juice, isotonic, and energy drinks, and flavored waters in our quest to satisfy the different tastes and lifestyles of our consumers. Nowadays, Bepensa Dominicana bottles and distributes 13 brands reaching more than 65,000 customers. We have a bottling facility, eight production lines, 10 distribution centers, and 252 routes that cover the entire country.</p><div class="quote">“  Nowadays, Bepensa Dominicana bottles and distributes 13 brands reaching more than 65,000 customers. "</div><h4>What are the company's expectations and action plan for 2014?</h4><p>We hope to continue growing and paying special attention to the demands of our consumers and market. We will be on top of the areas requiring improvement, innovation needs, and the demand for new products. Ultimately, this is what makes us stand out from the competition, and we will continue to focus our efforts in this regard. Finally, we hope to broaden our commitment to social responsibility, recycling, and the protection of the environment. Moreover, we will continue to develop programs, hand-in-hand with Coca-Cola, under this program. And meanwhile, our promotion of physical activity among citizens of all ages confirms our commitment to an active and healthy lifestyle.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the dominant trends in the Dominican Republic's IT sector?<br></h4><p>I see four mega-trends in the IT market. The first is the adoption of ICT by SMEs. Over the years, more and more small companies have been investing in ICT, to the extent that we believe that there are 50,000 such enterprises in the domestic market consuming technology. Yet, of those, only 1,000 were purchasing technology in any a given year, which was a low percentage. In 2012, that figure tripled to 3,000, in line with the government's plan to foster greater ICT investment and use in the Dominican Republic. The second trend involves interest from large-scale organizations, such as banks and insurance companies, in increased consumer-oriented ICT services. A third trend is the use of cloud computing. And the fourth mega-trend is in mobile phones, as more and more Dominicans use smart phones. There are as many as 130,000 in the market, which is half the number of PCs. We generate about 70% to 80% of all software services in this country, meaning that our market share in the Dominican Republic is one of the largest in Latin America.</p><h4>How does Microsoft benefit from those trends?</h4><p>SMEs are extremely important, not just for Microsoft, but for the overall economy, as they generate about 90% of all jobs. We are transforming Microsoft into a services and devices company, so the more SMEs start to see ICT as a necessary investment in their businesses, the better it is, not only for the overall ICT industry, but also for Microsoft in particular. We are helping to expand the market by selling to more companies, having tripled our sales in the sector. We also work closely with the government through several agencies, trying to help companies grasp the importance of systematic integration of ICT into their businesses, and to perceive the importance of ICT as an investment.</p><h4>Which products generate the most sales?</h4><p>Operating systems and productivity tools such as Office (including Word and Power Point), and so forth, account for about 50% of our market share in the Dominican Republic. However, over the past two years, enterprise services have risen dramatically, accounting for the other 50%. Growth of the enterprise business is outpacing that of the consumer business. With mobility being a key trend in evidence globally and locally, we are also highly focused in this area with products such as Windows 8.1 for tablets and PCs, and in the continued growth of Windows Phone. In Latin America in 2Q2013, IDC stated in their quarterly mobile phone tracker that Windows Phone was the second most preferred OS in the region. No company offers more services in the cloud than Microsoft, and moreover, on our customer's terms. Cloud computing is revolutionary in allowing companies to use as much of the service as they need, unlike in the past when they would have to invest in hardware and networks.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2014?</h4><p>The fiscal year ending 2013 was a tough period—a year of transformation. Internal GDP declined to as low as 2%, which is unprecedented in recent years. However, we perceive considerable opportunity in the Dominican Republic's economy. When you compare our economy to the size of the country and population, it is remarkably large. There is much growth potential, and the more the economy grows, the more we will grow along with it, as companies can no longer do without ICT. Whether you are the owner of a restaurant, a hotel, or a bank, ICT is crucial. If we can spread ICT through better tools and better internet connections and infrastructure, we could triple the GDP of our country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the current condition of the logistics sector in the Dominican Republic?<br></h4><p>The sector is undergoing a major transformation toward becoming a regional hub, especially now that the Panama Canal is undergoing renovation works. The Caucedo Maritime Port is a part of the infrastructure driving this transformation. Overall, this is a hugely positive transformation for sector and country alike, which will clearly increase the volume of cargo transported. A concerted effort is needed now to transform the Dominican Republic into a more industrialized nation, rather than a pit stop for cargo before reaching its final destination. Certain challenges remain however, and we need a more open trade union at ports to avoid the monopolization of businesses, and must accelerate road infrastructure construction. Additionally, new industrial parks are required to increase our industrial offering.</p><h4>How does Yobel service its nationwide network of clients?</h4><p>The Dominican Republic is only around 48,500 square kilometers in size, which enables us to reach the main industrial points, regardless of location, within two or three hours. Therefore, we do not require new distribution centers beyond Santo Domingo, but can do for special projects where required. Yobel achieves high efficiency levels, thanks to its work model and organizational structure. Our main competitive advantages are time efficiency, competitive prices and focus on high quality standards and customer service.</p><h4>How do your clients benefit from Yobel being a multinational company present in many countries in the region?</h4><p>We currently have clients that purchase goods abroad and leverage our synergies as a multinational to get their goods delivered. In terms of the advantages of being part of a multinational, the support of considerable experience in supply chain management of over 40 years and a presence in 13 countries; this combined with the permanent optimization of its industrial and logistics capabilities, has enabled Yobel SCM to build a proposal to help companies identify and implement operational improvements with high added value.</p><p>The main attributes of the Yobel SCM's value proposal are know-how and technology transfer, common goods distribution and storage practices, lower costs for our clients, a capable and skilled workforce, international certified processes and employees, and above all the professionalism and confidence of our daily drive towards continuous improvement. We operate directly through our branch network to ensure efficient service.</p><h4>What are the challenges in terms of recruiting and maintaining human resources in the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>The Dominican workforce is hardworking and capable; however, improvement is required in terms of education. Regarding management positions, the workforce is highly skilled and qualified, thanks to several well-established free trade zones in operation, which, in fact, have helped develop knowledge and skills through know-how transfer. Over the past few years, we have also observed a rise in the number of Dominican professionals pursuing studies abroad.</p><h4>What sectors are your clients mostly active in?</h4><p>We have a wide range of clients, and our strategy is to work on market segmentation for the next few years. We identify the needs of industry and client, and based on that, offer the services required, delivering added value. We have clients from sectors including cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, IT, mass-consumption products, construction, mining, and the food industry.</p><h4>What is Yobel's 2014 growth strategy?</h4><p>We have an aggressive and ambitious plan for 2014; we expect to grow at the same level as in previous years—by between 12% and 15%, annually. To this end, we are implementing new technologies and our clients are already benefiting. We will continue working toward the international certification of our workforce, and plan to commence operations elsewhere within the country to expand our customer portfolio. We expect to continue growing in terms of capacity as well as volume.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the challenges for the development of the agricultural sector in the country?<br></h4><p>The Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the UN has a long history of supporting and strengthening agriculture, although in recent years it has focused more on hunger and hunger education. The Dominican Republic has already reached the Millennium Development goal of halving the number of people experiencing hunger. In 1991 and 1992, more than 30% of Dominicans were under-nourished. For 2013, our figures indicate a figure of 15.6%. At the same time, we have to recognize that the situation has not improved in a number of countries, despite good agricultural conditions and possibilities. We have found an encouraging environment for working here, because the government wants to reduce poverty, which is the other side of the coin of food insecurity. If poverty reduction is part of the country's development initiatives, it supports and strengthens food security in the country. It is not only a question of having food available, as access and the capacity to manage and be able to buy and use the food are also crucial elements. In the Dominican Republic, we have noted that about 7% of GDP comes from agriculture, and about 14% of employment. In certain areas, production and productivity are lower than in neighboring countries with similar conditions. From the point of view of food security, the major crops are rice and plantains. And in terms of area planted, rice is the main crop in the country. The rice production level could be better as productivity is generally low, because the use of technology is limited and knowledge lacking. We see this as one of the major challenges in agricultural production. In terms of the entire value-added chain, from production to final product, there are not many activities in the Dominican Republic. There are only a few companies producing food items here, and often, primary products are exported. There are many opportunities to correct this and, at the same time, provide more employment and make better use of the natural resources of the country itself.</p><h4>What are you doing to improve the conditions of small-scale farmers?</h4><p>Around 70% of the Dominican Republic's producers are smallholders and are also the majority of the staple food producers of plantains and rice. However, the last agricultural census was taken in 1981, so with the National Bureau of Statistics and the Ministry of Agriculture, the process of launching an agricultural census is underway. Often, farmers do not have land titles, and where a title is lacking, credit is difficult to obtain. Also, we are assisting the National Water Resource Institute in developing a new law for water management, covering issues of water distribution. Similarly, we are working with the Ministry of the Environment, which is responsible for the forestry sector, in order to improve its legal measures so that national forests can be better utilized.</p><h4>Where are the major technology and equipment requirements in the meat, fish, and crop sub-sectors?</h4><p>National consumption of fish is low, but this has to do with history, tradition, and also with storage problems. Fish needs to be fresh, or else the know how to treat it is essential, and the transportation of fish was not easy in former times. The National Commission CODOPESCA is working with its members in a number of areas. Recently, we have been conducting a study on Lake Enriquillo, which is expanding and is causing farmers to lose their land. We have observed that there are many crabs today in Lake Enriquillo and we are trying to train some farmers in fishing practices in order to compensate for their loss of land. To this end, we are initiating projects for the selling and packaging of crab meat.</p><h4>What is next for the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>Approximately 1.6 million to 1.7 million Dominicans do not get adequate daily food, which is a shame for a country with a per capita GDP rate of $5,600 to $5,800. Poverty has remained at around 50% in rural areas and at about 40% in urban areas, which has not changed over recent years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the highlight achievements of ARS Palic in the Dominican insurance industry?<br></h4><p>ANDRÉS MEJÍA Ours is a company that stands out for its vast experience in the sector and its strong economic and financial support—we are the partner-company of Grupo Financiero BHD and Grupo Sura. These are two business groups highly recognized in their respective countries, which decided to enter the Dominican market during a period of reform in the health insurance, having foreseen considerable business opportunities. While the oldest insurance sector company in the Dominican Republic, it underwent a rebranding process in the early 2000s, from which ARS Palic was born in 2003. The firm was established as a result of the groups' social commitment to the nation. In this context, we have been the fastest growing company in the market over the past five years, which has made ARS Palic the leading institution in many segments of the insurance sector, having enabled us to gain trust and a strong reputation throughout society.</p><h4>What are the main benefits of being part of as strong a business group as Grupo Financiero BHD?</h4><p>Being part of such a strong financial group has given us a boost in terms of reputation and recognition among many individuals and companies from day one, as well as market positioning. Also, being a partner of Grupo Sura—a key player in the development of the health sector in Colombia—has given us other competitive advantages, such as know-how.</p><h4>How does ARS Palic work toward educating the population on insurance products and services?</h4><p>The insurance industry currently accounts for around 1.3% of GDP, which is less than observed among our regional neighbors. And for that reason, the insurance market in the Dominican Republic still offers much growth potential. That 1.3% could easily be doubled, and, in fact, I would add that the health insurance segment is one of the fastest growing, offering the greatest potential. Approximately 10 years ago, health insurance represented just a small segment of large insurance companies' business, whereas today it has outgrown the general insurance segment, which is why there are now companies exclusively dedicated to this particular line. However, there are a few things to keep in mind when talking about the health insurance segment; 65% to 70% of the income of companies similar to ARS Palic derives from social insurance. For that reason, we must work on educating people about insurance, and our development is tightly linked to the expansion of the country's labor market. Therefore, as the informal economy declines, the sector will grow. In this context, we are working toward that goal with the authorities and various other institutions. However, that is a common goal at the national level, because the informal economy still represents 55% of the overall economy. Additionally, as per capita expenditure grows, so too will the sector.</p><h4>What are the products with which ARS Palic is experiencing the fastest growth?</h4><p>The current balance of our income is 65% from social insurance and 35% from private plans. However, high levels of inflation are impacting our products and those of the entire health insurance sector.</p><h4>What measures does ARS Palic implement regarding quality control among its providers?</h4><p>Currently, we have over 5,000 service providers, though the standardization of their processes is rather complex. However, we hold daily meetings with both service providers and clients in pursuit of excellence, which is one of our key goals as a company. Additionally, we continuously apply international protocols to improve the quality of our services and products, and carry  out internal controls to the most exacting standards. We train our employees in this field to strongly develop such processes in-house, and I consider this to be another of our competitive advantages today.</p><h4>How is ARS Palic building bridges with its clients?</h4><p>The relationship between ARS Palic and its clients is built through several other agents. However, we have positively worked to get closer to our clients, while respecting the work of our agents. In this context, we carry out hundreds of activities annually at the premises of those companies to build such links. Additionally, we have subscribed the company to many social events and activities in the social sphere related to the prevention of health hazards and diseases. For example, we became involved in activities and health campaigns that concern the whole world, such as breast cancer prevention. ARS Palic is very concerned about this disease, and we decided not to charge any co-payments to patients undergoing a mammography. Finally, I would like to highlight our large investment in PR and marketing aimed at getting closer to our clients. We have also deployed mobile units for people to better learn how to conduct self-checks to prevent breast cancer with highly qualified doctors who dispense advice. This is just one example of the kind of activities we carry out to promote ARS Palic and stand out amid such a competitive industry. Since 2009, we have also been official patrons of Operation Smile, an international foundation that aims to reintegrate into society disadvantaged children suffering from cleft palate or lip problems, through free reconstructive surgery. With this project, we have given smiles to more than 400 children.</p><h4>What are the company's expectations for 2014?</h4><p>Our plans include providing continuity to the organic growth process we undertook some years ago, maintaining our leadership position in the industry, and increasing our market share—we currently have a 21% market share in the private sector. What's more, we will continue to update our services and products to meet the demands and needs of the market, all while continuing to invest in technology across all of our processes. In fact, I should highlight that we are the only ARS in the country offering its own interactive mobile app to our customers. Finally, we will also expand our national branch network to better cover the geography of the Dominican Republic, and our clients.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of the Universidad Nacional Pedro Henrí­quez Ureña (UNPHU)?<br></h4><p>We were the first private university in Santo Domingo, and are one of the oldest universities in the city. UNPHU was established in 1966 after breaking away from the State University during a time when there was a lack of higher education options, especially those without political or religious links. Today, we are run as a non-profit organization with strong support from a group of businessmen. We can proudly say that currently there are more than 30,000 graduates of UNPHU, and our strongest departments are medicine, veterinary science, dentistry, engineering, agronomy, and architecture (the first in the Dominican Republic), among others. In fact, our graduate architects have considerably contributed to transforming the urban landscape of the country. Our medicine, veterinary, and dentistry students take their exams in the US, which enables them to work professionally both there and in Puerto Rico. I would say that one of our strongest competitive advantages is the array of international agreements we have with other universities. We have a strong focus on the US, but also Mexico and Europe; for example, in Spain, we have agreements with the Medicine Faculty of the University of Seville and the architecture department of the University of Barcelona. As part of this internationalization process, we also have to comply with high standards, and many agencies and universities we have partnerships with come to visit our premises to ensure that we meet the required educational standards. We currently have seven faculties (architecture, health sciences, education, science and technology, social sciences, law, and economics), with around 450 professors and 7,140 students.</p><h4>What are the core values and missions of the university?</h4><p>At UNPHU we train students to become capable of becoming agents of change in the country. Our high academic standards and the recognition of our graduates demonstrate our strong commitment to society. Our mission is to contribute to the sustainable development and improvement of society through the education we provide to graduate students who are competitive in their fields and committed to innovation. Our values include academic excellence, responsibility, integrity, ethics, equality, social and environmental commitment, and diversity.</p><h4>What is the average profile of your students, and how do you see the university expanding in the near future?</h4><p>Of our 7,100 students, around 30% enjoy scholarships due to the lack of sufficient funds to access higher education and their strong academic qualifications. Also, we have middle- to upper-class students in our university, providing a perfect mix of individuals in an academic environment. There are currently over 70 foreign students at UNPHU, mainly from the US and Spain, and we expect to increase such figures in the years to come. We also have plans to expand our student body to approximately 8,000, as well as extend our campus. We perceive for the first time ever a common feeling between all social agents to push education to the forefront of our development and prioritize it over other sectors. The sector's budget today represents 4% of GDP, up from 2% a couple of years ago. However, we must keep one thing in mind: we won't see the results of such efforts in the short term.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>In your opinion, what are the differentiating elements that form the Dominican identity?<br></h4><p>Cultural identity is an essential cornerstone of the Ministry's cultural management efforts; we must understand that even with the rapid changes that society has experienced with globalization, it seems that people are still symbolically linked to local and national identity. Therefore, it is important to draw public policies to strengthen our cultural expressions and help us discover our local essence and differentiating elements from others. I always highlight the idea of giving value to our identity within our working team. By nature, the processes of identity are dynamic, which is why we focus on the recognition and promotion of those aspects of our identity, especially affective symbolic aspects that are part of our territories. For example, we highlight and recognized the work of important artists and intellectuals, tradition bearers, cultural institutions and those cities that have been declared a “Cultural City". Our effort is aimed at those seeking shared and symbolic representations that are embodied in individuals, works, and expressions of our culture. Moreover, we have started promoting “rescue work" and value of identity elements, as in the case of expressions of Dominican folklore such as dance and chants, strengthening them through funding, support for dissemination, and preservation thereof. As part of the National Call for Projects, we are supporting the initiatives of multiple groups from various regions of the country. In short, the differentiating elements of Dominican identity are given by the mixture of the manifestations of ethnic groups that are the origin of our people and are expressed in a different form in each region and community of the Dominican territory.</p><h4>What mechanisms have been activated by the Ministry to protect and preserve the tangible and intangible cultural heritage of the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>Among the initiatives to strengthen the cultural institutions in our country, we created the National Culture System, aiming at the decentralization of the state's cultural activities. This process requires efforts at both the central and local government level. The Ministry of Culture has worked on the formation of the Provincial Councils of Culture and the implementation of the National Call for Projects, seeking participation and democratization of cultural resources. These actions have enabled us to directly link authorities with cultural managers, boosting the participation of local governments. Similarly, we work to protect and preserve the tangible and intangible cultural heritage, and right now we are in the process of reviewing current cultural legislation, while promoting a draft law on the Protection, Safeguarding and Promotion of Dominican Cultural Heritage. We also work on an official certificate for the export of local crafts and visual arts and the revision of the National Network of Museums. We have included Cultural Heritage as one of the axes of funding in the National Call for Cultural Projects and we aim at reintroducing a draft law on crafts. Currently, the Ministry of Culture has been involved in a program to strengthen national capacities for the Intangible Cultural Heritage through workshops sponsored by UNESCO and we are set to launch a new website on Dominican World Heritage. Finally, we have a cooperation agreement on Risk Management of Colonial Cities and Museums with the Ministry of Armed Forces for the Protection, Safeguarding and Development of Dominican Cultural Heritage.</p><h4>What measures does the Ministry implement to create further synergies between culture and education and culture and economy as key factors for development?</h4><p>Since our arrival at the Ministry, and following the guidelines set by President Medina, we have implemented a series of measures to establish strategic alliances for the success of cultural and educational management. We have already submitted to the Ministry of Education a portfolio of projects to be developed, and we are in talks to establish a new interagency agreement for the development of arts education. Regarding economics, we are set to create a specialized agency for the promotion of the cultural and creative industries, which will direct cultural policies for this sector. We also work on determining the real impact of cultural activity in the national economy. Finally, the Department of Education and Training attached to the Vice Ministry created in coordination with the Latin American Faculty of Social Sciences (FLACSO-RD) the first Diploma in Management of Cultural and Creative Industries; 40 managers and entrepreneurs have already graduated from this program. We also have a Department of Cultural Commerce, which is providing advice and consulting services in the marketing of services and cultural goods.</p><div class="quote">“  We have implemented a series of measures to establish strategic alliances for the success of cultural and educational management. "</div><h4>The country has become a member of the Executive Board of UNESCO for 2013-2017. What are the reasons that drove your candidacy?</h4><p>To become a member of the Executive Board of UNESCO and President of the Council is a great honor for our country, and it means that the Dominican Republic will be a key player in the definition of the strategy and projects of this international organization, recognizing also the country's competencies and contributions to areas such as education, science, culture and communication. We aim at opening a common space for cooperation with UNESCO and its members, strengthening South-South and North-South-North cooperation with our country. In 2014, the Dominican Republic has the Pro Tempore Presidency of the Forum of Ministers of Culture and Education of the Central American Integration System and UNESCO's position will also serve to ensure regional representation.</p><h4>How relevant is the UNESCO Juan Bosch Award for Social Science Research in further promoting research in the country?</h4><p>Social sciences and research, as a means  implement public policies in the areas of competence of UNESCO, have received a special mention and boost at the public level. In the last edition, a Colombian woman who presented a paper on youth violence in Guatemala was awarded the prize. These investigations made by young people clearly promote research, enhancing public policies of UNESCO members. In addition, it is a high honor for the Dominican Republic that this cathedra was named after the famous Dominican scholar Juan Bosch, an international recognition of his work.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In 2012, you celebrated the 20th anniversary of relations between Kazakhstan and Latvia. What is the importance of this relationship?<br></h4><p>The countries share a close link dating back to Soviet times. Kazakhstan, today, marks a new step in our global development activities, particularly to the backdrop of a growing China and Central Asia. We see Kazakhstan as an important counterpart in our future activities. For Latvia, transit remains an essential consideration, particularly as we boast ice-free ports of large, underutilized capacity. We see similar growth and development in Kazakhstan, and also in other former Soviet countries, including Russia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. They all share our desire to remain fully independent states that enjoy secure and friendly relations with their neighbors. This is an excellent basis on which to expand our current activities, as well as seek out fresh opportunities, particularly in the field of education, and the exchange of our experience of becoming members of the EU, NATO, and various other international organizations.</p><h4>In 2014, President Nazarbayev revealed a desire to increase the trade volume between Kazakhstan and Latvia from $350 million to $500 million. How can this be achieved?</h4><p>During my recent visit to Kazakhstan, we were accompanied by a large delegation of entrepreneurs, and not only business people, but also many university rectors and heads of cultural institutions. Culture and education are key fields for future development. Latvia has a strong tradition of musical education starting from kindergarten, and the country boasts a myriad of opera singers and conductors working around the world. We view this as a very important field for expansion. In terms of education, we are heading in new directions in developmental terms, and Kazakhstan has enormous experience in that respect. We also have some highly developed branches of education, and such exchange is crucial. Including the industrial aspect, every part of the trip proved highly successful. Meeting with President Nazarbayev was particularly informative, and we found the country fascinating. Our two nations share a firm mutual understanding and vision for the future. Life is not just a question of trade and industry, and we are eager to create bonds in all fields, particularly by strengthening relationships in areas where we may have differences. If there was one positive aspect of the Soviet era, it was an emphasis on the cultural development of the individual, and we feel we can build on this ideal.</p><h4>How does cooperation in the Baltic benefit the region?</h4><p>Some projects are already underway, an example being a grand terminal that, once built, will be very important for Kazakhstan. All transit-related infrastructure is positive. In terms of utilizing railways, both countries are actively exchanging views and trying to take practical steps to grow. We have to maintain more terminals, but we also have to foster practical links with Kazakhstan and with all countries interested in entering the European markets.</p><h4>In 2015, Latvia will preside over the Council of the EU. What goals do you hope to achieve during that time?</h4><p>We want to attach significance to develop ties with countries such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, and Turkmenistan. This is tied to the EU's long-term goals, including the finalization of activities in Afghanistan and assisting it in changing its distribution model from a martial to a commercial one. In that respect, Kazakhstan, as well as countries like Turkmenistan, are playing an important role. We have created the necessary basis for progress, and it will now take dedication from both sides over time. We have excellent personal relations on all levels, and we have opened up real opportunities, which is a solid basis for the future.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>We last spoke with you for our 2012 edition. How has AmCham's role and membership changed and developed since then?<br></h4><p>As far as our role is concerned, we have worked hard on advocacy for our members. Our ability to advocate strongly is continuously evolving, as is our relationship with senior levels of the government of Kazakhstan. We aim to work closely with the government, mainly through our regular meetings with the Prime Minister and cabinet ministers, to express our opinions and our members' opinions. We also coordinate, cooperate, and are supportive of government initiatives such as the green economy and healthcare reform, working together with the ministers responsible for these initiatives. AmCham's membership also changes from year to year. This is a healthy phenomenon, and something we work at to achieve. There are always new members joining, while others may be leaving the country or downsizing. The membership now consists primarily of large companies; however, with a healthy mixture of SMEs. This reflects the current situation in Kazakhstan, as it is difficult for entrepreneurial start-ups and small companies to operate, and many do not last long. Larger companies inevitably have greater experience and resources, and many have operated in Russia and Ukraine or elsewhere in the CIS. This enables them to successfully navigate the difficulties common to this region. The government has set the goal of economic diversification, aiming to promote and support entrepreneurship, but the business environment is still extremely difficult for small businesses.</p><h4>What do you think needs to be done to make the environment more inviting for smaller businesses?</h4><p>There needs to be a realistic effort to open up the business environment for small companies, to encourage fresh ideas and innovative approaches, and to fill niches presently unoccupied. Instead, a lot of pressure is brought to bear from the tax authorities and financial regulation. Corruption and bribery is also a continuing problem. Small companies find it difficult to fight corruption since they don't have teams of lawyers or deep pockets to sustain battles against bureaucracy and the courts. This is not a problem only for SMEs, but also for the larger companies that feel struggles of this nature distract them from their priority to build a healthy business. As for tax disputes, these are common in the corporate environment of many countries, but they are dealt with differently here. In Kazakhstan, such disputes are criminalized very quickly. The accepted practice in developed countries is to negotiate to resolve such disputes. Kazakhstan should adopt this approach, which would save time in finding an equitable solution without resorting to the criminal courts.</p><h4>What action has the government taken to improve the business environment?</h4><p>The government speaks a great deal about improving the business environment, but change is slow to come. A major plus is that corporate taxes are decreasing year by year, but legal and judicial reform has not progressed sufficiently and labor legislation, particularly relating to visas and work permits for foreign staff at foreign companies, creates major difficulties. Local content, meaning services, supplies, and staffing, is being pushed hard. The intention is to promote local businesses and to increase local employment, but quality and expertise are not always at the desired level. Of course, foreign companies would be more than willing to source their supplies and services from local suppliers, because it would entail significant savings. However, sectors requiring a high level of technological or other expertise, such as the oil industry, require top-quality equipment and services. They cannot operate otherwise. These companies have asked the government for more time to allow local companies to meet international standards and to train the specialized engineers needed for these industries. Another point of concern is the recent formation of the National Chamber of Entrepreneurs, created by the government last summer and entailing mandatory membership for all businesses, large and small, foreign and domestic, operating in Kazakhstan. This will create a chamber with over 1 million members. The largest members, defined as those with revenue of over $20 million per year, a modest threshold for a company that will encompass many AmCham members, will be required to pay annual membership fees of $50,000. The stated intention is to support small businesses; however, it is not clear how this will be done. The chamber also has a quasi-political structure that appears more of a step back into the past than forward into the future. It remains to be seen what will come of this new government initiative, which will fully enter into force in 2015.</p><div class="quote">“  AmCham grows year by year at an average rate of 20%. "</div><h4>AmCham works closely with the government via the Prime Minister's Council to Improve the Investment Climate, a body created specifically for AmCham as the leading foreign investors' business association in Kazakhstan. How has this partnership contributed to a more enticing environment for investors?</h4><p>The Prime Minister's Council is a unique creation by the government and a great platform for dialogue between senior government policymakers and the business community. With regard to ongoing investor issues such as taxes, legal problems, and environmental and labor issues, we have brought up all of those subjects and begun serious debate on them. Each meeting consists of presentations by leading AmCham member companies, the five ambassadors from the US, the UK, the EU, Canada, and Switzerland, who are also part of the Council, and the ministers who are invited to attend the Council when a topic falling into their area of responsibility is up for discussion. There are many talented policymakers in the government; however, progress is sometimes slow. Compared to other countries in the region, Kazakhstan is an excellent model for development, and this openness to dialogue is one of the country's most attractive characteristics. Foreign businesses that have been operating elsewhere in the CIS for a decade or more say it is easier here, and that Kazakhstan has a more open business environment, despite being a smaller market compared to Russia, for example.</p><h4>AmCham held the Economic Policy Forum on Healthcare Reform in 2013. What opportunities are open to foreign investors in this sector?</h4><p>Healthcare is a priority area for development in Kazakhstan, and business can play a positive role in this. Updated medical schools and medical education is very much needed, but technology, management expertise, public health strategies involving new taxation approaches, and legal reform to rethink the responsibility of healthcare to the public and to private healthcare institutions are all needed. Kazakhstan inherited a Soviet health system that fell into decay. The government now devotes significant resources to improve and refashion healthcare, but this is a sensitive area that is a work in progress. Most people here, if they can afford it, still go abroad for medical treatment. This needs to be rectified, and the business community can help. The AmCham healthcare sector of the membership has grown significantly in the past few years, and many companies that had not previously considered health a growth industry have now prioritized it for the years ahead.</p><h4>What does the future hold for AmCham?</h4><p>AmCham grows year by year at an average rate of 20%, and our membership diversity continues to increase. I am personally quite internationally attuned, so I constantly look for countries and companies not currently represented by AmCham. I would love for it to become a UN of businesses. In addition to our traditional North American and European membership, I am glad to see that the Asia Pacific is growing, and by that I do not mean just China, but also the presence of companies from Japan, Korea, and Australia, plus firms from the UAE and many Turkish companies. It is a good mixture, and we find that we are all on the same wavelength when it comes to the issues that are of concern to us.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you think public-private partnerships (PPPs) will be used to further leverage the advantage of the country?<br></h4><p>There are two reasons to undertake PPPs, for example projects based on PPP: first, to supplement fiscal budgets and, second, to improve the delivery of public services. Kazakhstan epitomizes the need for PPPs. It is a vast, landlocked country, and faces challenges related to insufficient and aging infrastructure. Given its vastness and need for connectivity, it requires new and better infrastructure, including roads, railways, airports, airlines, power, and gas distribution networks. This requires a lot of money. So far, the infrastructure has been funded and provided by the government or public agencies. They all face fiscal constraints. Thus, PPPs should be seen not as a replacement or substitute for the government, but as an off-balance sheet tool to increase investments in infrastructure and other areas of interest. The second important reason, sometimes considered even more important than the first, is to improve the quality and efficiency of public services. That means that PPPs allow a country to not only improve the quality of public services, but also to build these services in the first place. Well-structured PPP projects not only help rationalize project costs, but they also help reduce project completion times. PPPs are a great mechanism to avoid the building of white elephants, since private sector investors seek a return on their capital. This is why nearly every country in today's world has some sort of a PPP program, including Kazakhstan.</p><h4>The IFC is advising on corporate governance. How would you rate the enforcement of sound corporate governance locally?</h4><p>The IFC is committed to improving corporate governance as a way of promoting sustainable private sector investment and strengthening capital markets in emerging markets. We see that corporate governance development is a pressing issue for Kazakhstani companies due to many factors, including the intention of companies to go public, attract domestic and foreign investment, and enhance operational efficiency and image. The outlook for corporate governance standards implementation could be considered positive because both the government and the business community recognize the necessity for improving corporate governance practices in Kazakhstan. The IFC is a recognized global leader in the promotion of corporate governance standards and has developed a globally respected and well-tested methodology for evaluating corporate governance practices, risks, and opportunities. In Kazakhstan, the IFC, together with its two partners, offers corporate governance services for companies and financial institutions, including thematic training, tailored diagnostic reviews, consultations on specific corporate governance matters, and in-depth assessments with implementation plans.</p><h4>Kazakhstan's banking sector is stable, but there are issues with 30% of the loan book. What needs to be done to overcome this challenge?</h4><p>A well-functioning financial sector and improved access to finance remains an important element of the growth and diversification agenda. Improved access to finance is essential for the growth of the non-oil sector in line with the government of Kazakhstan's efforts on diversification. The government has done a number of things to restore the health of the banking sector. It has recently announced the privatization of the banks that needed to be rescued during the financial crisis. A new legal framework governing bankruptcy and insolvency is also being developed to address problems of highly indebted firms—an essential foundation for the resolution of NPLs. Efforts are needed to ensure proper loan valuation and provisioning, and decisive actions are required to reduce bad loans and replenish bank capital where needed.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will the Cooperation Council of Turkic Speaking States (CCTS) further improve cooperation between Kazakhstan and other member states?<br></h4><p>The key agenda of the CCTS is economic cooperation as a locomotive for cooperation in other areas, and was the topic of the first summit, held on October 21, 2011 in Almaty. Upon the instructions issued by the respective heads of state, ministers and heads of diverse government authorities began to meet annually to discuss how to improve further collaboration. Under the CCTS initiative, economy ministers met in Astana in 2011. The ministers immediately established an operational mechanism—working groups in economic cooperation—with the aim of overcoming current obstacles in our economic relations and expanding through tangible projects with the participation of private-sector representatives. During the Almaty summit, the Turkic Business Council was established as the primary instrument for private sector cooperation among member states' businesses, providing an institutional forum for discussion and the promotion of common activities. At the Bishkek summit, held in August 2012, the presidents of member states emphasized the importance of cooperation in transportation, and instructed the ministers of transportation and customs authorities to meet and discuss issues of interest, mainly the extension of the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway route across the Caspian Sea by ferry and via Kazakhstan to China. Meanwhile, tourism ministers for the first time decided to gather in Turkey in April 2014. There are also complementary organizations to the CCTS, such as the Turkic Academy located in Astana that will study Turkic history and language, and the Turkic Culture and Heritage Foundation based in Baku, which will focus on the preservation and development of cultural heritage across Turkic states. The CCTS operates as an umbrella organization for all other institutions such as Parliamentary Assembly of Turkic-Speaking Countries (TURKPA), International Organization of Turkic Culture (TURKSOY), and the Turkic Business Council.</p><h4>How do you see the transport and logistics sector evolving in the medium term, and how will these projects benefit Kazakhstan's economy?</h4><p>Kazakhstan is developing essential national programs and has a clear strategy on transport and logistics expansion. In that respect, the CCTS supports the realization of the Silk Wind project, which aims to construct a high-speed, multimodal container transportation system for freight shipments between the countries of Europe, the Caucasus, and Asia. The integration of this project into CCTS transport projects is already underway and is on the agenda of the CCTS' ministers of transportation. Indeed, the investment in land routes will be beneficial for passenger mobility and trade within the country itself. One of the conclusions reached at the World Economic Forum on Europe and Central Asia organized in Vienna in June 2011 was that opening a land route connecting the Pacific, China, and East Asia with Western Europe—the Silk Road—promises to cut transport times to less than one-quarter of their current stretch. Some countries along the route could increase their GDP by more than 40% as a result of increased business and services. The Silk Road used to be the Turkic Road, and it is essential that its restoration will serve the interests of our countries and regions, as well as rest of the world.</p><h4>How will the CCTS support Kazakhstan in pursuing its Strategy-2050 goals?</h4><p>Under the leadership of President Nursultan Nazarbayev, Kazakhstan has made tremendous achievements over the past 20 years. The Kazakhstan 2050 strategy covers ambitious plans and challenging tasks. But because of its achievements, the international community acknowledges Kazakhstan as an equal and reliable partner. Now, President Nazarbayev is setting a modernized political course for Kazakhstan in the 21st century that addresses the need to develop a modern transport and logistics infrastructure to boost economic growth, as well as international and domestic integration.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Over the next 18 months, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) intends to invest over $1 billion in Kazakhstan. What are its main investment priorities?<br></h4><p>There are three basic areas that we will be focusing on in Kazakhstan. One is diversification in support of the non-resources sectors; we are already the largest investor in this area and will continue to support it through financing projects that enhance corporate sector productivity, in particular those that improve the business environment, modernization in the agro-business sector and the entire value chain, and that facilitate growth in the SME sector. We will also work intensively with the banking and non-banking financial sectors, particularly with micro-credit and SMEs. The second pivot of the strategy is balancing the role of the state and the market by supporting the growth of private enterprises. We will also be working with public enterprises to help commercialize them, boost efficiency, and bring the private sector into what was state dominated, primarily through policy instruments like public-private partnerships (PPPs) and fair and transparent procurement policies. The third pivot of our strategy is the green economy, through the promotion of low carbon growth and energy efficiency. We worked closely with the government of Kazakhstan and the Ministry of Environment and Water to put in place the new energy strategy, and we will be supporting this as the top priority through projects in energy renewables, agriculture waste, waste management, transport, and other sectors.</p><h4>In which non-energy sectors do you see the greatest opportunities for foreign investment?</h4><p>I would say the infrastructure sector because of the massive size of the country. There are huge road projects underway. The EBRD has financed a portion of the Shymkent-Tashkent road, which is part of the West China-to-West Europe project. In terms of airlines, I believe there is room for a regional firm to complement Air Astana on routes that airlines do not cover. There are huge opportunities in the agribusiness sector, too, that I think have not yet been fully exploited. In the southern part of the country, there have been quite a few agricultural missions from Western Europe related to irrigation systems, green houses, and other projects. In terms of manufacturing, the key for Kazakhstan will be the ability to open up the market to surrounding countries; Kazakhstan has just 17 million people, but if you start to include countries like Uzbekistan and the surrounding Central Asian countries into its market dynamics, then you have a much broader base for production.</p><h4>What steps need to be taken to make Kazakhstan's capital markets more attractive?</h4><p>The first thing needed is trust amongst the banks. Right now, there is a real problem in terms of tenge liquidity, rendering medium- or long-term borrowing difficult, and of course the successful growth of SMEs requires longer-term funding available to finance investments. First of all, by cleaning up the banking sphere, the banks will establish trust amongst themselves, enabling the healthy growth of a real money market among the banks. Then, the ability of companies to raise funds in tenge is absolutely critical. What we are finding now is that many companies are primarily borrowing in US dollars, which is unsustainable in the long term due to exchange rate risks.</p><h4>What opportunities are there for private investment in Kazakhstan's regions?</h4><p>Places such as Shymkent are growing rapidly—there are around 1 million people in the city and the surrounding areas. Were you to open up border controls and make import/export to Central Asia easier, I think there would be even more growth in the Shymkent area.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does Parasat pair up with research institutions and universities?<br></h4><p>We are working on several projects with the Center of Earth Sciences, Metallurgy, and Ore Benefication. One of our priorities is to commercialize scientific research, an example being a patent for silica production for the metallurgy industry that curbs costs. Silicon is the future of the high-tech industry, although in the distant future it will possibly be replaced by alternative materials. Today, silica is used in solar panels and diodes. There are three silicon-producing plants in Kazakhstan; however, they are not profitable due to being unable to compete with the lower prices offered by Chinese producers. To make Kazakhstani silicon more competitive, our scientists have developed a technology that uses a carbon reductant for silicon production. It is scheduled to launch in summer 2014, and industrial enterprises will be able to examine production and technological sustainability. So far, we have made an investment of around $3 million.</p><h4>What does innovation and change mean for Parasat?</h4><p>The projects and programs that we run are innovative, because they are grounded in new scientific findings and patents. The plan is to establish a knowledge-based economy, and we, therefore, need to reshape the economy toward innovation over the coming years. At Parasat, we promote promising technologies that will have a synergistic effect on the economy. Kazakhstan is a resource-rich country, with oil and gas, as well as rare earth metals. The resource-based economy is a solid foundation for a future innovation paradigm. A high-tech economy requires the refining of raw materials, such as producing petrochemicals instead of selling crude oil and gas. The future of high technologies lies in rare earth materials, and Kazakhstan is among the few countries to have the resources to merit production. The Institute of Physics and Technology possesses the technological infrastructure required for rare metals-based solid fuel production.</p><h4>How will Parasat and technological development boost Kazakhstan's economy in the future?</h4><p>There is a project on diode production, for example, at the Astana Industrial Park, a special zone offering tax and customs preferences. There was a group of young entrepreneurs who wanted to set up diode production and sought out our assistance. Diode lighting saves energy and is better for your eyes, and we are now working in partnership with SEMI LED, based in the US and South Korea, to purchase diode-producing equipment. The Institute of Physics and Technology there has elaborated the production plan. Kazakhstan's economy is based on the mining and metallurgical industry, primarily on rare earth metals. As such, it is necessary to use this mineral potential wisely. Kazakhstan also has a strong and dynamic agricultural sector, meaning there is great potential for developing new technologies in this field. There are certain plants and herbs in Kazakhstan that can be used to produce pharmaceuticals. Phytochem Holding (a component of Parasat Holding) produces mainly natural medicine with limited side effects. The Kazakhstani economy will continue to grow by also taking into account traditional industries. In the future, Kazakhstan will have a self-sufficient space industry, which has already taken off with the Baikonur project. Another area of growth is transport and logistics. Kazakhstan ranks as the ninth largest country in the world in terms of territory. The country can benefit from its position between China and Europe. Currently, it takes 45 days to ship the goods from China to Europe. There is a new railroad under construction, and China is interested in constructing a new canal to speed up the delivery of goods. In addition, a new channel to connect the Caspian and Black seas is under consideration with a capacity of 65 million tons per annum. There is also an affiliated company that produces pharmaceuticals in Ust-Kamenogorsk (Eastern Kazakhstan).</p>]]></richbody0content>

Kazakhstan, under President Nazarbayev, dismantled its nuclear weapons and shifted its focus to the education, welfare, and prosperity of its citizens.</p><h4>Kazakhstan stands as one of Israel's main economic partners in Central Asia, and trade turnover between the two nations amounted at approximately $1.5 billion in 2012. What is at the core of the strong economic ties between Kazakhstan and Israel, and which segments hold the most potential for future developments?</h4><p>Kazakhstan is Israel's major economic partner in Central Asia, and our two countries are committed to further developing these relations. In the last 20 years, we have formed many joint economic ventures such as the Israel-Kazakhstan economic conference, trade centers, and exchanges of know-how between our experts in many fields such as agriculture, energy, and innovation. Though our cooperation has flourished over the years, there remains great potential for growth in the economic relations between us, a development that would benefit both Israel and Kazakhstan. The main source of potential is science and technology. Today, the global economy is based on innovation, and Israel has much experience in this field. We came to a small and unforgiving land, with little water and no natural resources. Our survival was dependent on creativity, innovation, and science. Today, we gladly share our experience with our friends across the world, including Kazakhstan.</p><h4>In 2014, Israeli defense minister Moshe Ya'alon and his Kazakhstani counterpart, Adilbek Dzhaksybekov, signed a defense cooperation agreement between the two countries. What are the prospects of future bilateral cooperation in the areas of defense and technology between Kazakhstan and Israel?</h4><p>There is tremendous potential for strategic cooperation between our countries. Kazakhstan is a key partner in preserving regional peace, stability, and security. The major threat to the world is terrorism. Terrorism today is global; no country can fight it alone. Terror knows no borders, and respects no laws. It affects us all, and we must all unite in the fight against it.</p><h4>What is your outlook on the future of ties between the two countries?</h4><p>We live in a world where geographical distance no longer matters. Israel and Kazakhstan can be neighbors despite not sharing a physical border. Furthermore, we welcome visitors from Kazakhstan to Israel and believe that they will find here a place both rich in history and flourishing with modernity.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Port of Salalah has been ranked among the world's top container ports. What factors are at the root of that constant growth?</h4><p>There are a number of factors that come together for the Salalah growth story, and the factors that propelled the port's growth over 15 years ago cannot be the same going forward. Our strengths will need to continuously change and mature with the times. Nonetheless, at the core here is location and connectivity. The Port of Salalah runs the lion's share of container services calling at Omani ports, and connectivity is always integral for customers and cargo owners who are seeking lean supply chain solutions. Shippers can save on costs primarily on the back of Salalah having the least deviation time from the main Asia-Europe trade lane in relation to competing ports in the region. Furthermore, this port was breaking world records in productivity in only its second year of operations, and until today this port ranks the third most productive port in Africa, the Middle East, and Europe. This entails having the resources and the people necessary to keep up productivity. But looking toward the future, Salalah's growth also relies on hinterland connectivity to regional markets and the acceleration of the free zone. Today and for the near term, growth is happening not on the container side but at the general cargo terminal. Specifically, the booming sector has so far been the export of limestone and gypsum mined locally, and that is a major growth area for the next few years.</p><h4>How are you playing into the opportunity to grow your exports?</h4><p>Our key contribution to helping the local economy to grow its exports is first and foremost to ensure the right infrastructure is in place to support volumes and growing volumes. To that end, we have built four new berths that are designed with specific handling capabilities for liquid, bulk, and aggregate cargo. The capacity that we are creating now should enable us to cope with the growth in that market for the next 10 years or so.</p><div class="quote">“Our key contribution to helping the local economy to grow its exports is to ensure the right infrastructure is in place."</div><h4>How do you differentiate from the ports of Sohar and Duqm?</h4><p>In the past few years since Sohar's inception, Sohar has been primarily involved in general cargo imports and exports for the country, while Salalah has focused on the container transshipment business. As time goes on, Sohar's share of container cargo will increase, while at the same time our general cargo capabilities and volumes will rise. Eventually we will be good at doing similar services but from different locations, and at that point we really need to differentiate our offerings based on the services, natural resources, and markets each port connects to. That is what we are working toward alongside the government and other Omani ports so that we ensure we are not competing but complementing our unique growth stories. Oman needs for all of its ports to be connected in order for its national economy to grow. As we are talking about containers, Salalah needs to move away from the purely transshipment business and shift toward more import and export, which is referred to in the industry as a gateway. I think that the most exciting development that will enable Salalah to grow its domestic cargo share is the railway. In fact, some people are talking about starting it from Salalah because 40% of the cost of the railway line within Oman is the section between Thumrait and Salalah. If we can improve the transport links from Salalah to the rest of the Gulf region through the railway and maybe some investment in the roads, it gives Oman a great opportunity. If a shipping line can avoid going through the Strait of Hormuz into the Gulf, there are a lot of savings to be had, but the only thing that stops them from doing that now is the lack of infrastructure to feed the cargo. So, in my opinion, starting the railway infrastructure from Salalah would be the best thing that could happen for Oman.</p><h4>How long do you think it will take for government officials to see that as well?</h4><p>We are talking about it as often as we can, to as many people as we can. I believe we already won the discussion about whether the railway line needs to come to Salalah, as the cargo is already there for the trains to carry.</p><h4>How would you assess the potential of the port as cruise terminal?</h4><p>The basic infrastructure to support a good cruise terminal and a good cruise destination is already here; it just needs promotion and organization. Together with the Ministry of Tourism we are doing just that. We are investing in a new tourism center specifically for cruise vessels which will be located at the port. But we also need the rest of the tourism sector to realize that there are other things for tourists to do when they get to Salalah because it is just fantastic during the Kharif season. Still, we need to extend the tourism season throughout the rest of the year, and the port will do whatever it can to assist in that. The cruise offering in the past was not particularly good, but now we have a far stronger offering. It is still in its early days, but I think for Salalah it is probably a quick win; the more cruise vessels we can get here, then the more tourism we can get into the town, and the more money generated for the local economy. That would also boost SMEs and extend the tourism season outside the current two months. We need to do more in terms of people and we need to have the right people from our organization promoting tourism. There is a plan to build a new breakwater in Salalah that will have a cruise terminal on it, and we are still in the breakwater design stage. The primary reason for the breakwater is to protect our quays from the weather during the Kharif monsoon season. There is a phenomenon called “long waves," which impacts the port's safety and productivity, so having a breakwater for our existing business is vital.</p><h4>What is the port's current Omanization rate and what are the challenges?</h4><p>The rate is around 60%, so it is relatively high. There are two or three grades of job that are mostly manual labor, which are performed by expatriates, but most of our crane driver jobs are performed by Omanis. The main challenge is to encourage Omanis to do jobs that are not managerial. For us to achieve 100% Omanization, we need Omanis to realize that there are a lot of jobs available, which, despite appearing less attractive, provide an opportunity to grow within the port. It is not easy, and not everyone is going to move from being a vessel lasher to be a crane driver, but they are well-paid and long-lasting jobs as the port is going to be there for a long time.</p><h4>What are your priorities for 2015 and where do you see the port in 10 years?</h4><p>My number one priority at the moment is to try to find ways to mitigate the Kharif challenges, and that is to some extent possible via technology and better ways to moor a ship. The long-term priority for the port is the breakwater, and that is the 10-year aim. We also need to promote Salalah as a gateway port; a gateway to Oman and the Gulf region, rather than just a hub or a transshipment port. That is the objective for the next 10 or even 20 years.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The growth of the aviation industry is one of the many positive changes taking place in Saudi Arabia, and the General Authority of Civil Aviation (GACA) plays a major role in this sector's development. What does GACA expect to achieve from the transformation process now being carried out in this sector?</h4><p>In November 2011, a number of Royal Resolutions were issued calling for the separation of GACA from the Ministry of Defense and Aviation and directly linking it to the Council of Ministers. These resolutions really constituted an important turning point in the history of Saudi Arabia's civil aviation sector, due to the great momentum and independence they have given the sector to enable it to accomplish more progress and prosperity in the country's air transport industry. This industry is no doubt one of the major economic drivers capable of attracting capital and investments, and it employs thousands of people both directly and indirectly, besides its great contribution to the development of many Saudi cities and villages. In December 2012, the Council of Ministers issued a resolution approving “The Comprehensive Strategic Plan for the Advancement of the Civil Aviation Industry in Saudi Arabia." The strategic plan can be summarized in the following way: the resolution seeks to raise the sector's efficiency, and enable it to play its role using modern standards; it seeks to expand national and international private sector participation through well-planned strategic programs; it will maintain international safety and security standards and raise the aviation sector's contribution to the Saudi economy from SAR30 billion to SAR100 billion a year; it will help cope with the developments taking place in the regional and international civil aviation industry; and it will help exercise and organize the powers and functions specified in the Civil Aviation Regulations. Moreover, the resolution will also help assure a sufficient number of flights are provided, to meet the increasing demand for travel, by granting more licenses and incentives to air carriers for serving domestic airports. It will also improve GACA's organizational chart and financial system, while expanding and upgrading airport infrastructure and the air navigation system. Finally, the plan will help develop the necessary legislation for liberating the civil aviation sector, and separate the legislative and monitoring aspects from operational functions. Saudi Arabia's civil aviation sector has the necessary resources to play an important role as a kind of “air bridge" between eastern and western countries, and attract international air traffic to Saudi airspace and airports, as well as huge investments. These specific resources include: Saudi Arabia's religious status, its distinctive strategic geographical location, various aspects of its political and security stability, having an airport network composed of 27 airports well distributed in the different parts of the country supported by integrated navigational systems. We also have significant economic, financial, and oil power, as well as our ambitious development plans, and important tourist attractions. In view of the aforementioned, we can confidently say that Saudi Arabia's civil aviation sector has a promising and bright future.</p><h4>In 2007 GACA opened the door for privatization in some of its sectors, and in 2012 it granted domestic and international air carrier licenses to Al Maha Airways and SaudiGulf Airlines. How can GACA's legislation encourage competitors to enter the Saudi market?</h4><p>GACA has granted a scheduled national air carrier license to SaudiGulf Airlines in which Gulf Air acts as a technical partner, but the airline's capital is 100% Saudi. The second license was granted to Al Maha Airways, which is a Saudi airline independent from Qatar Airways. As for GACA's initiatives to encourage airlines to enter the Saudi market, GACA has prepared a Domestic Fares Manual, which was approved by the GACA Board of Directors and is expected to contribute to the increase in the number of domestic flights. Under the existing guidelines featuring low domestic fares and other aviation charges, which have been applicable for quite a long time now, no airline will be able to operate profitably. A committee was formed by GACA and other concerned authorities to study the reduction of fuel prices in the Saudi airports, and the committee's recommendations were submitted to the supreme authorities.</p><div class="quote">“We can confidently say that Saudi Arabia's civil aviation sector has a promising and bright future"</div><h4>Saudi Arabia invests huge funds in its civil aviation infrastructure; how will this affect the Saudi aviation industry?</h4><p>Saudi Arabia's aviation industry is considered one of the central industries, which contributes considerably to the progress of socioeconomic development in this vast country. As this industry is currently witnessing great developments, at the international level, in all aspects, GACA has made provisions in its future plans for coping with these developments and opening new horizons for dealing with changes in the industry, to enable the first beneficiary (the passenger) to have better services. No doubt GACA's airport infrastructure has received a major portion of these efforts; for example, SAR27 billion was allocated to the New King Abdulaziz International Airport (KAIA) construction project and around SAR2.5 billion to the upgrading of a number of domestic airports.</p><h4>To what extent does Your Highness believe that the private sector's contribution will benefit Saudi Arabia's industry?</h4><p>The execution of development and expansion works in Saudi Arabia was no longer the sole responsibility of the public sector; the private sector has now become a partner in sharing this responsibility. Recognizing the importance of the new partnership between the two sectors, GACA has succeeded in making the private sector a main partner in the industry's development by providing it with all the resources it needs, and eliminating all the obstacles facing it. For example, the Prince Mohammed Bin Abdulaziz International Airport Construction and Development Project in Medina was awarded to a consortium of companies composed of both international and Saudi interests through the BTO system. The new KAIA operation will be awarded to the private sector through one of the public-private partnership (PPP) systems, and Taif's new airport is also expected to be awarded to the private sector. This trend arises directly from our belief in the importance of the private sector's role based on the sector's many successful experiences in the construction and operation of international airports.</p><h4>GACA issued a second public offering of sukuk in 2013. Does it plan to rely on the capital market in the future for funding?</h4><p>GACA has all the necessary flexibility for choosing the appropriate system for financing its projects. This depends in the first place on the projects' nature and feasibility, and that will definitely not be limited to sukuk alone.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the Dominican Republic's potential as a hub in the Caribbean, and how do your operations affect the region at large?<br></h4><p>We are developing a logistics free zone in Puerto Caucedo to work toward that very purpose. I am positive about the country's potential in this field. The Dominican Republic has the important ingredient of local cargo, which you need to include in order to be profitable. We also provide services for transshipment to other destinations, since the Dominican Republic is the largest market for local cargo within the Caribbean. We are a strong hub for transshipments to smaller countries and ports within the area.</p><h4>What is your vision for the development strategy of Maritima Dominicana?</h4><p>Our goal is to become a service provider for what we call supply chain management; in other words, we want global companies to use the Dominican Republic as an inventory hub for spare parts and products that can eventually be delivered to local customers or clients within the region. The services that we provide involve the management of materials and spare parts inventories that can later on be distributed either locally or abroad.</p><h4>How do you adapt to the diverse requirements of your clients?</h4><p>Each has to manage their own inventory and supply to customers via an in-house system. We then become part of that system as we offer a tailor-made provision of services to our clients. We need knowledgeable personnel to manage our IT systems to the high standards and commercial principles that we live by. And over the past five or six years, we have employed and educated many people who today are capable of doing this, and can successfully integrate them into the companies we work for. We have sent employees on training courses in Panama, the US, and even Europe over the past few years precisely to be able to adapt ourselves to the requirements of our clients.</p><div class="quote">“Companies have an excellent opportunity to use the Dominican Republic as a hub. "</div><h4>What kind of infrastructure is needed to provide the various services you offer?</h4><p>In the shipping industry, we have departments that undertake container repair and maintenance at all ports of the Dominican Republic. We are also a service provider of spare parts for companies, such as Thermo King and Carrier, which are the major suppliers of refrigeration systems for most of the world's reefer containers. All global steam ship carriers have reefer containers, but it is impossible to know when they will require repairs to their equipment. Therefore, if we have a local hub here for such spare parts, as well as the ability to provide that service very quickly, this would be an important element of the services that we provide.</p><h4>Do you typically focus on a specific sector or client?</h4><p>We do not focus on one specific sector, as the services we provide are essentially generic; they are not dependent on the companies that require them because containers and reefers are the same, more or less, for all shipping lines. For example, for companies importing or exporting fresh fruits and vegetables, we can store these products in our warehouses and then, according to their requirements, deliver them to their local customers, or to the shipping lines for export.</p><h4>How do your services differ among the various ports of the country?</h4><p>Each port has a specialized service for different cargo. For example, the main container ports are Caucedo and Haina, but some containers are being handled in Puerto Plata. Haina is focused on bulk cargo, like grain, coal, or fertilizers, and general cargo like steel and lumber, while  San Pedro is involved in the export of cement and the import of fertilizers. We are the agents for vessels that deliver or load different cargos depending on the location.</p><h4>How does customs clearance work and how does it benefit the client?</h4><p>It is much easier to handle the transfer of cargo from the port to the customer when all services are combined, including the handling of cargo at the port, customs clearance, local transportation, the management of inventory where necessary, and then final delivery. Therefore, it is a chain of services that can all be integrated to provide the ultimate delivery of that cargo to the customer.</p><h4>How do you service liners?</h4><p>To be a port agent for liner companies is again what we call a generic service; we handle the port agency of the vessel, crew changes, the supply of spare parts or provisions, and supply drinking water or fuel oil. Those generic services really have nothing to do with the customer services that the liner companies provide to their customers. This is why most liner companies today have their own offices to be in contact with the customer. Basically, generic services can be provided to any principal, even if they compete with each other on a regular basis.</p><h4>How does the regulatory environment affect the industry?</h4><p>The legal structure that has to do with customs and the local authorities needs to make this distribution system more efficient. If you want to develop a new market of global commerce, you also have to adapt the local legal structure to make it efficient. That does not mean we will violate any government requirements, but the systems have to be modernized, and this is an issue we are currently discussing with the local authorities. A new customs law is currently under discussion in Congress aimed at rendering those services more efficient.</p><h4>Have single window principles been applied here yet?</h4><p>The idea is there, but has yet to be applied. Companies have an excellent opportunity to use the Dominican Republic as a hub, but you have to be able to bring in spare parts without having to declare them in the local market. They should rest in a free zone and then, when they are needed in the local market, they can be declared, but when you want to send them to Barbados for example, you shouldn't have to pay import taxes on cargo if you are shipping it there. This is one of the issues that the new customs law needs to cover. The same holds true for the export of agricultural products; it has to be coordinated effectively such that when a shipment is delivered to the airport, it does not sit there for hours awaiting  agriculture department inspection. If you miss the connection and need to wait until the next day to ship it, the quality of that product will suffer.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Countries in the Caucasus and Central Asia (CCA) have recorded significant economic achievements since independence. They have grown more rapidly—on average by 7% over 1996—2011—than those in many other regions of the world and poverty has declined. Inflation has come down sharply from high rates in the 1990s and interest rates have fallen. Financial sectors have deepened somewhat, as evidenced by higher deposits and lending. Fiscal policies were broadly successful in building savings prior to the global crisis and those buffers were used effectively by many CCA countries to support growth and protect the most vulnerable as the crisis washed across the region. CCA oil and gas exporters have achieved significant improvements in living standards with the use of their energy wealth.<br></p><p>As a trusted advisor, the IMF regularly consults with country authorities on their economic policies and challenges. In the CCA region, while macroeconomic achievements have been notable, lowering output and inflation volatility and reducing the reliance on energy resources and remittances for growth have been at the core of IMF advice. Moreover, central banks in the region need to gain more independence, to ensure that monetary policy is effective in promoting financial stability. At the same time, the prevalence of dollarization, which reflects weak confidence in many CCA currencies, complicates policy delivery.</p><p>Over the coming decade, CCA countries have the opportunity to boost their economic development and strive to become dynamic emerging markets. This opportunity, provided by strong commodity prices and healthy remittance flows, should help create the macroeconomic space to pursue ambitious policy and structural reforms.</p><p>Kazakhstan embodies many of the region's successes and challenges. Its economic recovery from the global crisis was rapid, with output growth of around 7.5% in 2010-11. Real GDP growth slowed over the last two years, mostly reflecting declines in oil and agricultural output, but was solid at around 5%-6%. External pressures on prices have eased and inflation is now below the authorities' objective range of 6%-8%. However, a persistently large stock of non-performing loans (NPLs)—a legacy of the global crisis—is holding back a meaningful recovery in the health of bank balance sheets.</p><p>The growth outlook is strong. In 2014, we expect real GDP to expand at around 6%, moderately below the growth rate in 2013, reflecting recovery of investment and household demand. Over the medium term, solid growth prospects are driven by oil production, which is expected to increase by a third over the next five years, principally because of the Kashagan oil field. There are some downside risks to the outlook, primarily emanating from the external environment, including from a possible sustained slowdown in Russia and China, regional issues, and lower oil prices.</p><p>In view of limited progress on the resolution of NPLs, a more proactive posture could be useful. Despite the introduction of new measures in 2012, NPLs remain high at around 30%. New ceilings on NPLs (15% in 2014) were a step in the right direction, but require proper enforcement, including through effective supervisory actions. The IMF has been helping through organizing seminars and providing technical assistance, including on international best practice, and further collaboration with the authorities is envisaged in this area.</p><p>The central bank has begun to work on strengthening the monetary policy framework, with particular emphasis on enhancing liquidity management and the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. The prospective introduction of a new benchmark policy interest rate, guided by active open market operations, is indeed welcome. To anchor expectations about policy intentions and operations, the IMF and the authorities have discussed the importance of communicating the transition plans openly, and, once implemented, elaborating on the factors guiding the interest rate decisions in the post-policy meeting communiqué and quarterly inflation reports. Over the medium term, greater exchange rate flexibility will be essential to support a move to inflation targeting, a stated goal by the National Bank. Here too, the IMF stands ready to help the authorities build on lessons learned from the international experience.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[do-you-deliver]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>TBY What can you offer to companies in the Dominican Republic that others cannot?<br></h4><p>I think that the difference between Domex and its competitors is one of approach. We can service each city, town, or province around the Dominican Republic because we have representatives that act as exclusive contractors. They are people who work with us and whom we support with equipment, engines, and vehicles. When we built this network, we adapted and bought all facilities required to be able to deliver anything from a simple letter to a large box. We also created a system that consolidates all documents in one location from where they can be distributed nationwide. We maintain communications with all of our contractors and employees online, which ensures that our clients know the exact moment that their own clients receive their documents via tracking. Today, we move about 5 million items a year in the Dominican Republic.</p><h4>How do you adapt to the needs of diverse clients?</h4><p>Each client has unique requirements, where for example, one may require certain signatures upon receipt. At the same time, the courier may request ID from the recipient to safeguard against error. This is required for documents of high value, such as passports, credit cards, legal documents, and courier packages, for example. When someone only needs evidence of delivery, for example for a magazine, we deliver without requesting ID. Another method involves clients only requiring knowledge of when we have completed distribution. This is common during political campaigns, for example, or for promotions. We deliver these items to every home and building on a specific street. That client won't request evidence of receipt or delivery; they need only know that the document was distributed.</p><h4>What are the company's targets for 2014?</h4><p>Our goal for is to develop a door-to-door delivery service. This will be a first in the Dominican Republic, as currently senders and receivers visit their local agency. This is why eBay and Amazon do not exist here; sellers cannot schedule a door-to-door service, and lack a means of transporting a package to a house. Here lies our future.</p><h4>Why do other companies not provide this?</h4><p>They lack the network it requires. For example, an exclusive service from your representative, requires guarantee volume and income. They do not work for you. That is the difference—making a commitment to your employees, who should be considered a key partner of yours. This philosophy ensures that both parties are happy. Today, the people who carry out international courier services buy their products in the US and send them to us in the Dominican Republic. But now, we are set to help those who want to buy merchandise in the Dominican Republic. We are giving them two options in a service we expect to launch in 2014.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the key measures that Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic have taken to strengthen bilateral ties in fields such as maritime and air transportation?<br></h4><p>Both our countries have enjoyed continued collaboration and cooperation over the past few years. For example, President Medina attended my official inauguration. The ties between our nations are historical, and have transformed over time. During the first half of the 20th century, many Puerto Rican people moved to the Dominican Republic seeking employment. This trend was reversed in the second half of the century due to the evolution and progress of our economy. We have set up joint industrial projects; production plants in the Dominican Republic receiving goods and products that are initially manufactured in our country. Currently, President Medina and I have decided to explore opportunities for both countries and create new synergies to further strengthen our economies in the international arena. Puerto Rico has strong air transport connections with the US, whereas the Dominican Republic enjoys more consolidated air connections with South America. This is something we can both benefit from. Air Europa recently launched a two-flight per week route connecting San Jose with Spain, and we aim to have an extra daily flight connecting us with the Dominican Republic to create even better connections with Europe. On top of that, Lufthansa is set to open a maintenance and repair center for the region in our country. This center will be open to other carriers too, and we are 100% convinced that this will help to create additional synergies between both countries.</p><h4>What is behind Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic's plan to purchase oil together?</h4><p>There have been talks already, but we have agreed on nothing thus far; Puerto Rico has more economic energy costs than the Dominican Republic. The idea would be to make joint purchases of oil, so we can have a stronger position when negotiating. Talks have also addressed the construction of an underwater energy cable to better exchange energy that has already been produced.</p><h4>What other sectors offer the greatest potential to boost bilateral cooperation?</h4><p>Agriculture is one of the main sectors offering bright future prospects to boost commercial ties. Both countries understand this, and have in the past few months taken steps in this field. We are actively increasing the area of farmed land, and value Dominican expertise in several areas. For example, we have started cultivating rice—in 18 months we have gone from 0 acres to more than 600 acres under cultivation. We have also increased sugar cane crops, and plan to reach 20,000 acres in the next few years having started from scratch almost two years ago.</p><div class="quote">“  President Medina and I have decided to explore opportunities for both countries and create new synergies to further strengthen our economies. "</div><h4>Apart from the pharmaceutical industry, what are some of the other strategic sectors your government aims to further develop?</h4><p>We are in the process of diversifying our economy. Agriculture and textile manufacturing have been two traditionally strong sectors in Puerto Rico and we believe we need to revive them. Chemical products and medical devices are two segments with the potential to boost the diversification of our economy. Today, 48% of our economy depends on manufacturing activities and we know that we must diversify this for greater economic success. In this context, we have taken positive steps within the aerospace industry, as exemplified by Lufthansa. These efforts have also enabled us to attract software production activity related to this industry. The main multinationals in this sphere are present in Puerto Rico, which is significant. They create many job opportunities for our people, and fortunately, we have seen a shift toward research and development in our economic activity as a country. Innovation is playing an important role today. The impact of tourism activity in our economy is considerably rising, and the number of tourists is increasing with each passing month. We attract many cruise companies into the country, while over 1,000 additional beds will shortly be included in Puerto Rico's touristic offering. Meanwhile, in terms of security we have reduced crime rates by over 20% since I began my tenure as Governor.</p><h4>What have been your landmark achievements since you took over as Governor of Puerto Rico?</h4><p>Puerto Rico is set to pass its first balanced budget in 22 years, which will enable us to allocate more resources to generate employment opportunities. We are also diversifying our industrial base. We need to transform our agricultural sector to make it more efficient, and also renovate our tourism sector. These elements will enable us to become a more competitive economy in the region and the world.</p><h4>What are the competitive advantages of investing in Puerto Rico?</h4><p>I would sum it up in one statement; all the main multinational pharmaceutical companies have a presence in Puerto Rico, and they are all continuously expanding their activity. The same is true for software developers such as HP, IBM, and Microsoft, and many others that are already operating successfully here. Many airlines and tourism companies have already returned to the country in recent years. Avianca has increased its routes from Puerto Rico from three a week to five, and will soon have daily flights, too.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What underlies the strategic thrust of the key agriculture sectors in expanding their capabilities and successfully adapting them to the changing economic environment?<br></h4><p>The agricultural development program that is running the government of President Danilo Medina seeks to strengthen the food security and nutrition of the population, the expansion of agri-food exports, the alleviation of rural poverty, and the modernization of the sector's public institutions. To achieve these goals, the primary effort has been the provision of credit to finance the production of staple food crops such as rice, beans, onion, garlic, and milk and export crops such as cocoa, bananas, and fresh vegetables. It is also financing the installation greenhouses, vegetables export, and others. Similarly, it has increased funding for the installation of packing and processing plants, which allow not only to add value to production, but also to ensure compliance with the export sanitary and quality standards required by international markets. This funding has been made possible through the Agricultural Bank, the Reserve Bank, private commercial banks, through the release of legal reserves, and the Special Fund for Agricultural Development (FEDA). The result of these sectorial financing programs for the year 2013 it that it is estimated that the agricultural sector will receive credits worth around Ps31 billion pesos.</p><h4>The Ministry manages investments in the form of credit for agricultural production and agricultural insurance, which are often overseen in the field by President Medina himself. What is the scope of these investments and how do they favor the agricultural sector?</h4><p>The heavy investments made in the sector required an agricultural insurance system that safeguards and protects against adverse weather conditions. In this regard, we have implemented the Law 157-09 that creates the agricultural insurance system, which has been provided with an additional Ps150 million in order to provide a subsidy of 50% of the value of the 12 major crops. This process will continue each year to achieve universal insurance use for producers. Without a strong agricultural insurance system it is not possible to promote and protect investments in this sector.</p><h4>How important for the Ministry is investment in technology and equipment?</h4><p>Many problems associated with the low level of competitiveness in the sector are mainly due to the low profitability caused by indiscriminate imports, which did not allow the adoption and purchase of equipment and technology packages that enable increased productivity, cost reduction, and, therefore, a considerable improvement of competition itself. In 2014, we have begun the process of restoring profitability to the sector, which will result in the acquisition of technology packages that will allow us to achieve the desired goal of increasing the sector's competitiveness, as well as productive restructuring in cases where there is a lack of comparative advantages, as our response to the challenges of the free trade agreements signed by the country.</p><div class="quote">“  The heavy investments made in the sector required an agricultural insurance system that safeguards and protects against adverse weather conditions.  "</div><h4>This year the forecast for Dominican agricultural exports is at $1.2 billion, the country being the largest exporter of cigarettes to the US and the second largest exporter of cocoa in Latin America and the Caribbean. What other export items could be increased in the future?</h4><p>In 2012, the Dominican Republic for the first time surpassed the $1 billion barrier in agri-food exports. By 2013, our estimates indicate that we will reach about $1.3 billion, leading in terms of banana exports, and being the first exporter of organic bananas, with exports of organic and conventional cocoa, fresh vegetables produced under both controlled and open-air environment, exports of fresh Asian vegetables, avocados, mangoes, and special coffees, sugar and sugar products, as well as premium cigars. This export volume must keep rising along with increased greenhouse and packing plant investments, as well as in the production of fresh fruits such as avocados, mangoes, and pineapples. We are working toward a goal of $2 billion by the end of the period of the constitutional government of President Danilo Medina.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are AXA Assistance's activities and objectives in Panama?</h4><p>AXA Assistance Panama opened its office in 2006, with a US Federal Plan, namely the Panama Canal Benefit Plan for all retirees of the Canal Zone. We dedicated around five years to this operation, after which we became involved in an important project with the Ministry of Tourism in 2010, when the government launched an insurance plan to cover all tourists visiting the country. We participated in the tender for all operational services, and today tourists coming to Panama are covered for medical assistance and accidental death. In the wake of that project, we introduced our products to the local market. Today, we pursue four lines of business. On the one hand, we have government contracts in tourism and with the Ministry for Health, and on the other we do business with private companies, especially insurance firms. In the latter case, one of the most developed lines of business here is roadside assistance. Another line of business we pursue with select clients is health, which is not only the federal plan but also attends to the individual needs of other clients in this line of business.</p><h4>What has been your recent financial performance?</h4><p>In the three years from 2011 to 2013, we increased our revenues by 60%, and we have forecast 30% growth for 2014. We are experiencing rapid growth across all business lines.</p><div class="quote">“Panama has seen impressive economic performance, which can only be attractive to prospective entrants."</div><h4>What client profile do you target?</h4><p>In Panama at this point, we are focused mainly on corporates, namely B2B. However, within a couple of years we are planning to offer an array of services, not only B2B but also on an individual level such as those offered by AXA Assistance worldwide.</p><h4>What factors underpin your notable growth of the past three years?</h4><p>One of our goals when introducing our services to the local market was and is the quality of service we provide. The Panamanian assistance market has mainly matured in terms of the roadside component. Yet the Panamanian people have yet to perceive the great benefits of related services, such as travel assistance, or concierge services, which we will be exploiting much more local market.</p><h4>How do you evaluate competition in the specific niche in which you work?</h4><p>In the assistance market in Panama, there are important companies such as AXA, who are the visible providers of related services. For many years, some of these companies have been promoting these services, too, but there is much more to be done. AXA, for one, always looks at how its offers could be further improved.</p><h4>What challenges will insurance companies face over the coming years?</h4><p>I think the key will be to nurture the market for a new range of services that make customers' lives easier and better covered. We need, therefore, to identify niches and look beyond competing with existing products in tried and tested segments. There is still much to be achieved in the assistance business line that people in Europe, for example, already take for granted. In our region, we are focused on mainly one type of service because the market remains limited and immature. This cannot remain the case, and we need to pursue a broader business model.</p><h4>What economic advantages would you highlight for a prospective entrant to the market?</h4><p>Panama has seen impressive economic performance, which can only be attractive to prospective entrants. Our decision, at first, was based on a client suggestion, but after coming here we observed considerable potential for business.</p><h4>What lies ahead for AXA Assistance?</h4><p>AXA Assistance Panama is working to strengthen it position in the local market. We are definitely interested in expanding our horizon to include areas such as Central America and the Caribbean.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the reasons behind the establishment of the Rivers State Sustainable Development Agency (RSSDA)?</h4><p>The agency was established primarily to tackle poverty and to address issues around under-development in the state. It was established to focus development efforts on poverty alleviation, youth empowerment, and grassroots development. There was a realization within the government that more needed to be done to tackle the root causes of poverty and underdevelopment in the state.</p><h4>You have a special program that focuses on education. Can you tell us more about your projects in general?</h4><p>RSSDA was established by law, and the RSSDA Act gives us a very open remit. However, we recognize that we have limited capacity in terms of resources. Therefore, we had to prioritize certain areas of focus. Within the first six years of our existence our focus has been on human capital development, agriculture, and job creation. As you may know, Rivers State is a hub of the oil and gas economy in Nigeria. This is a high-tech industry that requires qualified manpower and technocrats. So it was important for Rivers State to be able to develop talented young people to feed the industry. The state decided to establish a top-class overseas scholarship program, sending out young men and women to some of the best schools around the world to train in the disciplines that would fit the industry, and other sectors of the state where there was a manpower gap. That's the focus of our human capital development program. In agriculture, our focus is to use the sector as a vehicle to create jobs for young people in the state and to drive rural development. Agriculture also provides food security when it is done well. So our involvement in agriculture, which happens to be our largest portfolio, is focused on helping to drive sustainable livelihoods and grassroots development across communities. Our third area of focus, that is job creation, basically recognizes the challenge that exists not only in Rivers State but across the country, and probably across the world—the lack of jobs, especially amongst young people. Youth unemployment is high in Nigeria, and invariably in Rivers State. The agency is working together with other state institutions to drive job creation and provide skills for young people, to enable them start their own businesses in the SME sector. One way we do that is by trying to remove the bottlenecks that prevent small businesses from taking root in Nigeria. The foregoing is not an exhaustive list of what we do, as from time to time we also support projects and programs in areas such as health, water, and sanitation.</p><h4>In what ways do you collaborate with other organizations or institutions?</h4><p>We made a conscious decision in the agency to work with international and local partners, both within the development sector and also the private sector. Partnerships enable us to bring more to the table than we ever could as a single entity in terms of resources, expertise, and networks. When you work with a partner you have to raise your standards to meet those of your partner. We have to operate at a high level of integrity, transparency, and HSE standards for our partners such as Shell, Total, the US Agency for International Development (USAID), and the UN Development Program (UNDP); this enhances our own capabilities also. We are open to future partnerships. In fact, if you look at our annual report, we always begin with a chapter on what we have done through our partnerships for that year. That is a very important principle, and part of our strategy for delivering our programs.</p><h4>Where do you see the main opportunities for private investors interested in partnering with you in the economy of Rivers State?</h4><p>Rivers State has a very strategic position in the middle of the oil and gas region. It offers a locational advantage and a lot of opportunities for private sector international organizations that want to operate here. Amongst other things, the state has an international airport and a seaport. Over the last six or seven years the current administration has made single-minded efforts to upgrade and improve the state's infrastructure. Today, Rivers State is considered to be one of the few states in Nigeria that is capable of becoming self-sufficient in power supply, because a significant amount of investment has gone into developing a reliable, independent, gas-based power infrastructure. Combined with the opportunities that the oil and gas industry provides, this presents enormous advantages for serious investors. In addition, Rivers State has also been in the driver's seat with agricultural development investment. For example, a few years ago my agency established the world-class Songhai Farm, which provides a platform for developing the next generation of farmers. Then, we are also the State representative in a $140 million public-private partnership (PPP) initiative called the Agro Industrial Development Project, established between the LR Group of Israel and Rivers State. That initiative, modeled after the Israeli kibbutz agricultural system, is intended to develop a large mechanized farm with a cluster of model farming communities, and a major agro-processing center, together in an integrated agricultural project. Although it is a commercial project with a profit focus, the project is also focused around providing employment opportunities for as many agricultural entrepreneurs as possible. The value chain of the initiative will result in the employment of between 5,000 and 10,000 people through providing services to, or getting some benefits from, the initiative. Another PPP, the Rivers State Cassava Initiative, set up in collaboration with four private companies including DADTCO and Shell, and aims to take cassava production and processing to the next level. Our plan is to establish a cassava factory that offers a market for all of the cassava producers across the state. The project is aligned with the federal government cassava transformation program. The attractive thing is the number of cassava farmers who can, through the scheme, find a sustainable livelihood. In other areas, the state is also building a number of large fish farms, working with the Israeli firm ONIDA, as well as developing a 2,000 hectare mechanized banana farm with a Mexican company. Most of it is for export. Frankly, I do not know any other state in the country with such a clear focus on agricultural investment. We are not only starting new projects in partnership with serious international players, but also trying to revamp some big pre-existing projects, such as Risonpalm.</p><div class="quote">“We made a conscious decision in the agency to work with international and local partners."</div><h4>How can Rivers State and the federal government work together, from a regulatory standpoint, to provide more incentives so that you can perform even better?</h4><p>Rivers State is sub-national, and there is a separation of roles when it comes to regulation. Certain powers reside with the federal authorities, and some with the state government. As much as possible, we try to tap into the broader national opportunities that are available, through incentives given to investors. We continually work with our partners to identify those incentives and to connect work to them. We talk with the federal authorities whenever possible. Within the state itself we look at areas where we can make investors feel welcome and empowered to invest in the state. I see a lot of scope to work with the federal agencies, and we will continue to do what we can to assist. In most cases, the federal institutions have been very forthcoming. Once they know that investors are genuine and are trying to do good work that aligns with the government's goals, they are always going to support it.</p><h4>How important is it for your agency and for the economy of Rivers State to collaborate with neighboring states?</h4><p>While working with international companies and countries is important, I think that it is even more critical to have a collaborative relationship with the neighboring states. Whether it is in the area of peace and security, or common infrastructure, we are tied by proximity and reputation with the rest of the region. Also, if you cannot tap into the markets around you it will be much more difficult to pursue markets farther afield. If you take our cassava project, for example, it is the first of its kind in the entire region and we're already looking for ways to enable farmers from other regions to participate in the project. Regional integration is very important.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Commercial Bank of Qatar (CBQ) opened its doors in 1975. Over those 40 years it has developed into the leading private bank in Qatar. What are the key elements to this continuous success story?</h4><p>It all started when a few shrewd businessmen from Qatar thought about establishing a bank. They worked hard and sacrificed a lot over the first decade of the bank. Their ambitious aims and vision still contribute to the success of CBQ. I have to admit that over the years we, as staff of CBQ, have enjoyed their wisdom, their guidance, and their ambitions. We are therefore extremely loyal to this organization, and we are trying to continue on this path with their same passion. Since then, CBQ's success has mirrored Qatar's extraordinary economic growth under the wise leadership of HH Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani, Emir of the State of Qatar, and HH Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al Thani, the Father Emir. Qatar and CBQ have both shared the same rapid journey together to reach the strong position we are in today. CBQ is now the largest private bank in Qatar. However, CBQ has not enjoyed success simply by being in the right place at the right time. CBQ has been successful through its own multi-faceted strategy over the years based on innovation, trustworthiness, and strong corporate values.</p><h4>In the early days of the bank, CBQ focused itself on the needs of shop owners in the souk. How has that traditional relationship developed into a modern cooperation with its SME clients?</h4><p>Things were simple and easy back then, but Qatar has developed so rapidly and the economy and banking industry have become much more complicated. However, CBQ still retains a large number of these relationships to date, and has helped many of them grow and expand their business. The most obvious assistance for the small trader in the modern world is the ability to accept payments electronically. Whilst we will never forget our roots and the customers who helped create the bank, we are encouraging them to move from their traditional habits to more electronic banking channels. Another key element is our close relationship with the owners and their families. We have been able to support and guide them as they grow and provide them with access to the full range of services from CBQ to help their growth. Typically, these include trade facilities for issuing guarantees and letters of credit, plus treasury for foreign exchange requirements and, of course, working capital and term facilities to meet their day-to-day needs. We also hold workshops for our SME customers to keep them up to date on the bank's products and services and to provide them with useful practical advice and information on managing and developing their businesses. We have a network of partners that we can bring in to hold these workshops who might not otherwise be accessible to smaller companies.</p><div class="quote">“The government has made it extremely easy for international investors to come and work in this peaceful environment. "</div><h4>There are risks involved when entering into contracts with SMEs, because these companies often lack statistical backing or a clear strategy. How does CBQ reduce these risks?</h4><p>When dealing with SMEs, knowing your customer is vital and in many instances reputation, clean credit history, and good account conduct play a very important part in the decision-making process as there is little else to go on. We are fortunate that in Qatar there is a credit bureau that provides transparency on the credit behavior of not only the borrowing entity but also the guarantors. This is a very useful tool for the banks when assessing the risks of a proposal, and it is also having the effect of encouraging all parties to meet their obligations in a timely manner as they do not want to have a negative credit bureau report. In addition, within the SME area at CBQ, which we call Enterprise Banking, we have our own dedicated credit area, with a team of professionals who have a good understanding of the specific risks associated with SMEs in Qatar. Having our relationship managers working alongside our credit team helps to increase our knowledge of the market and understand the risks associated with the proposals we are considering. We also continually encourage our customers to improve the quality of the financial and other information they provide to us. This is not an easy task as the related cost is often a significant factor for SMEs. We try to help through our own workshops, but there is also now a lot more assistance for smaller companies via organizations such as Enterprise Qatar and Qatar Development Bank (QDB), with which we have a very good relationship. QDB provides a guarantee of 85% for project facilities, which enables us to mitigate the associated risks, particularly for small or start-up operations.</p><h4>CBQ features amongst the most popular employers of Qatar. How does CBQ invest in its workforce and what do you see in return?</h4><p>At CBQ, we believe that employees are the most important component in the quest to improve business results. CBQ has a solid foundation of goals and strategies, and it is clear to our employees that they are all driving toward one common goal. For us, training is one way of ensuring employees feel valued and can be part of a broader social responsibility strategy. At every level, we are creating a learning and development plan for our staff, and we are benefitting from continuous skill-based training to up-skill and re-skill our employees.  We can testify that there is an improvement in productivity, reduced recruitment budgets, and an improved level of customer service. Besides that, we are very committed to developing local talent in Qatar. The bank is dedicated to creating a robust talent and knowledge pool within Qatar's youth community, who will proudly represent their country in the future. In partnership with the College of North Atlantic-Qatar (CNA-Q), CBQ offers a Banking Associate Program, providing school graduates who are Qatari nationals with fundamental banking and work-based skills to develop further into the senior bankers of the future.</p><h4>In recent years Qatar has become an economic powerhouse that has attracted businesses from around the world. How does CBQ see its role in this open and globalized Qatari economy?</h4><p>We had to cross borders, and I have to admit the government has made it extremely easy for international investors to come and work in this peaceful environment. This has enhanced our appetite to grasp more opportunities, and the market is able to be fairer to everybody who can contribute to its growth gracefully and with passion. One of the challenges that each bank is facing is competition. It is becoming very tough. Therefore, you need to work outside of the borders in order to grasp a bigger market share in the country. This is a good chance for us to utilize this opportunity to the maximum. A lot of international investment businesses are coming here because Qatar's economy is booming, and we at CBQ are playing a part in this boom.</p><h4>Qatar Exchange received an institutional upgrade from Frontier Market to Emerging Market in 2014. What will this mean for the financial sector of Qatar and for the Qatari economy as a whole?</h4><p>The Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) upgrade is expected to result in huge inflows of foreign funds into the Qatari companies that have qualified to be included in the Emerging Market Index. Approximately 50% of these qualifying companies are in financial services (including CBQ), and so the upgrade means a clear boost for Qatar's financial sector. More widely, the MSCI upgrade is international recognition of Qatar's maturing economy and equity market.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<p>We have nine international airports, and 12 international ports, with competitive operating costs, highly advanced productive infrastructure, a diversified economy, and, most importantly, excellent and talented human capital.</p><p>We are also one of the six countries in the world that have, at one time, preferential and free trade agreements (FTAs) with the US, through the CAFTA-DR, and the EU, through the EPA agreement. These and other agreements allow us to have preferential access to 876 million consumers worldwide, offering tremendous advantages for companies established in our territory.</p><p>Some of our products are also number one in world rankings. We are, for example, the main exporter of cigars to the US, of rum to Spain and Chile, and the second largest exporter of cocoa in Latin America and the Caribbean. We are the third largest exporter of optical and medical equipment. We also have one of the top-five operating gold mines in the world.</p><p>All of these figures showcase the dynamism and robust health of our economy, confirming investor confidence in our ability, and the wide range of possibilities that we can offer. To take full advantage of this potential, we are promoting key strategic sectors of our economy, looking to expand its capabilities and successfully adapt to a constantly changing economic environment.</p><p>In the tourism arena, we are a favorite destination in the region. Now we have the challenge of diversifying our offer, creating tax incentives to attract investment both to consolidate the traditional destinations and to open new ones, capitalizing on the natural wealth of our country and the appeal of our culture. In the same manner, we strive to promote cruise tourism and eco-tourism.</p><p>In terms of infrastructure, we are uniting all parts of the country with a modern road network, some of them as iconic as the Ring Road of Greater Santo Domingo.</p><p>Agriculture is another of our strengths that is experiencing reviving profitability. We are investing significantly in the form of credit insurance for agricultural production, which I often supervise myself on the ground.</p><p>Meanwhile, free trade zones (FTZs) deserve our attention, given the importance of foreign investment for job creation, technology transfer, and foreign exchange. To give you an idea of how important the FTZs are for the country, in 2012 they became the main source of foreign exchange, even exceeding tourism, generating in excess of over $5 billion. The incentives we provided in the first year of the government resulted in the creation of 64 new companies, 12 industrial parks, and 16 extensions, which have created over 44,000 new jobs.</p><p>Another sector that offers significant opportunities in the Dominican Republic is energy. The country has notable demand that remains unsatisfied, and we have decided to open the sector up to international investment. We will initially hold a tender for two coal-fired plants. However, the goal is to have an increasingly diversified energy mix, which over the coming years can absorb the growing demand of an expanding economy. We are opening doors to new projects and initiatives that will help us establish the modern, competitive, and efficient power sector that is required.</p><p>Equally important for this government has been the reduction of bureaucracy encountered by investors. We have launched a one-stop investment service, which has drastically reduced the time needed to obtain permits and other paperwork. This service is directed to strategic sectors such as tourism and public works, and will shortly expand its scope to the remainder of the economy.</p><p>It is true that tax incentives and infrastructure are important for competitiveness; however, often the best step a government can take to attract investment is to establish a climate of stability and predictable institutions to convert the country into a safe and supportive ecosystem for enterprise development. We are working tirelessly to ensure this sustainability. Since the beginning of our administration, we have treated with utmost seriousness the rationalization of public spending, which was consecrated by decree, and have cut wasteful spending and redirected billions of dollars into productive sectors. In the same manner we have centralized government accounts into a single treasury account, limiting duplication and eliminating redundancies existing in public employee payrolls.</p><p>We also know that a diversified and competitive economy requires both skilled labor and a solid middle class with purchasing power. That's why we are investing in our people as never before through social support programs, but also in the most sustainable manner possible: by creating jobs. By promoting microcredits, giving advice and financial support, and through the provision of insurance to SMEs, we are helping to create thousands of jobs, and fostering a mentality among the population conducive to entrepreneurship and the pursuit of business opportunities.</p><p>Since we spend 4% of GDP on education we are undergoing a real revolution in this vital sphere. This revolution encompasses the entire training cycle, from primary education right through to university and adult education.</p><p>As for the rise in the Dominican Republic's middle-class, we are also experiencing a happy moment of progress, as are other Latin American countries. In many parts of the continent the central role that public policy can play in this process is being explored. Maintaining sober macroeconomic policies, while investing in social programs, our countries are year after year elevating millions of people to the middle class. To mention just a few steps in the area of health, we are ensuring that public health has universal reach, with the elimination of quotas in hospitals and, in parallel, are in the process of including 100% of the population into a social security system.</p><p>In short, our country is in a process of expanding its human and economic potential. We are reinforcing our traditional strengths, while opening up new areas for development. We are investing in our people as never before and taking the first steps toward the creation of a middle-class society. We are committed to both our citizens and national and international investors, offering a favorable climate for business creation, with a growing economy and a transparent and professional public administration.</p><p>I believe that the only way for our country to move toward development is through a strong partnership between business and government, and the Dominican Republic is committed to fostering a positive commercial climate.</p><p>On June 27, 2013, the Dominican Republic officially became fully incorporated into the Central American Integration System. Two days later we joined, with enthusiasm, the new Petrocaribe Economic Zone, which should help to boost our exchange and cooperation mechanisms.</p><p>The Caribbean Community (CARICOM) is, and should increasingly be sharing our natural environment in a spirit of cooperation and integration. It is our immediate environment and, as such, we will prioritize it, not only because of our geographic proximity, but also because of the historic ties among our people.</p><p>We also believe that tourism, a key element of our economies, should be an axis of integration between our nations. At the last Petrocaribe summit, where the agency stepped forward to become an area of economic exchange, the Dominican Republic assumed the presidency of its Tourism Commission. In the same manner, we offer on this platform of cooperation our experience in the field, and are committed to the development of the sector, and the promotion of knowledge sharing with our neighbors.</p><p>We are called to create an open and supportive economic space as a means of energizing the Caribbean integration movement, which will allow our main instrument, CARICOM, to become a flexible entity that can respond to both economic opportunities and our need for further political integration.</p><p>Our region has huge potential for growth and for bringing happiness and progress to the millions of men and women who share the beautiful Caribbean Sea. The Dominican Republic believes in and works toward that dream. And in this spirit, we aim to be part of a continent of peace and justice, capable of growing in equality and solidarity.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does the Superintendency play in bringing together the economic growth of the country and increasing demand for a more secure generation and national distribution of electricity?</h4><p>The General Law on Electricity was passed in 2001, the same year in which the Electricity Superintendency was established, and this law was modified in 2007. The Dominican Republic is rapidly growing, which poses certain challenges from an energy perspective, as the country has to distribute the energy needed to numerous industries, not least of which is tourism, to carry out their activities and contribute to the development of the country. On the other hand, the country has experienced an improvement in the generation and distribution of electric energy since 2001; around 800 MW of installed capacity in different plants has shifted toward more efficient generation practices. In terms of projects and policies, the most important is the tender process for two coal-fired plants set to generate electricity with a joint installed capacity of 600 MW. For example, there have already been some projects and proposals to increase installed capacity, such as a 300-MW facility based on coal in the Itabo Industrial Park. Additionally, Law No. 5707 sets out a certain amount of subsidies for those projects related to energy generation from renewable energies.</p><h4>How does the Superintendency work to balance the demands of distributors for increased electricity tariffs, with the consumer demand for more inexpensive energy?</h4><p>Setting electricity tariffs has to be done according to a particular technical scheme based on how efficient companies are, and the government has developed a plan accordingly; however, it has yet to come into force. Such development is still pending, and one of the main challenges we face is to incorporate the retail electricity market into this scheme. Regarding the consumer dimension, the general law on electricity stipulated the establishment of an Office of Consumer Protection, or PROTECOM, in each of the main urban areas of the country. Currently, the Superintendency has a presence in 17 provinces of the country, and we expect to open around 14 additional offices to ensure national coverage. PROTECOM enables consumers to resist the monopolies that certain distribution companies exert in their tendered area, and the Superintendency helps to further its expansion. Basically, PROTECOM works as a bridge between distribution companies and consumers who claim they have suffered from bad service or practices. PROTECOM investigates claims and disagreements between the two sides, as well as irregularities.</p><div class="quote">“We want to render the regulatory framework well respected and efficient."</div><h4>What are your challenges and goals for 2014 and beyond?</h4><p>We want to render the regulatory framework well respected and efficient, passing the amendments needed to strengthen it. We understand that the development of the sector has to be based on a strong institutional framework rather than the current players in the sector, as that could risk the future development of the industry; our goal is for the sector to sustainably grow over the course of the next few years. Additionally, the Superintendency prepared a quality standard on commercial services for consumers in March of 2012 to provide a better framework for both consumer and distributor; it aims to further increase the role of new technologies among distributors in order to better monitor the quality of their services and billing, among other goals. Its implementation had been scheduled for August 2013, but the slow adoption of technology processes among distributors has led to a postponement of the standards coming into force. Efficiency at all levels, especially in terms of the generation and distribution of electrical energy, has to be a common goal among all players in the sector.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you elaborate on the unique nature of your operations in Abu Dhabi?<br></h4><p>The perception is that Mubadala Development Company has sponsored us to establish Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi (CCAD) in a culturally relevant and appropriate format. Ours is a physician-led practice that combines people to foster the best possible patient care. In addition, it promotes collegiality and teamwork, not to the exclusion of individual success, but such that the team comes first and the individual second. We want our people to contribute something to the UAE that is consistent with Vision 2030, namely world-class healthcare for a world-class city. In short, our project here is about people, processes, technologies, and values: a replication of Cleveland Clinic right here in Abu Dhabi. We have 350 staff, though we started with just 40 or 50 people. Emirati staff comprise 13% of our personnel.</p><h4>Has it been a challenge to attract international talent to Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>We've had over 4,000 applications for 175 physicians' jobs. And that's not because we offer highly competitive salaries, it's because of our operational model that encourages physicians to reach their full potential. Thousands of hours of effort went into working with Mubadala Development Company to design CCAD with this focus. While most hospitals have separate departments, such as pulmonology, dermatology, or cardiology, here we put people in institutes where, for example, a heart doctor will work in the same facility as a heart surgeon or the vascular surgeon with the vascular medical practitioner. We organize our activities around what the patient needs, rather than what is traditionally more convenient for the doctors, which is quite a radical departure. Here, it's easy for patients to receive well-coordinated, thoughtful care, which eliminates the need to move from specialist to specialist.</p><h4>Do you focus on any areas in particular?</h4><p>We will have 32 specialties when we open our doors, although we're actually focused on five core areas based on the healthcare needs of Abu Dhabi. Among these is heart and vascular medicine, which is traditionally one of the Cleveland Clinic's formidable strengths. For 19 years we have been the number one in the US, and our cardiovascular surgery program is twice as big as any other in the country, with about 4,400 cases a year. Then there's the neurological institute, currently under development, which can deal with a wide spectrum of issues, from diabetes to stroke victims. There's also an institute for digestive diseases, which treats conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, which although a relatively common problem among the population here, still lacks comprehensive treatment. A fourth institute is the institute for intensive respiratory care to cater to the significant local incidence of lung disease. Finally, the fifth institute is ophthalmology.</p><h4>What does your facility bring to the region?</h4><p>People tend to talk about CCAD as a hospital, but in fact it is a medical campus that happens to be located on Al Maryah Island. The in-patient facility has 364 beds, which is expandable to about 490 beds. We provide day surgery to around 140 patients. We also have an out-patient facility, and 255 exam rooms. In terms of staff, we'll ultimately employ 3,000 people. We're an entire medical office complex on the out-patient side, an ambulatory surgery center, and a tertiary and quaternary hospital all rolled up into one with educational facilities, a beautiful auditorium and conference center. Then there's a complete diagnostic and treatment center where all imaging is done and laboratory needs met, as well as infusion suites with dialysis capability.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How was the Sheikh Zayed Institute for Pediatric Surgical Innovation founded?<br></h4><p>The Sheikh Zayed Institute for Pediatric Surgical Innovation was created through a generous gift from the government of Abu Dhabi. This gift stemmed from a longtime relationship between Children's National Medical Center and the United Arab Emirates. For more than a decade, the CNMC has treated children from the UAE with critical health conditions, and has worked to improve the health and wellbeing of children in Abu Dhabi through programs like the Pulse Oximetry Program, which screens newborn children for heart conditions. Through a connection between the late philanthropist Joseph E. Robert Jr., children's authorities and the leaders of the UAE we discovered shared a vision of improving medical care for children around the world. Together, we created the Sheikh Zayed Institute for Pediatric Surgical Innovation, named in honor of the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan.</p><h4>As a medical professional, how would you rate the technology developed by the Sheikh Zayed Institute?</h4><p>Some of the most advanced innovation at the clinic involves the unique application of existing techniques and technologies, with a specific patient group—children—in mind. For instance, our pain team took standard physical therapy exercises, and translated them into a language kids today can relate to, such as video games. They made sure that the system not only engages the patient, but also tracks their progress and provides valuable data to the care providers. We are also very active in surgical device development for pediatric use, as demonstrated by our inaugural Pediatric Surgical Innovation Symposium held in May of 2013. We hosted over 237 participants including representatives from the US Food and Drug Administration, National Institutes of Health, members of Congress, and our friends from the UAE Embassy in Washington, DC.</p><h4>What educational programs do you have on offer?</h4><p>Children's National Health System is known as a premier training center for pediatricians and pediatric specialties, and as such, we offer residencies, internships, and fellowships across all pediatric medical and research specialties. Students come to us from around the world to train and learn about the latest approaches to better care for children. The Sheikh Zayed Institute additionally offers a number of innovation-focused educational programs for high school, college, and medical students. Two of our featured programs are the Joseph E. Robert Jr. Fellowships and the Student Innovators summer program. The Robert Fellowship is a post-graduate research experience focused on biomedical innovation. During the fellowship, fellows partner with lead institute investigators to develop and translate innovative research concepts into pediatric surgical clinical practice, gaining hands-on experience in moving ideas from concept to practice. Meanwhile, the Student Innovator Summer program welcomes graduate, medical, undergraduate, and advanced high school students from across the globe into a rigorous research experience focused on introducing innovation management in a pediatric hospital to aspiring innovators. Both programs arose from the recognition that our vision for advancing child medicine involves equipping tomorrow's leaders with the tools they require to innovate — whether in the United States, the UAE, or anywhere else around the world.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the ECSSR evolved since its establishment?<br></h4><p>The ECSSR has undergone many changes since it was established in 1994; we have had 20 years to develop our organization. The most significant changes have occurred in our research department, largely through the development of the new processes we now employ. We began with a handful of people working here, and now we have almost 300 employees ranging from fresh graduates to experts in relevant fields. The ECSSR is very different to how it was when we started, especially in terms of our research methods. In the early years we expected everyone to be familiar with the methodologies; now, we are teaching them, offering three diploma programs for staff in our various departments. Everybody may undertake the diploma, whether they have a degree or not, so everybody has the opportunity for professional development.</p><h4>One issue facing education in the region is the emphasis on memorization and not critical thinking. How can education be improved?</h4><p>That is a big question. The right programs need to be put in place today, and only after 20 years will they be successful. It is important that we start today because it will take those 20 years to realize generational change. That is the only way to improve education. The desired outcome of that education will not be achieved overnight; it will require time. Critical thinking is very difficult. Although we have teachers, they are very traditional in their methods. These teachers began in the 1950s, and so reflect traditions built over many years. We want to change this, but it is very difficult. Presently, critical thinking equates to about 30% of teaching. We understand it is very important, but it will grow over time not overnight.</p><h4>What affect is ICT having on society?</h4><p>Technology is crucial in many aspects of national life, particularly education and the military; it is changing the world. Social media is changing everything. We are not dependent on TVs, newspapers, or journals anymore. Through Facebook and Google+ everything has changed. Technology here needs to be improved and people need to be allowed to accept it. There is hope that people under the age of 40 can become technologically educated, but it is more of a challenge for those over 40.</p><div class="quote">“You can't just consume a product, it's important to produce it and export it too. "</div><h4>Like many other countries, the UAE encourages nationals to enter the private and public workforce. What are the challenges of this policy?</h4><p>It is a good concept, but you are limited because Emiratis make up just 16% of the population. Much of that 16% is needed in the military, the police, the municipalities, and the energy sector. It is a good idea, but it is limited because of the size of the Emirati population. The private sector can be improved by becoming more national; however, it is a very difficult concept to achieve. A private sector firm, whether it is an international or national company, has to answer this question. I think it is a very difficult process for the private sector to become more Emirati than international. The private sector is bound by certain profit expectations, and so how they employ Emiratis can be problematic.</p><h4>Food and water security has become a growing issue in the region. How can the UAE ensure sustainable access to food and water?</h4><p>Food and water security in the UAE is a huge problem. The food problem can be tackled internally. However, water is a regional problem, not just for the GCC but also for the Arab world as a whole. The water shortage is universal and we need a solution to the question of water security. You cannot rely on desalination forever. This is a huge challenge for the UAE, as it is for every Gulf country. The GCC member states must cooperate because they all share the same problem. We have to work on this together to ensure not only water security, but also the security of the region itself. We have to address it together because the issues of security and water supply are of paramount importance to all GCC countries.</p><h4>What opportunities do you see in Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>There are big opportunities for oil, gas, and alternative energy. The energy sector is very important for the world, not just for Abu Dhabi. The 2030 goal for economic diversification is vital in improving the quality of life for the people here. They are used to the oil boom. Most of the people living today have not experienced life before oil. They can't go back, because it was a very difficult time. Energy alternatives are needed, and so far the UAE has contributed more to the development of alternative energy than many other countries. We can become a renewable energy hub through cooperation with the US, Germany, South Korea, China, and other countries, as energy is important not just for the UAE.</p><h4>Each year Abu Dhabi hosts the International Defense Exhibition and Conference (IDEX). How important is this event on the international calendar?</h4><p>It is becoming increasingly important because the fields of technology and the military are becoming more interconnected. If the military seeks to face change effectively, it must involve the technological factor; it can't just bear arms. The technological factor is very important to the military and must be a focus area. Germany is working to change its constitution, which will give it the opportunity to export military equipment. Technology will change the market for weapons. It used to be just the US, Russia, and China—but now everybody can produce it.</p><h4>What opportunities do you see from the Arab Spring?</h4><p>The Muslim Brotherhood is creating a major disturbance because it is not up to the standard of change. It faces many problems because of what it is preaching—aims that are very difficult to achieve. The Brotherhood wants things to be the same as they were 1,000 years ago—they can't be. People are changing, and I think it is very important to pay attention to this generation. Indeed, people are changing globally, and you have to pay attention to the people. What you learn is modernity. People want change. Whether the change is actually happening is another question, because I think the Muslim Brotherhood is counterproductive. In the Arab world, it is a contest between political Islam and the military. But still, the people want change; even if they remain silent about what has happened. They gave into political Islam because they had no alternative. But this revolution is not limited to the Middle East. It will happen worldwide because this generation wants change and they want it now. I think that change is coming.</p><h4>What opportunities do you see in the UAE?</h4><p>There are future opportunities in industrial and technological production, as well as in energy and trade. If the UAE wants to become an ICT hub, it must produce technology. You can't just consume a product, it's important to produce it and export it too. That will make Abu Dhabi a future hub for technology. It is very important to us.</p>]]></richbody0content>

In addition, we are creating lifetime investment opportunities and offering high-end properties to the market that ensure the building of sustainable and diversified projects. It is crucial for all projects we develop—whether tourism-focused or upscale residential offerings—are delivered to the highest standards that meet the needs of a rapidly growing tourism and real estate industry.</p><h4>How does TDIC partner with leading industry experts to help facilitate quality-driven projects?</h4><p>Our relationship with our partners, more than a commercial agreement, is an extension of our common beliefs and goals of establishing high-end brand consciousness, while maintaining our environmental commitments. The association, through our luxury developments with some of the world's leading hospitality and leisure brands, is showcasing TDIC's high-quality projects as an appealing modern destination for investment, tourism, and chic living. Moreover, partnering with some of the world's most renowned brands, such as St. Regis, Monte Carlo, Westin, Anantara, Cranleigh, and Troon Golf has added value in achieving our success.</p><h4>How is TDIC contributing to Abu Dhabi's economic and cultural advancement?</h4><p>As a master developer of major tourism destinations in Abu Dhabi, TDIC is contributing to the Emirate's economic and cultural progress by developing a wide range of cultural and touristic projects that embrace all aspects of Abu Dhabi's heritage and culture, while preserving its natural beauty and resources, thus enriching people's lives. For instance, we are developing world-class cultural projects in the Saadiyat Cultural District, including the Louvre Abu Dhabi museum, Zayed National Museum, and the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi museum, which will be opened in 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively.</p><h4>What soon-to-be-completed, big-ticket projects are you most excited about?</h4><p>Looking at 2013, we anticipate another highly successful year gearing up to deliver Phase II of the Saadiyat Beach Residences and Phase II of the Eastern Mangroves residences as part of TDIC's residential portfolio. We're also looking forward to starting the construction on Phase III of Saadiyat Beach Villas, already launched for sale. In addition, Redwood Nursery school, located on Saadiyat Beach and managed by Kids First Group, an internationally-recognized academic operator, is set to open later this year. Meanwhile, Cranleigh Abu Dhabi has kick-started its ground breaking works, and the school is expected to open in the third quarter of 2014. Moreover, New York University Abu Dhabi, developed by Mubadala, will open in 2014, making it the year where all the crucial education stages—from pre-school up to university level—will be catered to on Saadiyat. In addition, we're aiming to achieve new construction milestones in 2014 and the following toward the opening of the Louvre Abu Dhabi museum, set to open in the Saadiyat Cultural District in 2015. In January 2013, we awarded the construction of the Louvre Abu Dhabi to an Arabtec-led joint venture with Constructora San Jose SA and Oger Abu Dhabi LLC following a competitive tendering process. As for Sir Bani Yas, the Anantara Al Yamm Villa Resort is our latest addition to the island. Launched in July 2013, its 30 luxury villas offer views of the surrounding mangrove forests and intertidal lagoons with wading flamingos, while also providing guests with a completely private experience. Additionally, TDIC plans to open the Anantara Al Sahel Villa Resort by the end of this year. Comprising 30 villas set in the middle of the Arabian Wildlife Park, the lodges will offer guests once-in-a-lifetime opportunities to be close to its free-roaming wildlife.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[of-benefit-to-all]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>When businesspeople come to Abu Dhabi, what are the key points that they need to understand?<br></h4><p>Over the past decade, Abu Dhabi has become one of the world's fastest growing economies. As a result of its oil and gas resources, Abu Dhabi is a significant global exporter of goods and services, linked to the world's largest economies through trade. Abu Dhabi has shown remarkable growth and is highly instrumental with its progress. Currently, the Commercial Companies Laws do not specify any accounting standards framework for the preparation of financial statements. The Central Bank of UAE has made it mandatory for banks to prepare their accounts as per International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Listed companies also do so. In the absence of any specific standards framework in the UAE, most of the practicing firms apply IFRS in the preparation of audited financial statements, and apply International Standards of Auditing when conducting audits of financial statements.</p><h4>What do you see as a major advantage of registering a company in Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>According to major economic indicators, Abu Dhabi currently enjoys an enviable position; economic growth is accelerating and per capita income is one of the highest in the world. Abu Dhabi's citizens are wealthier and healthier than ever before. If one has a viable business plan and wants to tap into of one of the safest, most affluent and fastest growing markets in the world, Abu Dhabi is the right place to set up. Whether you are planning to start a new business in the Emirate or open a branch of a company based outside the country, the procedures are transparent and flexible. In most cases, it takes only a few days to complete the procedures if you fulfill all the requirements of the relevant authorities.</p><h4>What draws international businesses to Abu Dhabi's free zones?</h4><p>With the intensified global trend toward trade liberalization, the government of Abu Dhabi, which is keen to take full advantage of various opportunities and challenges created by the integration into the global economy, provides remarkable support for businesses established within the free zones. Abu Dhabi free zones attract international investors by providing a multitude of incentives, such as 100% foreign ownership of companies eliminating the need for a local partner, low-cost operational environment, full repatriation of capital and profits and exemption from import, export, corporate, and personal taxes. Abu Dhabi also has subsidized port utilities. That is what makes Abu Dhabi an attractive place, especially, when it comes to semi-skilled labor. The ability of Abu Dhabi to bring in skills from neighboring countries and attract even the skilled neighbors is surpassed by none. This was made possible by changes to the labor laws.</p><h4>Can you talk about how the tax system affects expatriates?</h4><p>Being an expatriate, no extra tax will be charged, which is what makes the Emirate so attractive. Also, people generally pay taxes in the country they work in and there are treaties in this regard. In Abu Dhabi, if you are a resident here you will not pay tax, which is a great advantage.</p><h4>The silver and gold trade is intensely popular here. What are some of the customs issues people face?</h4><p>Gold is popular in the UAE, which is known as the Middle East region's gold hub and the world's largest re-exporter of gold. The gold souks here have a breathtaking choice of jewelry including silver, pearls, and diamonds. The gold is generally 18 carat and sometimes 22 or 24, and styles range from Indian to traditional Arab and contemporary Italian. The UAE as a whole is remarkably attractive in specific reference to the privileges it offers in free trade. There is a huge Indian market for gold, which is made into traditional ornaments. People from around the world travel here specially to buy gold ornaments. Abu Dhabi not only provides these facilities, but also a variety of precious metals and stones.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does it mean to visit Abu Dhabi for business?<br></h4><p>In reality, there is an underlying message in where and how people meet each other. To meet in Abu Dhabi at this moment of tremendous change sends a very powerful message about the positioning of this region in relation to the rest of the world. The UAE is a success story by all measures, and this is its capital. It is also important that the World Travel &amp; Tourism Council (WTTC) meets in the Middle East, at a time when people are often nervous about the local situation. This is precisely why we feel it is an important meeting.</p><h4>How important is Abu Dhabi as a tourism destination?</h4><p>Abu Dhabi is a very important tourism destination that is slated to become even more important still. We have learned from experience that the key element in the success of any destination is the political will to make it successful. It is not about what a destination has, but what its leaders do with the destination's existing resources. There is a clearly demonstrated will on the part of the government to make tourism work.</p><h4>How important is stability for tourism in the region?</h4><p>Stability is always important everywhere in the world. It is impossible to sustain a tourism industry without maintaining a minimum level of stability. However, for the Middle East, it is a long-term issue. The Earth has shaken as a result of events in the region. Nonetheless, we prefer to look at the mid- to long-term situation, and in that context these events have the potential to bring about positive changes.</p><div class="quote">“Abu Dhabi is a very important tourism destination that is slated to become even more important still. "</div><h4>What effect do you think the rise of more conservative governments is having on tourism in the region?</h4><p>To reply with what I was told by the Prime Minister of Tunisia, who belongs to a party which is considered conservative, “there will never be a government in Tunisia that halts tourism, because it would have a catastrophic effect on employment for so many people." He was honest, and I believe that the benefits of tourism transcend ideology. Each country has to focus on its own strengths.</p><h4>How important would a single GCC visa be to tourism here?</h4><p>Very important, because it would encourage people to travel to more than one destination in the region. For visitors to be able to hop between different countries would be tremendous.</p><h4>What impact do you anticipate from the FIFA World Cup 2022 in Qatar?</h4><p>The event will be great for the region as an opportunity for millions of people to experience live in the Gulf. It will be an opportunity for the region to show what it has, and hopefully dispel some of the prejudices and ideas about the Gulf that people in the world may hold. Any country that is able to accommodate hundreds of thousands of people for an event is a country with amazing capabilities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What do international companies such as Wintershall contribute as partners to government providers?<br></h4><p>One of Wintershall's most important strengths is its ability to build and maintain strong strategic partnerships. We have been in Libya for more than 60 years, and Libya has gone through several periods of significant turmoil over the last decades. We have been active for almost 25 years in Russia, and have been in Qatar since 1973. It takes a while to foster a solid partnership, but once the trust has been built it has the potential to last many years. Achieving this type of relationship underpins our strategy. I would like to establish a similar partnership with Abu Dhabi, both in the Emirate and internationally. I believe that the current partnership structure in Abu Dhabi allows for more diversification, and I understand that the UAE overall has a political interest in developing closer relations with Germany. Another important aspect is that companies such as ours specialize in niche technologies that can provide additional value to countries like the UAE.</p><h4>Given the increase in domestic demand for gas here in the UAE, what demand is there on Wintershall?</h4><p>We know how to efficiently deal with natural gas along the entire value chain. Here in Abu Dhabi, there are fields that are currently untapped because their development poses significant technological challenges due to the high content of hydrogen sulfide—a highly toxic gas—and carbon dioxide. Our value proposition for Abu Dhabi combines our gas story and our expertise in safely dealing with highly sour gas fields. The Shuwaihat field, for example, which is currently being appraised by Wintershall as an operator, contains more than 20% by volume of hydrogen sulfide. Together with our 100% shareholder BASF, we possess highly efficient technology for removing the hydrogen sulfide and converting it into non-toxic products. This know-how stems from the fact that many of the German gas fields developed in the 1970s and 1980s were sour gas fields containing hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide, and from which we have reaped considerable experience.</p><h4>Given local exploration and production challenges, what focus does Wintershall place on R&amp;D?</h4><p>I would like to focus our R&amp;D research efforts on providing solutions for enhanced oil recovery. For many of the fields in the Gulf, it will be a challenge in the future to maintain plateau production. Therefore, the time is right to investigate the development of special chemical solutions that could enhance recovery rates in oil fields along with our shareholder BASF, which is the world's largest chemical company.</p><h4>The region has been characterized by political unrest. What impact is this having on the company's operations?</h4><p>Some five years ago we made a very conscious decision to expand our activities in the Gulf in order to balance Wintershall's global portfolio. Very deliberately, we selected countries like Qatar and the UAE as our focus. These countries are flourishing, and can be considered stable because of their wise and far-sighted leadership. The answer to potential risks in one region is a well-balanced overall portfolio. In fact, our well-diversified activities in Russia, Northwest Europe, North Africa, and South America call out for another region for our portfolio. We believe that our expertise and know-how, especially in the Gulf, could be well matched with the needs and requirements of our host countries.</p><h4>What is Wintershall's strategy to develop more partnerships across the region?</h4><p>My belief is that you have to build and maintain a true, open, and honest partnership with the host country, irrespective of where you are. We have to share knowledge, experience, and revenue for the benefit of all partners. We need to be able to provide a value proposition that clearly points to a win-win situation both for the host country and for us as an international oil company. We have decided to build our regional headquarters for the Gulf in Abu Dhabi, but that does not mean that we plan to do business exclusively with the Emirate. We have also made a gas discovery in Qatar and are working intensively with Qatar Petroleum toward field development.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[IRENA’s World View]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[irenas-world-view]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you see the development of renewable energy proceeding in the UAE?<br></h4><p>It is quite encouraging, if slightly unexpected, for an oil-producing country on the scale of the UAE to launch ambitious initiatives in terms of LNG efficiency and renewable energy. When the initial projects were announced, people wondered what our intentions were. I believe that these are now obvious; throughout the region and the UAE, we are witnessing rapidly growing demand for energy in step with industrial production, and a rising population. Increasingly, highly subsidized fossil fuels are being used for domestic consumption. At the same time, you see changes in the energy market and the emergence of new actors. The debate over carbon emissions is becoming more pronounced. For a country with a dynamic resources base, looking to the future to see how to build a strong, vibrant economy and transform the energy mix may strike some as a radical undertaking. Yet, once people have digested the Abu Dhabi initiative, it will become clear just what a prescient measure it was. One of the interesting effects of this was the amount of attention attracted to the region from a renewable energy perspective. In fact, a number of large oil producers are looking to its potential for development. We are seeing heightened interest in renewable energy and announcements from various targets throughout the GCC region. Saudi Arabia has announced ambitious plans for renewable energy deployment, to the tune of 54 GW by 2022. This will render it one of the fastest-growing solar markets in the world.</p><h4>What lies behind this shift in demand?</h4><p>Part of it is that the oil supply is declining. And what's more, the world is set to evolve in terms of its energy requirement. We are seeing a tremendous technological change and innovation in energy, whereby energy efficiency is poised for growth. Also, you can use hydrocarbons for more than just fuel. There is a much more nuanced thinking about the future compared to few years ago, and part of the more visionary aspect of the strategy to deal with energy evolution is to look at renewable energy generation for the future.</p><h4>How do you assess the growth of IRENA in terms of international recognition?</h4><p>The growth has been remarkable. We held our first assembly upon the formal launch of the institution in April 2011. At that time we had 67 members, but just three years on, we have over 120 members, with around 45 countries in the process of joining the agency. When you bear in mind that membership of the UN numbers 194 nations, and that we have 165 in the process of joining, you appreciate that ours has been one of the fastest-growing issue-based organizations in the world by membership. We are also attracting a tremendous amount of attention from academia. And what's more, we are seeing increasing public interest in renewable energy, which is promising for the future.</p><h4>What is the significance of such a large oil-producing country building the Shams 1 Solar Power Plant?</h4><p>The first thing people need to understand is that it makes economic sense. If you are subsidizing your oil consumption, it effectively means you have a very high opportunity cost of oil you do not export. If you factor that cost into the equation, the concentrated solar option actually becomes economical in the context of the energy you are not exporting. The plant marks a very ambitious initial step and has the capacity to generate 100 MW, making it the biggest solar plant in the Middle East today, and getting people to sit up and take note. Not only is it a large investment, but also an economically positive one. And as we enter the next phase of development, we expect to see the economics working in its favor. More importantly, the Shams Plant has had a huge regional impact. A high number of actors from energy administrations in the region have come to see it for themselves.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does the Regulation and Supervision Bureau (RSB) encourage the conservation of water and electricity here in Abu Dhabi?<br></h4><p>We have encouraged conservation in a number of ways. The first was the establishment of the Powerwise and Waterwise offices. They were established because of a desire for the sector to be greener but also to support the issue of our new electricity and water bills, for which we have won praise from the World Energy Council and other utility stakeholders. The new bills are unique in the region because they display the subsidy paid by the government of Abu Dhabi. Formerly combined, they are now split between water and electricity to message customers these utilities separately. We have a suite of bills, which are color coded; red for electricity, blue for water, and green for wastewater, which we hope to issue at some point. These well-designed, clear bills indicate the full subsidy and the unit rate for the consumer. We launched these new bills in early 2012, and within the residential bills we also introduced green and red bands. The green bands correspond to an ideal consumption level for a flat or villa. The idea is that if you consume more than this ideal average, you go into the red band, although the unit charges are the same. It is such a flexible instrument that it would allow us, say, to increase red band charges and modify amounts in the green or red band. Therefore, there is a whole range of things we can do with these bills that we could never do before. Meaning, this is a primary change in the way that people perceive their water and electricity bills and we rolled out a big campaign for this. We have also launched Waterwise and Powerwise to promote the conservation of water or electricity. Additionally, we are running several other projects, involving consumers of power or water. One of these, the residential end-of-use water project, where we install data loggers based on 150 customers, gives us a confidence factor of 90%. These in-line data loggers are smart and record the velocity and amount of water delivered to help identify where water is being used.</p><h4>The government is working to diversify away from hydrocarbon-based energy generation toward renewables. How do you anticipate this taking place?</h4><p>To some extent, plans to build nuclear power plants are a declaration of faith in the future. I think that in 40-50 years, the UAE will look back and conclude that nuclear power was a very good choice. In terms of renewable energy, clearly you have to structure your renewable energy approach to where you live. Solar energy may appear to be extremely easy here, but it is not easy to generate. We have 2 MW of solar panels on the roofs of about 15 buildings. Technology will enable renewable energy to become cheaper and more efficient. I really do feel renewables are the future, but remember they are dependent on the weather.</p><h4>How would you summarize market conditions for energy development in Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>We are very keen on an integrated approach from the provision of gas, or primary fuel, right through to the provision of services to customers. In this regard, privatization brings innovation and drives people to provide power and water more efficiently and cheaper. We have found that unit costs are declining and it is generally more efficient to use commercially focused companies to run a business as opposed to a government entity.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the key milestones and achievements of the company that reflect SENAAT's contribution to Abu Dhabi's industrial success?<br></h4><p>SENAAT, which translates as “industries," is one of the UAE's largest industrial holding corporations, and manages more than AED23.7 billion of assets for the government of Abu Dhabi. It has been mandated to create, optimize, promote, and champion capital- and power-intensive assets, which support the growth and development of the Emirate and the national economy. By bringing together a range of subsidiaries within its core specialties, SENAAT is at the forefront of contributing to Abu Dhabi's Economic Vision 2030. SENAAT is directly engaged in four of the sectors identified by the Vision, namely metals, oil and gas services, building materials, and food and beverages. Following the establishment of the company over four decades ago, a few of its key milestones include the establishment of the UAE's only integrated steel producer, which has become one of the largest vertically integrated steel producers in the GCC, the two very successful privatizations of two of its subsidiaries, Agthia in the food manufacturing and distribution sector, and Arkan, which makes building materials, and the achievement of 100% Emiratization in the management of SENAAT.</p><h4>Since 2004 SENAAT has shown growth of more than 30% in profits, revenues, and assets. What is your plan to sustain this growth?</h4><p>While we remain focused on the sectors we know best, SENAAT actively seeks new avenues for investment and is constantly working with its subsidiaries to identify and benefit from new investment opportunities. We are proud of the fact that we have the capability to grow our businesses from scratch, as we have done, for instance, in the case of TALEX, or with joint venture partners, as in the case of NPCC, to ensure that we have the best expertise and the strongest platform to build upon. We maintain our emphasis on capital- and energy-intensive industries, and we remain a very cost-effective contributor to the Abu Dhabi economy. To sustain our growth we will continue to carefully assess all arising opportunities, and will also consider widening our horizons—both geographically and in terms of the kind of industrial contribution we can make—in a manner that satisfies our criteria for economic returns and benefits to Abu Dhabi.</p><h4>Abu Dhabi is quickly becoming one of the world's top business destinations. What factors lend it credibility as an international business hub?</h4><p>It is true that Abu Dhabi is now being recognized for its growing reputation as an international business hub. Strategically located along major freight routes from Asia to Europe, it is developing key infrastructure to enable integrated transportation, links, and access. This, combined with its proximity to natural resources and very competitive energy pricing, helps position Abu Dhabi as a top business destination. Its tax-free framework within a stable currency environment adds to its attraction. In addition, Abu Dhabi's connectivity with the rest of the world, through Etihad's growing international network and Kizad providing capacity for over 1 million containers per year are crucial elements. In addition, Etihad Rail is a key project that enhances this connectivity, which will link up with other railway projects in the Gulf Region to increase trade and transport efficiency. But there is a variety of other attributes needed to make a business destination truly successful—not only economic, but also political, geographic, and demographic. All of these come into play in Abu Dhabi. The Emirate's resource-based wealth, its political stability, economic vision and the ability to realize it, the presence of a new generation of locally-educated leaders, and the availability of, and welcoming environment for expatriate workers makes it a welcome new focus for the world's business networks.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In recent years, Emirates Steel has committed AED10 billion to a two-phase expansion plan. How has this investment transformed the company?<br></h4><p>On September 26, 2012, we inaugurated the completion of our AED6 billion ($1.6 billion) Phase II expansion program. This Phase increased our total production capacity to 3.5 million metric tons per annum (MTPA). We launched our two-phased expansion program in June 2006, completing Phase I in June 2009 at a cost of AED4 billion ($1.1 billion). This has more than doubled our production capacity and made our company the largest integrated steel plant in the UAE, capable of manufacturing raw steel from iron oxide pellets. Our expansion has both directly and indirectly created over 2,000 jobs in the country; in parallel, many high-profile technical job opportunities have opened up for our UAE nationals. Today, we are the leading producer of rebar, and we are recognized as one of the foremost wire rod producers in the GCC. Besides our finished rebar and wire rod, we also have the capacity to produce and sell direct reduced iron and steel billets as semi-finished products. More significantly, we are now the sole producer of structural steel in the MENA region.</p><h4>What is your current production capacity, and what is your current output in MTPA terms?</h4><p>In 2012, we began producing at a capacity of approximately 3.5 million MTPA, following two expansions and the investment of AED10 billion ($2.72 billion). Annually, we produce around 2.1 million tons of 150 mm x 150 mm billets, around 1.9 million tons of 8 mm-40 mm rebar and around 560,000 tons of 5.5 mm-16 mm wire rod. As of the beginning of 2012, we began producing around 1 million tons of structural sections from approximately 200 to 1,016 millimeters in depth.</p><h4>To what countries are you currently exporting?</h4><p>Our domestic market share increased in 2012 to approximately 60%. This has been achieved through targeted efforts to support key customers and by pursuing sales policies that assist in bringing stability to the local market. Apart from focusing on domestic markets, where we sell nearly 70% of our products, we have exerted sustained efforts in increasing rebar and wire rod exports to regional markets, with a year-on-year increase of 67%, our most significant export markets being the GCC states, followed by Southeast Asia, India, Pakistan, and Iraq, where we sell the remaining 30%. We have the capability to produce and sell a wide range of heavy and jumbo structural sections from 0.2 meters to 1 meter in depth. We anticipate that GCC demand for sections is currently around 1 million MTPA. This market is further expected to grow at 3%-5% per year for the coming decade. A significant proportion of our structural sections will be sold in the GCC market, while the remainder will be exported beyond the region to Arab countries, Europe, America, Australasia, the Indian subcontinent, and Asia.</p><h4>How does Emirates Steel support Abu Dhabi's Economic Vision 2030?</h4><p>The meteoric rise of the company has always been in line with the Abu Dhabi Economic Vision 2030, which maps out the government's long-term plans for the diversification and development of the Emirate's economy. Each step has been made to ensure that we grow in parallel to the sustainable economy of Abu Dhabi, making provisions for global competitors within the Emirate's borders. As such, our ambitions run far and wide to become the leader in our area of expertise and in turn reduce reliance on imports. The main goal behind Emirates Steel being established was to serve the downstream sector, especially the smaller industries coming from the steel sector. Of course, we want to help create jobs for UAE nationals, which is one of the core areas the Abu Dhabi government has chosen to focus on.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What steps has Al Fahim Group taken to attain its current position in the UAE automotive industry?<br></h4><p>The late Abdul Jalil Al Fahim (mercy upon him), my father and the founder of Al Fahim Group, left strong values that have guided us toward making the right decisions. These values include substance, foresight, humanity, honesty, and we have recently added innovation. These values have guided investment in flagship facilities and a focus on our staff and customers that ensure we deliver excellent products and services across all our businesses. Customer satisfaction is number one in our business, and we change processes and offers constantly to ensure we maintain our leading position. We have a clear strategy based upon the “product leadership" value discipline, which has enabled the business to clearly focus on its priorities and innovation to strengthen our position. Clear key performance indicator (KPI) targets and performance-based management systems provide clarity and drive the business forward.</p><h4>What opportunities do you see in the UAE's automotive sector?</h4><p>The sector is vibrant and growing. We will always seek to offer new solutions to meet our customers' needs and new complementary products that fill market demand. We see growth in the premium sector, especially within the small car segment. For instance, when the Fiat 500 designed by Gucci and the Fiat Abarth 695 Tributo Ferrari were launched in the market we increased YoY sales by 50%. Mercedes-Benz has also grasped the opportunity provided by this segment in the UAE, having recently launched the long-awaited A-Class. Our first consignment virtually sold out within a few days. In 2012, we saw a growing interest in requests for customizations, confirming the trend in the market for individuality. We now have a “Bespoke" edition of the CLS/ML and GL, offering a much sportier look to the V8 models. We also have a range of super luxury Vito vans available for our customers. In parallel, we also look to grow our share of the super luxury sector further with the new S-Class Mercedes-Benz, which is among the favorite models of high-income businessmen and VIPs. On a broader level, we are witnessing a more environmentally aware generation emerge, which indicates the growing popularity of hybrid cars.</p><h4>Coming off the back of a high-performing year, how do you plan to sustain growth?</h4><p>Our expectations continue to rise and we have a growth strategy for 2013 and beyond. Our management is targeted to deliver customer expectations and grow market share. We are supported by strong principles and have the best facilities. We are investing in Al Ain this year, and look forward to growth and success across all of our operations. In the city of Abu Dhabi, we will be announcing an expansion of the Airport Road facility for Emirates Motor Company. As for Central Motors &amp; Equipment, another of our automotive business units, we are opening TYREPLUS, a new tire center to provide convenient and quality tire services through our sole distributorship of Michelin. We also intend to expand our operations with ADNOC to offer Bosch Car Service to everyone in the community. On a more tactical and customer-focused level, we have corporate affinity programs in place, as well as flexible payment solutions for individuals. We are also participating for the second time in the Sheikh Khalifa Excellence Award, using the opportunity to showcase our development since our last involvement in 2007. To succeed you have to keep improving, and this ambition is central to our success.</p><h4>How are Al Fahim Group's dealerships encouraging Emiratis to enter the workforce?</h4><p>Al Fahim Group has implemented a special employment strategy in line with the initiative of His Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the UAE and Ruler of Abu Dhabi, including the Absher initiative to enhance the participation of UAE nationals in the labor market. We have established this exclusive recruitment strategy in line with the Absher initiative's four main pillars: the provision of job opportunities in all sectors, rehabilitation and training, guidance and counseling, and encouraging nationals to work in the private sector to support the policies of Emiratization.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does GCAA deal with security issues presented by an expanding market?<br></h4><p>We are the sole agency in the UAE charged with the oversight of security measures at airports and companies. However, we are in close cooperation with other security agencies and the police in the UAE. We have one of the best security systems in the world, and have yet to find any weak points. That being said, we continue to advance and enhance our security so as to always be ready for any type of threat at any time.</p><h4>What is the significance of the recently signed open skies agreement with Finland for the UAE in terms of the movement of people and goods, UAE quality standards, and the local aviation sector in general?</h4><p>We have signed two agreements: one with Central Africa and other regions in addition to the Finnish agreement. We have, so far, signed 160 agreements. The UAE also signed a bilateral accord covering air transport with Mozambique. The agreement will pave the way for airlines to launch services for the movement of passengers and cargo, and will serve as a basis for the growth of trade and investment and the development of partnerships in sectors such as tourism between the two countries. We are looking to plan more agreements because part of our vision is to improve the connectivity of the UAE with the world. There is no use in buying aircraft if you have no flights to operate. I think we can lay the groundwork for airlines, and from there help facilitate their expansion.</p><h4>What are the main challenges the GCAA faces during this era of increasing partnerships between UAE airlines and foreign operators?</h4><p>Challenges will continue not only for the growth of our national carriers and operators, but also with the increasing demand for our airports from foreign operators. Those foreign operators come from countries that also maintain very high service standards and high levels of safety and security.</p><h4>What initiatives are in place within the GCAA to encourage more UAE nationals to join the aviation sector?</h4><p>We have jointly launched a campaign with other entities to encourage the national and local community to join the aviation sector. The campaign started by visiting schools and offering scholarships to UAE nationals. We have reached almost 30% Emiratization at the Sheikh Zayed Air Navigation Centre, and there is an ongoing plan is to increase that number further still.</p><h4>What does the recent certification of education and training institutions, such as the Gulf Centre for Aviation Studies, mean for both domestic and regional human resources development in the sector?</h4><p>We have many Emirati training centers serving the sector, one of which is the Gulf Centre for Aviation Studies. We are among the best in the world now in terms of providing training in safety and security, and our infrastructure is highly advanced. We are now offering training beyond the region, as far as Africa and the Americas.We are offering free training for many countries as well. Of course, this training will help us to make sure that wherever our aircraft go, we operate in a safe and secure environment. Internationally, we have agreements with the Latin American Commission to provide training services, as well as an aviation strategy.</p><h4>Do you think that the UAE can be described as a business hub?</h4><p>The UAE is a hub already, and European hubs are moving toward us. We handle almost 10 times our population in terms of passengers. We have a population of around 7 million, and we handle about 70 million passengers; no one else does that. Thanks to our infrastructure, short decision-making cycle, and our geographic location, we have a great advantage.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main areas of growth for Etihad Airways?</h4><p>Etihad Airways is one of the fastest-growing, commercially sustainable carriers in the world—a great achievement when you consider that we are only ten years old. From our hub in Abu Dhabi, Etihad Airways serves nearly 100 passenger and cargo destinations in the Middle East, Africa, Europe, Asia, Australia and North America. The airline currently has a fleet of 86 Airbus and Boeing aircraft, and more than 220 aircraft on firm order, including 71 Boeing 787 Dreamliners, 25 Boeing 777-X, 62 Airbus A350s, and 10 Airbus A380s, the world's largest passenger aircraft. Etihad Airways holds equity investments in Air Berlin, Air Seychelles, Virgin Australia, Aer Lingus and Jet Airways. Subject to regulatory approval, Etihad Airways will launch a new airline brand in 1Q2014, Etihad Regional, after taking a 33.3% stake in Swiss carrier Darwin Airline. In 2013, we launched flights to Amsterdam, Belgrade, Ho Chi Minh City, Sana'a, Sío Paulo, and Washington, DC and announced new destinations in 2014 including Los Angeles and Zurich. Our network is not the only part of our business that's growing. We have increased our customer base from 1.5 million passengers in 2005 to more than 11 million in 2013. We've built our group employee numbers from 3,000 to more than 15,500, across 125 nationalities. We have grown our annual revenues from $300 million in 2006, and had a turnover of $5.6 billion last year. We've been named “World's Leading Airline" in the World Travel Awards for five consecutive years—not bad for an airline as young as we are—and that is just one of many accolades that we have won. It also reflects not only the quality of the First, Business, and Economy Class products that we offer, but the fact that we are considered by our guests to be the best airline in the world—which is what we were mandated to achieve, and continue to strive for.</p><h4>How do you plan to sustain this incredible growth?</h4><p>Etihad Airways now has more than 40 code-share partners in addition to the equity partnerships with airberlin, Aer Lingus, Air Serbia, Air Seychelles, Jet Airways, and Virgin Australia. By building on the success of our organic growth, these codeshares and equity acquisitions are intended to give us the scale to compete on a global playing field. The equity investments provide the added advantages of cost savings to be achieved through synergies and economies of scale. The equity acquisition strategy is also designed to create a global footprint, extending our network and reaching new customer segments.</p><h4>How important is the strategic location of Abu Dhabi to the success of Etihad Airways?</h4><p>Abu Dhabi is one of the world's fastest-growing economies, emerging tourist destinations, and growing air transport hubs. The aim is to make the Emirate a global center of excellence and a global hub for commerce and tourism. As the national airline of the UAE, Etihad Airways is not only a critical part of the economic infrastructure but also a key driver of economic growth. It hosts world-leading attractions, from the world's biggest indoor theme park, Ferrari World, to the Guggenheim Museum and the Louvre, both of which are establishing facilities in Abu Dhabi. This cultural capital embodies Modern Arabia, with the values of respect and hospitality at the center.</p><h4>How does Etihad Airways differ from its neighboring competitors Emirates and Qatar?</h4><p>Etihad Airways is a full service carrier with a modern new fleet that offers an award-winning product. We believe it is our attention to detail and unique innovations that set us apart from all competitors, not just those in the Middle East region. A key difference between Etihad Airways and other airlines is the partnerships we have made, codeshare and equity, and the depth that brings to our offering.</p><h4>How does Latin America tie into the company's long-term vision?</h4><p>South America will play a key part in Etihad Airways' long-term plans to connect major destinations around the world. The airline launched flights to Sío Paulo in Brazil in June 2013, its first destination in South America.</p><h4>How has the Dreamliner grounding affected operation and expansion plans?</h4><p>We believe the Dreamliner to be a fantastic aircraft and it will play an important role in our future fleet plans. Etihad Airways has 71 Boeing 787 aircraft on order, with the airline placing an additional order for 30 Boeing 787-10 Dreamliners at the Dubai Air Show 2013. Those aircraft join the previous order for 41 of the Boeing 787-9 variant and includes the milestone 1,000th Boeing 787 Dreamliner to be ordered. The first 787 is due for delivery in 4Q2014. The aircraft will be utilized on core trunk routes where there is passenger and premium traffic demand across the network, especially destinations in Asia, the US, Europe, and Australia. Etihad Airways has significant plans for its 787s and will integrate its program with its equity partner airberlin. The move, which involves 56 aircraft, will save millions of dollars for both carriers, which together represent the largest single order for the Boeing 787.</p><h4>How important is the Middle East-Australia route to carriers in the region?</h4><p>The Australian market is one of the most significant and diverse in the Etihad Airways network and is strategically important. In addition to flying twice daily to Sydney, daily to Melbourne, and daily to Brisbane the airline also has a 19.99% stake in Virgin Australia Holdings. Etihad Airways and Virgin Australia have developed a highly successful, multi-tiered partnership that includes code-sharing on flights, joint marketing initiatives, and reciprocal earn-and-burn on respective frequent flier programs.</p><h4>Why do you think cargo freight bounced back quicker than passenger numbers following the global financial crisis?</h4><p>Cargo is a key element of our current and future growth strategy and today we are outperforming industry levels. Currently, Etihad Cargo generates around 20% of Etihad Airways' total company revenue and we see that continuing to grow. Whilst our current freighter network has the ability to develop in its own right, we're also active in linking freighter capacity to our growing passenger belly space. Over the past year, we have taken delivery of three new freighters, one Airbus A330-200F, and two Boeing 777-200LRFs. We will also take delivery of a further Airbus A330-200F in May 2014. Utilizing freighters to cargo-specific destinations, but linking them to the passenger core network maximizes the use of passenger belly space and dedicated freighter space. Our strategy will continue to focus on cargo-specific destinations, but in a way that feeds into passenger destinations, too.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the liberalization of aviation in recent years, and what steps still need to be taken?</h4><p>Etihad Airways openly favors bilateral airline partnerships over isolationism. There are still markets around the world that are restricted by bilateral or regulatory constraints, and Etihad Airways continues to push for these restrictions to be removed. The evolution of the global aviation market is being driven by the shifting base of economic development from first world, developed economies to emergent Asian powerhouses and the fast-growing BRIC countries.</p><h4>What role do sponsorship deals play in your business?</h4><p>International sports sponsorship plays a central role in our global marketing strategy. Currently, Etihad Airways' sponsorship portfolio includes Formula 1, Etihad Airways, Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, Manchester City Football Club, Harlequins Rugby Club, Etihad Stadium in Melbourne, Etihad Stadium in Manchester, and the GAA All Ireland Hurling Championship.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will the establishment of the Abu Dhabi Airport Free Zone strengthen the Emirate as an international business hub?<br></h4><p>The free zone is an opportunity to connect organizations that are linked with aviation directly, and there are a number of obvious examples. Cargo has a direct correlation in terms of growth in passenger numbers because suitcases take a fraction of the available space in the cargo hold, with remaining space filled with commercial cargo, as well as dedicated freighters that only fly cargo. As this airport grows as a global hub, so does the cargo component, adding significant business value. The free zone has been deliberately created for businesses that connect freight from one place to many others.</p><h4>Abu Dhabi Airport passenger numbers have increased from 5 million to 14.7 million in 2012 over a relatively short period. What noticeable trends are emerging?</h4><p>The large number of dominant markets is a function of population, the expatriate profile, and Etihad Airways. In terms of the markets for us, the number one is India, and interestingly number two is Germany, which came as a bit of a surprise. Etihad has a stake in Air Berlin, which changed the dynamics in terms of the way in which Abu Dhabi is connected as a regional hub. We have a number of very popular routes to India, Germany, Thailand, the Philippines, and the UK. The catalyst in many respects is the economic and understandably strategic Vision 2030. Etihad, a company that has exhibited a stunning performance in recent years, has also driven growth heavily.</p><h4>What potential is there for the growth and development of Al Ain International Airport?</h4><p>Al Ain is the largest inland city in the UAE, and is designed as the aerospace cluster. The growth of related businesses will largely determine Al Ain International Airport's growth. In short, Al Ain International Airport is a key strategic asset, and it will almost certainly grow commercially, but is unlikely to emerge as a major international hub.</p><h4>What unique offers can you make in this competitive environment?</h4><p>Emirates has been a game changer over the past 14 years, and the company has almost redefined what big fleets and mainline airlines look like in this day and age, and raised the bar in terms of quality. Etihad, while a younger and smaller airline, has arguably the same, or perhaps a slightly superior quality on offer and its growth has been remarkable. Emirates has enjoyed the benefit of using Dubai that as a destination has continued to evolve over the past 14 years. However, if Dubai is New York, Abu Dhabi is similar to Washington. This is the capital city and a different level of commerce comes with that.</p><h4>What role can ADAC play in attracting more tourists to Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>We are an airport-operating company that is focused on infrastructure. Obviously, the airlines decide where to fly, and for both Etihad and Emirates, a significant part of the business proposition is connectivity. Considering the broader Abu Dhabi Vision 2030, making the UAE a tourism destination is a key part of the plan. The work taking place on Saadiyat Island is a good example of a destination proposition for Abu Dhabi. Today, passengers flying from Frankfurt to Sydney and connecting via Abu Dhabi may choose a three-day stopover here because of the leisure attractions. Stopover tourists can watch a Grand Prix, play golf on Saadiyat, or enjoy our beaches. However, in terms of the airport operator ADAC, it is how we implement and market the airport infrastructure—there would be no Saadiyat Island without access to global transport. This is all part of the wisdom of Vision 2030.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What lies at the core of the Etihad Airways-Virgin Australia partnership and how do the business operations of the two complement one another?<br></h4><p>Virgin Australia and Etihad Airways formed a strategic alliance in August 2010, with the aim of providing seamless connections, reciprocal frequent flyer programs, and an optimized network, offering choice and value to travellers. We both have a strong focus on delivering the best possible travel experience, with personalized customer service as a clear differentiator. We were the first Australian airline to recognise the benefits of having a hub in the Middle East. As part of the partnership with Etihad Airways, we launched flights from Sydney to Abu Dhabi in 2011, becoming the first Australian airline to fly to the Middle East in over 20 years. While Asia remains very significant for Australia, the Middle East is growing as an important trade partner and provides a convenient gateway to key markets in Europe and beyond—our partnership with Etihad Airways provides our customers seamless access to over 50 destinations across Europe, Africa and the Middle East. Importantly, it also enables us to support visitation to the Middle East as our customers can connect seamlessly from our 48 Australian and New Zealand destinations through to Abu Dhabi.</p><h4>What has the increased Etihad Airways' stake in Virgin Australia brought to your company?</h4><p>We believe it demonstrates the confidence of Etihad Airways in our strategy and the future of Virgin Australia. Etihad Airways is key important alliance partner of ours ,and we are focused on enhancing this alliance for the benefit of travellers.</p><h4>Both UAE nationals and Australians are known for being avid travelers. Have you noticed a rise in passenger numbers with improved connectivity between the two countries during recent years?</h4><p>Under the leadership of HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, we have seen Abu Dhabi and the UAE grow rapidly as a hub for business and tourism. At the same time, airline connectivity into and out of Abu Dhabi has improved significantly. This has been reflected in passenger numbers as we see more and more travellers opting to stopover in Abu Dhabi on their way to or from Europe.</p><h4>Incidentally, the CEO of Etihad Airways, James Hogan, is also an Australian. What feedback have you received from him and other Australian expatriates about working, living, and doing business in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>We work closely with James Hogan and his team to ensure we offer a seamless travel experience, a convenient schedule, and the best choice of destinations. Both airlines are committed to providing a great customer service matched with a young and efficient fleet. Both have grown strongly over the past couple of years and supported competition in their regions. As Australians, we admire the pioneering spirit of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, which is investing in the future through building innovative hotels, cultural attractions and important infrastructure. We are proud to be partnered with Etihad Airways at such an exciting time.</p><h4>What is your opinion of the expansion of the Abu Dhabi International Airport, and do you see the city emerging as an increasingly important aviation hub?</h4><p>We are very pleased with the plans to deliver a world-class international airport to Abu Dhabi. As passenger numbers rise, infrastructure must be able to support this growth, to ensure Abu Dhabi continues to grow as an important strategic hub. The new terminals will increase capacity to 27 million by 2017, ensuring that passengers have a seamless experience be they connecting onto a Virgin Australia flight to Sydney, or exiting the airport to explore the UAE. The new airport will also bring efficiencies for us as airlines.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does Khalifa Port signify for Abu Dhabi?<br></h4><p>Abu Dhabi's Zayed Port has served the city for the past 40 years, but in 2011 it reached 767,000 TEUs, exceeding its intended capacity of 750,000 TEUs. Thus, at handling capacity, a new, modern port with room to grow was required. The answer was the new flagship, state-of-the-art Khalifa Port. Located at Taweelah, Khalifa Port is the gateway to Abu Dhabi. It has an initial capacity of 2.5 million TEUs, with space to expand according to demand. Today, it handles all container traffic for the Emirate, supporting its long-term vision of strong, sustainable economic prosperity. Abu Dhabi Ports Company (ADPC) was formed in 2006 from the restructuring of the Abu Dhabi Seaports Authority, and is the master developer of ports and industrial zones in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. Our ports, which include Khalifa Port, Zayed Port, and Musaffah Port, as well as the Western Region ports, such as Delma Port, Sir Bani Yas, and Al Sila, all provide vital infrastructure for the maritime industry, promoting the flow of imports and exports, while supporting local communities, sustainable businesses, and the wider economy.</p><h4>How will Khalifa Port and Khalifa Industrial Zone Abu Dhabi (Kizad) complement the other two zones already present?</h4><p>They are additions to Abu Dhabi's commercial maritime infrastructure. While we have allowed for and do provide a free zone at Kizad to cater for a variety of investor interests, our main focus is attracting industry-related investors to Kizad's vertically integrated clusters, where raw materials will be used by midstream producers and downstream manufacturers and then exported via the excellent transport links, which include, road, air, rail, and, of course, sea. ADPC is bringing a new proposition to the table with Kizad's dedicated industrial production, logistics, and distribution zone, which supports both Abu Dhabi Economic Vision 2030 and its future international ambitions. Also, ADPC is developing all of the Emirate's non-oil ports, for example, the 53-kilometer-long channel to serve our port in Mussafah, a thriving industrial area on the outskirts of Abu Dhabi city. The new channel is the second largest in the region after the Suez Canal and is capable of handling far larger ships, which will help support industrial and business growth in this important area. In addition, we can also confirm that it will be the very first port in the UAE to be integrated with the new intra-Gulf countries rail network, which is currently being developed by Etihad Rail.</p><h4>What trends have you noticed in incoming vessels?</h4><p>Vessel movements into Abu Dhabi increased in 2012, and our most recent results for 3Q2013 indicate just over 9,000 vessel movements. It should be clear that while Khalifa Port will become the hub port, Zayed Port, which has served Abu Dhabi for the past 40 years, will continue to serve the UAE's capital in most areas, aside from container shipments. Because of its size and draft, Zayed Port was never a hub; it was always a feeder port. That is why the size and profile of the vessels we are now seeing are different from those of previous years. The first vessel that entered into Khalifa Port carried around 12,000 TEUs. This would never have been possible at Zayed Port.</p><h4>How important is the trade increase between Africa and the GCC for ports in the UAE?</h4><p>People are talking about shifts of trade from West to East, but I think it is clear that there are a number of trading shifts taking place globally, and I think it has happened faster than anybody anticipated because of the financial crisis. There is more trade between Africa and Asia and the inter-Asian markets, so ADPC is working closely with Singapore and Hong Kong and other ports in Asia to identify best practices and operational management excellence. For our part, we see ourselves as being in the same category in that we can offer world-class facilities; however, we have only just started. We cannot compare ourselves in terms of volumes to the first or second busiest port worldwide—not yet anyway.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>On what is Abu Dhabi Food Control Authority (ADFCA) predominantly focused?<br></h4><p>We started in 2005 as a government entity overseeing food safety. In 2007, during the restructuring of the Abu Dhabi government, agriculture was also added to our mandate. We also incorporate livestock and farming under the ADFCA umbrella. In most countries, it is easy to promote elements of agriculture; however, in the UAE, we are short on water and most of our land is comprised of sandy soil of low nutritional level. Nonetheless, the Founder of the UAE, the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, believed deeply in environmental protection and agriculture. The result has been an “agricultural revolution," where we have converted sand dunes into productive land using our very limited natural resources. This enables us to sustain what we already have by leveraging technological innovation. We select crops from a long list of plants suited to our environment by being able to survive drought and salinity. That is why we introduce the best technology available and customize it to suit our own environment. Our farms are small scale—an average of between 2 and 4 hectares—and number more than 24,000, mainly distributed in the western region. These farms grow a huge amount of very diverse produce from early October/late September until May, and greenhouse technology makes for year-round production, albeit with limitations. We are an open country, and import food from more than 80 countries, with close to 90% of our food coming from abroad, which makes for stiff competition in the local market.</p><h4>How do you work with local stakeholders to implement new laws?</h4><p>In its eight years of operation, ADFCA has firmly believed in working closely with stakeholders. We work with our colleagues at the Abu Dhabi Environment Agency, as well as Abu Dhabi municipalities, and the Department of Economic Development, which is why our businesses are closely related. Our client is another relevant factor. We operate as a regulatory body and do not want to merely issue laws and impose them on the private sector; we want to share knowledge and experience. That is why in our strategic plan we hold stakeholder consultations for the private sector, and invite players to workshops in which we propose new regulations and seek feedback. We also have technical committees that review these suggestions and recommendations, whereupon we draft market-friendly regulations that help to promote business.</p><h4>Where do you see the main opportunities in terms of adding value to food production?</h4><p>There are opportunities not just in the UAE, but in every country. Nowadays, most crops are used as input for industry, and most of the world's major producers are starting to convert food into biofuel. We used to be a self-sufficient country in regard to fish five or six years ago; however, today we import due to the growth of the population in the UAE and the local catch shortfall. UAE dates are found in over 40 countries worldwide thanks to a government-owned company set up to undertake the global marketing of this product, and today we are self-sufficient. Vegetables represent the most important part of a healthy daily diet. To produce them adequately, we rely on greenhouse technology during the hot period of July and August. During the rest of the year we can grow vegetables in open fields, even in winter. Certain vegetables cannot be grown locally, which has prompted us to examine technology that could bring solutions to problems faced by our farmers.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the factors behind your recent impressive net profit figures?<br></h4><p>When net revenues grow, they clearly influence your bottom line. In 2013, net profit growth outpaced that of sales due to an improved gross profit margin in both our Agri-Business and Consumer Business Divisions resulting from an improved sales mix, competitive procurement, in-house production of previously outsourced feed volume, and cost-saving initiatives, as well as higher flour pricing in the northern Emirates.</p><h4>What is your approach to growth?</h4><p>Clearly, a key focus for us is to always grow our volumes ahead of market growth. If, for example, the water market grows by 10%, we want to grow by 12%-15%. The objective is consistent market share gain. Volume performance in 2013 has been reflected in market share; hence, in the categories across which we compete, our volume growth has exceeded that registered in 2012. We have seen an excellent response from the traders and consumers in response to our products and have a solid reputation for consistently delivering reliable products to the market. Flour and animal feed products tend to be a main revenue driver, despite diversification efforts. This business division has inevitably been exposed to commodity price fluctuations; therefore, it was not considered prudent to depend on that line alone. We have now built a wide product line that caters directly to the end user.</p><h4>Environmentally focused imagery plays a major role in your product lines. What is your approach to the environment?</h4><p>Naturally, we consider ourselves responsible corporate citizens. We are focused on four areas: health and wellness, food safety and security, people, and the environment. Each of these forms the pillars of Agthia's ongoing commitment to corporate social responsibility. Under health and wellness, we encourage healthy nutrition and an active lifestyle, while building awareness of a variety of health concerns. We organize a healthy lunch once a month for our staff, and give tips on what to eat and how to stay healthy. As a Group, we are involved in walkathons and other community events that address pressing health issues, such as diabetes and breast cancer. Food safety and security are very important for us as a leading UAE food and beverage company. We work together with Abu Dhabi Food Control Authority when it comes to food safety, as it is our regulator. We also support the World Food Programme (WFP) in its worldwide campaign to “Fight Against Hunger" by initiating a donation drive once a year to provide food aid and famine relief to people in need. Food security is a major concern in the region, and we play a particularly important role in this issue. We are actively involved in government food security initiatives; we manage strategic stocks of wheat and animal feed for the Abu Dhabi Government. On the people side, we have a duty as corporate citizens to develop local talent. We aim to train and develop 120 full-time Emirati employees at various levels of seniority, and whether they stay with us or not, we view this as an honest and valuable contribution to our society. Finally, in terms of the environment, we have a good record where it comes to energy levels and emissions. All our production units are ISO 14001 (Environmental Management System) certified by Lloyd's Register Quality Assurance. And as one of the leading bottled water manufacturers in the UAE, we have a commitment to reducing the PET used to produce water bottles, and have increased the level of PET recycling. Moreover, we systematically pursue initiatives and technologies that will allow us to reduce the thickness of PET sheets used in bottled water manufacturing.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main goals of your visit to the UAE?</h4><p>This visit is about further developing an already strong and mutually beneficial relationship between Ireland and the UAE. In particular, I want to raise the profile of Ireland not only as a provider of the highest quality food and ingredients in the world, but also as a source of technical expertise in the agribusiness sector that can help partner countries build their own food production capacity. In this regard, I believe that there is significant scope for mutually beneficial commercial opportunities in the provision of agro-services in areas such as food safety and quality, innovation, and product development that can lead to successful cooperation and collaboration between Irish and Emirati partners. Ireland shares the same honorable values as the peoples of the UAE, and the personal, face-to-face engagement helps to build the kind of confidence that can develop and sustain lasting business relationships.</p><h4>Where do you see the big opportunities for partnership between the Emirate of Abu Dhabi and Ireland in the agriculture sector?</h4><p>There are strong and obvious synergies between Abu Dhabi's food security policy objectives and Ireland's strategic plan for the expansion and development of its agribusiness sector. Ireland is a small country of just over 4 million people, but already produces enough food to feed 36 million people. Under its Food Harvest 2020 program, we plan to increase the value-added in these sectors by 40% and the value of exports by 42% in the period to 2020. In addition, our long tradition of food production has allowed us to develop expertise in the areas of food research, product development, and production engineering, and I believe that there are commercial opportunities for fruitful engagement between Irish and Emirati companies in these areas.</p><h4>Why should consumers in the UAE buy Irish food products instead of those of rival exporters?</h4><p>Ireland is a small island nation that is not rich in mineral resources. However, we have a mild maritime climate, plentiful supplies of water, and a landscape of natural pasturelands. We are fortunate to live in an environment designed by nature for quality food production. Our dairy, beef, and sheep products come from grass-fed animals reared outdoors in the most natural conditions possible. As Minister for Agriculture, Food, and the Marine, I am acutely conscious of the rare value of these assets. In planning for the development and expansion of the agribusiness sector in Ireland, maintaining a focus on quality production in a natural environment, while harnessing the latest technologies to ensure that food is produced in the most sustainable way possible is a key priority. The sustainable production of high-quality foods has been the hallmark of the food industry in Ireland. More than 11% of internationally traded infant formula comes from Ireland, and the fact that three of the four largest manufacturers of infant formula in the world have chosen Ireland as their home is a testament to our reputation for quality, safety, and sustainability. This is what people buy into when they purchase Irish food products.</p><div class="quote">“  Ireland is a small country of just over 4 million people, but already produces enough food to feed 36 million people. "</div><h4>How prevalent is knowledge transfer in this sector between the UAE and Ireland?</h4><p>There are already strong links between the Gulf region and Ireland when it comes to the provision of technology and expertise in the agribusiness sector. The Irish Food Safety Authority has established strong links with its counterpart in Abu Dhabi, and provides advice and information exchange in that field.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Where are the greatest strengths of Abu Dhabi's financial services sector?<br></h4><p>There are several strengths. Number one has to be the solidity of Abu Dhabi in terms of capitalization. It is secure and nonpolitical. It is a country that you feel is business driven. And it is growing around you and building a sophisticated platform to allow you to do business. With the right laws, technology, infrastructure, and geographical position, you can only succeed. This is what Abu Dhabi offers and these are its strengths.</p><h4>Did these factors draw you here initially?</h4><p>The solid nature of the market attracted me. As a trader I know that clients just want to worry about their position; they don't want to be worried about the government going bankrupt, or whether the company they are trading with is about to go under. We have one of the highest capitalizations in the world in terms of brokerage houses, and this is important for credibility and sustainability.</p><h4>What are the other competitive advantages that ADS offers?</h4><p>The advantage ADS offers is unprecedented in the region. It is a fully fledged investment and financial institution with all the services that a financial institution needs to have—brokerage, online trading, fixed income, and the global market. We offer liquid products that provide traders in the region and abroad with the opportunity to generate profits. The geographical position of Abu Dhabi is also important. When we are awake here and tracking the markets at 7.00 am, it is 3.00 am in London. At 3.00 am, the London chief dealers are asleep. In any market in the world, if the chief dealer is not awake, there is no market. This is where we leverage our geographical position to our advantage. When we first opened, no one believed that we would succeed. Yet today, we are trading billions of dollars in volume, and clients are opening accounts here every day, trading, and using our services. This proves that Abu Dhabi has a geographical position that people want to use, and that it can be a price producer. I want Abu Dhabi to be a market maker. Whether you want to sell Turkish lira, euro, dollar, or the Brazilian real, there will be market makers in Abu Dhabi to take this business. The region will bridge the trading between Asia and Europe and make sure that there is always a good price for all over-the-counter (OTC) products. The announcement of the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) puts the laws in place that allows this to happen. People can do business here, just as in London, Geneva, or New York.</p><h4>How does technology improve your services?</h4><p>Anywhere in the world, clients can open an account with us. We have offices here, as well as in Singapore and Hong Kong, and have teams covering all the main financial markets. You can deposit funds, download your platform, and trade. We have a major research department. We have invested heavily in research and information that allow you to have precise information on the markets. ADS representatives appear regularly on regional and international business channels to let traders know how markets are behaving. On the technological side, we have developed our own new generation proprietary platform. This is a first for the UAE and the Middle East. Nonetheless, you can have the best technology, but it won't work alone; you need to have a good price and, above all else, excellent service. You need to support and invest with your client, because only then can you claim to run a company.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does Abu Dhabi fit into the MENA business strategy of The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd (BTMU)?<br></h4><p>Abu Dhabi is an integral part of BTMU's MENA strategy, contributing to a significant portion of our assets and profits in the region. And as one of the most stable and fast-growing areas in the region it is expected to remain BTMU's key market in the MENA region. Abu Dhabi and Japan maintain a long-standing, strong relationship at multiple levels, especially in the oil trading area, where both countries are important partners. In addition to oil and gas and trading companies, there is an increasing number of top-tier Japanese companies with advanced technologies in other sectors, investing or planning to invest to contribute to the development of non-oil sectors under Economic Vision 2030.</p><h4>BTMU recently chose to co-finance a $3 billion loan to the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC). What does this mean for both your bank's Abu Dhabi portfolio and the development of the UAE energy sector?</h4><p>The $3 billion Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) co-financed energy and natural resources loan to ADNOC was in support of its investment to increase oil and gas production, and is of high importance to both Abu Dhabi and Japan. The oil and gas sector is the most important in Abu Dhabi as it is the primary source of revenue and accumulated wealth, which will then be used to develop various non-oil sectors for the achievement of a diversified and sustainable economy under Abu Dhabi Economic Vision 2030.</p><h4>How is BTMU working to support UAE banking and finance institutions?</h4><p>We provide support to UAE financial institutions and Asian businesses, mainly in the form of direct loans and trade finance. We provide direct loans to financial institutions on a selective basis to support their funding. Additionally, we are keen to assist UAE financial institutions with respect to trade flows, especially between the Middle East and Asia. We also pursue collaboration with local financial institutions in the import/export transactions area and bond issuance for Japanese corporate customers. As the largest Japanese bank, we are also able to assist the expansion of business and presence in Asia, which seems to be an increasing trend among local financial institutions.</p><h4>How does BTMU leverage on its international operations to develop capacity in its UAE workforce?</h4><p>MUFG has the most extensive global network among Japanese financial groups with over 550 bases in more than 40 countries, covering 40 million retail accounts and 500,000 corporate clients globally. Our workforce in the UAE is also in a position to leverage on such strength in international operations to support any customer requirements.</p><h4>Are you looking to grow market share in Abu Dhabi's rapidly developing market?</h4><p>In January 2013, the Abu Dhabi Government announced a projected $90 billion in expenditure over the next five years. We understand this is part of the long-term Abu Dhabi Economic Vision 2030, in which the government will try to develop 12 focus sectors and five enabling sectors as part of its diversification plan. Most of our existing customers are government-related entities in many of the strategically important sectors set out in Abu Dhabi Economic Vision 2030. Such sectors include oil and gas, petrochemicals, water and electricity, aerospace, industry, and financial services. We are always keen to look into any opportunities that meet our internal criteria and allow us to contribute to the development of Abu Dhabi.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What long-term plans are in place for gas in the UAE?</h4><p>The UAE has long relied on its gas resources. In 2007, the Dolphin Gas Project started to import more gas to the grid from neighboring Qatar. This was the start of our reliance on alternative resources in response to rising gas demand. Since then, the government of Abu Dhabi has also started to revamp its plans regarding more ambitious gas exploration. We started to look at the master plan to assess future growth potential and demand. In 2007 and 2008, business was booming on double-digit growth. We saw the potential for a decline in this growth level should we be unable to satisfy demand. During the crisis we slackened our pace; however, we were still experiencing growth, but needed to secure sufficient gas to justify it. Additionally, we looked at diversifying beyond gas alone. Gas is cleaner and we, as a country, are keen to target clean fossil fuel energy, rather than just relying on diesel or fuel oil, which are both more expensive and harmful to the environment. They are also not sustainable as they require many refineries, which present a logistical problem. Therefore, we initiated a roadmap that takes us up until 2030. We asked ourselves several key questions about sustainable growth and supply. We are still working on the roadmap, since it consists of several elements, such as diversification and renewables, for example. Today we are looking to diversify our gas supply. Emirates LNG is building the largest receiving facility in the world, with a capacity of 9 million tons of LNG, double that of the one in Dubai. Combining the two, the UAE will be one of the most significant players in the world when it comes to importing liquid LNG, re-gasifying it, and channeling it to the grid. To ensure this, Abu Dhabi alone is planning to spend $25 billion on gas development. We are looking to maximize our development to ensure sufficient domestic gas production to complement our imports.</p><h4>What does rising oil production entail in terms of increased workforce and project spending?</h4><p>We have a duty as an OPEC member to provide sufficient volumes of hydrocarbons and crude oil in the market to cater for future growth. Increasing our capacity is the right step to ensure the balance of demand and supply. Our role is not to produce constantly, but only when required. We believe that the increased capacity we have planned will satisfy global medium-term needs. For example, many countries during the crisis maximized output to keep prices sustainable for consumers. We don't want the prices of our products to rise prohibitively. When crisis occurs, prices usually spike. We wish to avoid this by having an additional reserve capacity. As the domestic use of hydrocarbons increases, part of the increased production will fuel growth within the UAE, whether it is liquid, refined products, or otherwise. That is the plan; we are investing and moving ahead with this project. By 2017, we will be able to produce 3.5 million barrels per day (bbl/d).</p><h4>What does the commissioning of the solar power plant, Shams 1, mean for the country?</h4><p>It is a demonstration of what the government of Abu Dhabi is capable of. It is testament to our commitment to promoting renewable energy, not only in the UAE, but also globally. We have completed several projects, whether through commercial deals or grants in developing countries. We have completed a project in Mauritania that contributes 10%-12% of the country's total power supply through solar energy. This project was realized through a grant similar to that of those we have completed in the Seychelles and other countries. My view of renewable energy is that it is complementary, and not a replacement energy resource for gas. However, we need to promote such projects to reduce costs such that renewables become more affordable in the future, and can compete with natural gas. We progressively see that the cost of solar energy is declining compared to that of liquid fuels, which are expensive today. With diesel, the dilemma is that we cannot know its future price. These projects demonstrate our commitment and keenness to develop technology through R&amp;D. I am optimistic that the price of renewable technology will fall, even though we see some challenges in the sector in Europe. Initially, it needs to be subsidized, and we must invest today in order to reap the benefits tomorrow. We also need to remove the barriers that make it difficult for investors to operate. Striking a balance is therefore rather difficult.</p><div class="quote">“  Abu Dhabi is planning to spend $25 billion on gas development. "</div><h4>Can you talk about the UAE's ambitious target to generate 25% of Abu Dhabi's power through nuclear energy?</h4><p>Today, Abu Dhabi is the largest national generator of electricity, supplying the Federal Electricity &amp; Water Authority (FEWA). It is also partially meeting Sharjah's electricity demand. We anticipate a nuclear capacity of 5,600 MW by 2020, with each reactor providing 1.4 GW in capacity starting from 2017. However, even an initial ratio of 18% to 20% of national supply is a very ambitious plan. Russia, for example, targets 20%-25% of its total generating capacity coming from nuclear power, and has been investing in and developing this technology for years. This crucial nuclear project has bought us some valuable breathing space for future planning. We selected the location very carefully to minimize seismic risk.</p><h4>How do you see the Western Region transforming as a result of these energy projects?</h4><p>Historically, the majority of people in Abu Dhabi come from the Western Region. Even though it has very limited water resources, the Liwa Oasis has sustained our Bedouin ancestors in the past. The oil industry also started there, and the bulk of the country lies in that region. Even our agricultural sector began there. Visiting tourists are surprised to see the farms and the 120-kilometer green belt that lies beyond the desert. The government of Abu Dhabi is working to create jobs. There are in fact many more nowadays, and the oil sector, the main employer, is well developed. The new rail link, intended for industrial purposes, will make the region more accessible to the whole country. Today, it is attracting more people to live there, as new infrastructure, public services, and educational opportunities, among other considerations, make it much easier than before. The government has invested heavily in infrastructure to make the Western Region a major energy hub—and not just in nuclear power. Indeed, the region is an example of diversification, where three forms of energy are in use: nuclear, oil and gas, and solar.</p><h4>How is the Ministry looking to develop the UAE's human resources in the energy sector?</h4><p>Human resources have been the country's major historic concern. Even though we always had capital, we lacked a qualified workforce. And while we have a small population, we prefer not to solely rely on expatriates. Accordingly, we commenced a system of scholarships enabling our youth to attend some of the best universities worldwide. I, and many others, have been beneficiaries of these scholarships. Today, the challenge is still to develop the young people who will join our ministries and assume the responsibility of delivering results. We need to compete on both a regional and global scale. We are building a specific industry, and do not seek to compete in every field, which is unwise. One of our selective areas, energy, requires the formulation of a reliable, long-term strategy for diversification. You will find that very few countries have diversified efficiently.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As a part of Vision 2030, Abu Dhabi is moving to diversify its economy away from oil and gas. What is the potential for clean energy in the UAE, and how is the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) supporting its growth?</h4><p>ADNOC works with other Abu Dhabi-based companies and institutions on cleaner conventional forms of energy, including alternative and renewable energy. Our cooperation with the Environment Agency—Abu Dhabi (EAD) and the Abu Dhabi Company for Future Energy (Masdar) are two of many examples in this regard. Also, since 1995, ADNOC has taken significant steps toward gas flaring reduction, which has now reached 75%. ADNOC has set a target of reaching zero flaring. Due to our strong belief in the potential of gas as a cleaner source of energy, ADNOC has embarked on various projects and developments that meet such expectations. The 2013 edition of the Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition &amp; Conference (ADIPEC 2013), of which ADNOC has long been the main supporter and sponsor along with the UAE's Ministry of Energy, will give more attention to gas in terms of discussion, participating companies, and papers presented by participants. The goal is to shed more light on forms of cleaner energy, including gas, which complement the overall direction of the UAE's government in utilizing all sources of clean energy. All such joint efforts and work are part of the government's overall plans for sustainable development and the Abu Dhabi Vision 2030 and UAE Vision 2021, in which adding a greater variety of energy resources would bring more diversification to the UAE economy.</p><h4>What opportunities are you seeing from the UAE's proximity to Asian markets?</h4><p>Asian markets are of considerable significance for ADNOC in terms of cooperation and activities, especially in the oil, gas, and petrochemicals business. It is reported that 25% of Japanese crude oil imports come from Abu Dhabi, and ADNOC supervises and conducts all upstream and downstream crude oil operations. Another example is liquefied natural gas (LNG), regarding which an agreement was signed to build a plant on Das Island off the coast of Abu Dhabi, with a supply of LNG that will last for 20 years. The agreement was to double production, with Japan importing the bulk for a further 25 years, effective as of 1994. According to sources, it is believed that one in four lamps in Japan works on gas from Abu Dhabi. Downstream, one of ADNOC's subsidiaries, Abu Dhabi Polymers Company (Borouge), has a production plant in China to meet many of the Far East's requirements for plastic solutions. These are just some examples that illustrate the importance of Asian markets for ADNOC and the UAE. There are many opportunities there and ADNOC will continue to sustain and boost its oil and gas trade volume with the region.</p><h4>How is ADNOC investing in enhanced oil recovery (EOR) methods?</h4><p>The term “post-easy-oil" has been emerging in the industry's discussions and on expert panels in recent years. ADNOC remains keen on turning to the latest technology and innovations, paying close attention to EOR mechanisms, research, and investment. ADNOC has assumed a responsible role in developing Abu Dhabi's hydrocarbon resources by maximizing safe and sustainable recovery from reservoirs, taking the initiative to assess the opportunities of carbon dioxide flooding for EOR, as well as sequestering it in target reservoirs. As part of the continuous effort to ensure the sustainability of the hydrocarbon supply, ADNOC and its group of companies are currently following an EOR piloting road map to test and prepare the major offshore and onshore fields for such EOR schemes. The EOR Road Map defines the timing, scope, and scale of the projects, identifies gaps in crucial data, sets the priorities for research, development, and demonstration (RD&amp;D) programs, and arranges various development programs for personnel.</p><div class="quote">“Middle Eastern producers will continue to contribute significantly to meeting global energy demand. "</div><h4>To what degree will ADNOC invest in infrastructure and human capital in order to meet the UAE's 2017 target of 3.5 million barrels per day (bbl/d)?</h4><p>ADNOC has set a target of 3.5 million bbl/d in crude oil production by 2017. And, in order to reach such an objective, ADNOC has been investing and embarking on a wide range of development projects and expansions in various lines of its operations. This involves the full capitalization of human resources and the greater integration of talented and qualified Emirati human capital into the workforce.</p><h4>What effect is US shale gas and Venezuelan oil having on the market?</h4><p>It has been observed and noted that light tight oil and shale gas are changing the traditional approach of producers—and as a result, of consumers—in the energy business. In the US, large recoverable resources of shale gas, coupled with an unexpected breakthrough in technology, has resulted in a cost-effective energy source. This gives the industry a competitive advantage and stimulus for healthy economic activity. It is fair to acknowledge that the industry would face some challenges, requiring new strategies and skills as the role of key players in the global energy market changes. Nevertheless, Middle Eastern producers will continue to contribute significantly to meeting global energy demand as conventional oil and gas supplies remain vital sources in the global energy mix for the near future. ADNOC plans to drill an appraisal well to assess the commercial viability of the shale oil and gas reserves across some areas of the Emirate. This is a natural progression for our gas sector, and we are open to exploring potential strategic partnerships to fully develop opportunities in the future.</p><h4>How is ADNOC encouraging Emiratis to enter the workforce?</h4><p>ADNOC devotes strong attention to education. ADNOC-affiliated academic institutions and programs, such as the Petroleum Institute (PI), the ADNOC Technical Institute (ATI), the Glenelg School of Abu Dhabi (GSAD), and the ADNOC Scholarship and Achievers' Oasis Programs have been jointly providing a full-scale educational package to highly qualified and talented Emiratis. The ADNOC Scholarship Program was established in 1974 to assist UAE high school students interested in university studies to pursue their higher education at prestigious international colleges and universities. Having completed their undergraduate and graduate degrees, they are offered job opportunities within ADNOC and  its group of companies. The ATI was established in 1978 to train young school-goers keen on pursuing their technical ambitions through training and development. The PI, which started to admit and enroll its first batch of students in the 2001-2002 academic year for males, and then in 2006 for females, offers students Bachelor's and Master's degrees in five engineering disciplines related to the oil and gas sector. Graduates from the PI enjoy the privilege of joining ADNOC and its group of companies to apply and utilize their learning experience in the field at the company's various sites and premises. This is in line with ADNOC's 75% Emiratization Plan target by the year 2017.</p><h4>With the Indian subcontinent on your doorstep and the Far East nearby, how important is the South American market to ADNOC's business strategy?</h4><p>ADNOC has been a key contributor in strengthening and consolidating mutual relations between the UAE and various countries and regions from around the globe, especially in the oil and gas sector. This has been illustrated for decades through crude oil field concessions, joint ventures, contractual partnerships, and other related activities such as the exchange of expertise in business and academia. ADNOC will continue on this path with openness to mutual understanding and cooperation in all investments and business opportunities for a better world and a more prosperous UAE.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The $10 billion Ruwais Refinery Expansion (RRE) will be the largest in the region. How important is a site of this size for energy security in the UAE?<br></h4><p>The project was planned and developed to serve three main objectives. The first is to meet the expected growth in local demand, especially in gasoline, and also to provide feedstock for the planned downstream petrochemicals industry, mainly through increased naphtha production. The second objective is to maintain the presence of Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) in the international market for refined products. As the country grows, local demand rises, and this reduces the export quantities of refined products. Once the project is commissioned, ADNOC's presence in the international market for refined products will be retained as export quantities increase. The third objective is to integrate the refining and petrochemicals industries. This is extremely important because both businesses have been expanding, and ADNOC has concluded that such integration is essential to optimize costs. Thus, the RRE and Borouge 3 were designed in an integrated manner from the outset. We will be exporting propylene and importing hydrogen, which will reduce capital expenditure and operating costs for both companies.<br></p><h4>How will the project contribute to the government's target of being petrol self-sufficient by the end of 2013?</h4><p>After we commission the project, we will be self sufficient in gasoline and will also have extra capacity for the next 10 years. Having said that, other initiatives are also in motion in Abu Dhabi, such as promoting compressed natural gas (CNG) as a transportation fuel, especially for the public sector. The aim is to reduce our reliance on oil and gasoline, mainly from an environmental perspective, as CNG is cleaner.</p><h4>What other plans does Takreer have in the short to medium term to expand its downstream operations?</h4><p>All of our plans for the refining industry have been fulfilled, and today we're consolidating and making sure that our investments are yielding the right results. The last project that Takreer was awarded was the Carbon Black and Delayed Coker Project, a heavy oil conversion scheme. It is in the detailed engineering stage and construction will start soon. The project will convert all of the heavy oil generated by both refineries, as well as the new refinery, into lighter products and specialty products such as carbon black, which will be used by Borouge, and calcined coke, which will be used by local aluminum firms such as EMAL. The project will ensure that the two plants become full-conversion refineries, and will bring our refinery to a high level of capacity and complexity, which will make for highly profitable operations once the project is commissioned.</p><div class="quote">“After we commission the project, we will be self sufficient in gasoline. "</div><h4>Given fluctuating crude prices, what are the challenges for companies such as Takreer to enforce cost-control measures, while also ensuring that state-of-the-art technology is available?</h4><p>Cost-control measures are extremely important in terms of ensuring that we have an efficient operation. We always benchmark ourselves with other refineries, mainly in Singapore or Rotterdam. We avail of Solomon Associates, which is a well-known benchmark agency for the refining industry. We use best practices and the findings of benchmark studies to make sure that our costs are managed properly. However, we recognize that there are always fluctuations in crude and product prices, and that any sharp increases or decreases can affect our margins positively or negatively. This could annul the cost-control measures adopted by companies. Therefore, we thoroughly study the application of any particular cost control measure. We never cut corners on safety and maintenance, which are crucial for us, and never make compromises.</p><h4>What are some of the challenges companies like Takreer face in today's rapidly changing market?</h4><p>In the wake of the global financial crisis, all refineries have been facing difficulties, especially old and less-complex ones, many of which are operating below capacity or closing down. We have taken actions with our new projects that will increase our capacity and complexity to ensure that our margins are always at least positive. Another challenge is cyber security, and many companies are working to first secure their operations followed, by other systems such as finance and human resources.</p><h4>How does growth in the northern Emirates contribute to the increase in local demand, and what increases have you seen in the international market?</h4><p>For us, the northern Emirates always featured in ADNOC's forecast planning, and growth there is also being taken into consideration. We are building a terminal for ADNOC Distribution at the Hamriya Free Zone to cater to local growth, and it will distribute our products directly in Sharjah and the northern Emirates. With this new terminal, we can ship refined products in bulk from Ruwais Refinery and unload and distribute them to customers, which is much more convenient from a logistics perspective. Regarding the international market, growth is mostly seen in the East—mainly China and India, as well as the Middle East to a certain extent. However, demand for refined products has declined in the US, Europe, and Japan due to the financial crisis that hit those markets.</p><h4>The US has increased its refining capacity, reducing its reliance on Nigerian and Algerian oil. What effect do you think growing US oil production will have on the UAE?</h4><p>This mainly concerns shale oil and gas, which indirectly affects the refining business. Shale oil is produced through a highly intensive process of hydraulic fracturing known as “fracking," which separates the oil from the shale rocks. This is mostly taking place in the US and will affect heavy oil producers. However, we expect the demand for energy to continue increasing, despite the economic slowdown. Oil prices are still above $100 a barrel. Shale oil will boom, but will also soon peak, before probably being abandoned altogether. Fracking requires a lot of water and the treatment of this water is also an issue. Nevertheless, shale gas does provide a cheap source for the petrochemical industry. Accordingly, it will affect the petrochemicals industry, which uses naphtha—a refined product—as feedstock. This can adversely affect the refining industry if the US allows producers to export shale gas.</p><h4>The UAE government declared 2013 the Year of Emiratization. What is Takreer doing to explore employment opportunities for the national workforce?</h4><p>We're in line with this strategy and support it 100%. Our main need is for engineers and technicians. In engineering, we depend on ADNOC Petroleum Institute (PI) and local universities, and it's an area where we always experience a shortage. We are also working to attract those with secondary education and develop them into technicians, mechanics, electricians, and operators. We have a genuine need for such workers in this industry. ADNOC's target of achieving 75% Emiratization by 2017 is challenging, but we have confidence to succeed. Currently, we have realized a 35% ratio.</p><h4>How challenging is it to recruit talented international staff, considering the high level of competition in this industry throughout the region?</h4><p>It is a challenge, which was proven when we started the recruitment process for our new refinery. There are large-scale expansion projects taking place simultaneously in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Oman. We are doing our best to attract high-caliber employees. And the UAE, being an attractive and safe destination for many, is supporting our recruitment of foreign manpower. We also realize the importance of offering competitive employment packages.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess demand for gas in the UAE and how does your company contribute to its supply?<br></h4><p>There is demand on a large scale for gas in the UAE, and the demand-supply gap is growing. Currently, Abu Dhabi is importing about 2 billion standard cubic feet per day of natural gas, which comes from the Dolphin Project in Qatar. However, even this is insufficient to meet the growing need for gas in commercial, industrial, and residential applications. Our company, Al Hosn Gas, will be producing 0.5 billion standard cubic feet per day in an effort to reduce the shortfall in gas supplies.<br></p><h4>What is the scale of the Shah gas project?</h4><p>The Shah gas development is a greenfield project located about 250 kilometers from Abu Dhabi City, in a remote area with no pre-existing access roads, water, electricity, or communications network. Our goal is to process 1 billion standard cubic feet of raw gas per day. The development plan primarily consists of drilling some of the most technically challenging wells, connecting these to a gas plant via a gas gathering network, processing the gas and associated liquids at the gas plant, and delivering end products via pipelines to the country's hydrocarbon network. In addition, we will be producing substantial volumes of sulfur as a by-product, which will be transported 256 kilometers via rail to the port of Ruwais. The scale of the project is huge and the facilities are among the largest of their kind in the world, primarily because of the sour nature of the gas, with an average 23% toxic hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and 10% carbon dioxide (CO2) content.</p><h4>How does the high sulfur content of the gas affect the upstream and downstream process?</h4><p>The Shah gas field was first discovered in the 1960s, and for close to 50 years was not considered technically feasible to develop due to its high sulfur content. It is tough enough to drill for sour gas in a difficult reservoir formation, and tougher still to build facilities on harsh terrain to gather and process huge volumes of rich sour gas, then separate them into condensates, natural gas liquids, ethane, and sulfur. It requires robust health, safety, and environmental management systems, state-of-the art drilling technology, and stringent manufacturing design and workmanship to effectively construct the facilities that could deliver sustainable production over several decades. As a consequence of the high sulfur content, the gas plant layout is wide and covers an area of six kilometers long and three kilometers wide. A substantial part of a gas plant is its “red zone," where no personnel are allowed under normal operating conditions. The four sulfur recovery units in the plant are about four to five times the size of a conventional sulfur recovery unit, with each unit processing about 2,500 tons of sulfur per day.</p><div class="quote">“  The Shah gas project was undertaken by Al Hosn Gas in pursuit of Abu Dhabi's Economic Vision 2030. "</div><h4>When will the plant be fully completed?</h4><p>The plant will be completed on schedule and become operational by late 2014. During the summer of 2013, we had a multinational peak workforce of 40,000 from several contractors and subcontractors working on the project.</p><h4>What have been the major challenges so far and how are you looking to boost Emiratization?</h4><p>One of our primary objectives is to meet certain Emiratization goals. We aim for 75% of the workforce to be UAE nationals by 2017. We are in a good position to meet this target; today, the figure is approximately 40%. The technical experience, skills, and knowledge that our UAE employees need to work in a challenging operating environment such as the Shah gas field will be hard to master, not just in the region, but even globally. Regarding the challenges to date, we have overcome many of them. One such challenge was locating the plant in an area that had no infrastructure. Everything had to be built from scratch, from access roads to electrical power, water supply, and a communications setup. Providing quality services with a pleasant work environment to our site-based employees such as accommodation and social and healthcare amenities, while challenging, was accomplished effectively and successfully.</p><h4>The breakdown of production is interesting. Can you provide more detail?</h4><p>The daily production will be approximately 500 million cubic feet of sweet gas, 33,000 barrels of condensates, 4,400 tons of natural gas liquids, and 9,000 tons of sulfur. All of the gas production will be for domestic consumption. The natural gas liquids (NGLs) will be taken all the way from the Shah area to Ruwais for fractionation into ethane, propane, butane, and pentane production. The condensate will go to the Ruwais Refinery for processing and the elemental sulfur will be transported by rail to Ruwais for export.</p><h4>What does this project say about Abu Dhabi's ambitions?</h4><p>The Shah gas project was undertaken by Al Hosn Gas in pursuit of Abu Dhabi's Economic Vision 2030. This project confirms that the Emirate of Abu Dhabi is keen to develop and utilize its sour gas resources by developing the technology and committing the required investment. The entire industry is watching our progress with interest. The Shah gas project will become an industry benchmark and its success is likely to spur even more sour gas projects. In addition, our high level of Emiratization, and the resultant knowledge and skills development that it creates, will ensure that our employees are well equipped to tackle the challenges of the future, a key objective of Abu Dhabi's Vision 2030. We are aware that the success of this project will create a huge responsibility for Al Hosn Gas. Yet, we are confident of living up to this responsibility by delivering a growth model that is sustainable, inclusive, and balanced, and one that takes into consideration environmental factors, human development, community and social responsibility, as well as business aspects.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the key milestones for the company since it was established in 1999?<br></h4><p>We have achieved several milestones in our short history. The first dates back to 2001 when the Development and Production Sharing Agreement (DPSA) and Export Pipeline Agreement (EPA) were signed. Then, a year later, Qatari and Abu Dhabi Emiri Decrees formally recognized the DPSA and defined the role of the project. Following five years of construction, the first gas flowed from Qatar to the UAE in July 2007, and a year later we achieved full throughput of 2 billion standard cubic feet of natural gas per day (scf/d). In 2010, we completed the Taweelah-Fujairah Pipeline Project helping secure much needed volumes of natural gas to the east coast of the Emirates. The year after, in 2011, we reached the production milestone of 3 trillion scf and at the beginning of 2013 Dolphin Energy reached 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent. These achievements could not have been possible without the support of the governments of Qatar and the UAE, the support and guidance of our shareholders and partners, or the commitment, hard work, and dedication of our employees.</p><h4>Dolphin Energy is a strategic venture between companies and governments. What does this venture signify for regional energy cooperation?</h4><p>The first thing it signifies is the way the governments, shareholders, and partners have worked together to bring a dream to reality. The project has helped enhance regional energy security and created a set of legal precedents that other nations can follow. It has also combined the strengths, expertise, and experience of our international and local shareholders to create a robust company that meets the needs of its customers.</p><h4>How does Dolphin Energy work with local educational institutions?</h4><p>We work with them in a number of ways—we offer internships to students studying in areas relevant to our business and sponsor programs with institutions like the UAE Higher Colleges of Technology. However, we also offer opportunities through our corporate connections. For example, we utilize our relationship with Total to offer MBA programs to national employees and are a supporter of the Absher Initiative, a program run by the Ministry of Presidential Affairs to train and develop Emiratis for positions in the private and public sectors over the next five years. Our involvement in this has seen us commit to employing 100 nationals by 2017 and training a further 500 for opportunities in the private and public sectors. We have joined forces with Tanmia and the Etisalat Academy for the latter.</p><h4>With five years of gas production behind you, what will Dolphin Energy focus on as part of its strategy over the next five years?</h4><p>The next five years will, I hope, see Dolphin Energy exporting increased volumes of natural gas under a new gas sales agreement so we better utilize the capacity of our export pipeline. It can throughput 3.2 billion scf/d—we currently transport 2 billion scf/d. We are exploring opportunities to expand our distribution network in the UAE to help meet demand for more gas. It is too early to go into more detail at this stage, but we're considering a number of options. Then, we will continue to focus on ensuring reliable, safe volumes of natural gas to meet the requirements of our customers and provide employment opportunities where people can train, develop, and build a long-term career with the company. Lastly, we will continue to support the sustainability agendas of the UAE and Qatar through our commitment to safeguarding the environment, supporting societal growth, and helping to drive economic prosperity.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the relationship between BP and its joint-venture partner Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC)?</h4><p>From BP's perspective, our partnership with ADNOC has been very successful. Through our enduring relationship, we have helped to establish a world-class oil industry and a set of high-quality assets in which we have invested for many years, delivering oil production and revenues. BP has played a significant role in the Abu Dhabi oil industry since the 1930s and was at the forefront of the discovery of oil in the Emirate in 1958. Our partnership with Abu Dhabi has endured over seven decades, contributing to the growth of the nation, while providing value to BP. Our shareholdings in the country's operating companies contribute a significant share to BP's worldwide production. Today, our interests in Abu Dhabi include shareholdings in the Abu Dhabi Marine Operating Company (ADMA-OPCO) (14.67%), the Abu Dhabi Company for Onshore Oil Operations (ADCO) (9.5%), the Abu Dhabi Gas Liquefaction Company (ADGAS) (10%), the Natural Gas Shipping Company (NGSCO) (10%), and Bunduq Company Limited (3%). BP seconds a number of specialists to provide technical and managerial support to ADNOC and the operating companies. We also invest in developing local capabilities, by, among other means, seconding national staff to different BP locations.</p><h4>How can international and local companies work together to further develop the oil and gas sector?</h4><p>One obvious area is partnership through joint-venture companies. ADCO is an onshore company that handles one of the oldest concessions in the world. It is 75 years old, and BP has also been there from day one. Historically, most of the nations in this part of the world had little capability and lacked good technical education programs. Over the past 30-40 years, the growth of the energy sector in Abu Dhabi in particular has improved dramatically. The UAE now has fantastic capability in running huge operations. However, challenges remain as the era of easy oil and gas extraction is almost over, and thus sustaining and increasing production are becoming more difficult. There are people who can still manage the situation, but we need the right technology and know-how to extract difficult resources. That is why joint ventures and collaboration are so important. One company works to bring together resources and people, while the other might specialize in contributing technology, know-how, and expertise.</p><h4>What effect is US shale gas and Venezuelan oil having on the market?</h4><p>The US shale energy revolution is obviously an important development. Technological innovation and supportive industry regulation have unlocked vast unconventional resources in the US, reversing the trend of falling output and altering global energy balances. Shale gas growth will gradually spread beyond the US. In BP's recently published Energy Outlook 2030, we see shale gas as the big growth story in OECD countries, providing more than enough gas to meet the projected increase in OECD gas demand. However, despite all the attention surrounding the shale gas revolution, in volume terms the bigger story with gas is the expansion of mostly conventional production in non-OECD countries, with the Middle East being the largest contributor.</p><h4>With oilfields maturing and enhanced oil recovery methods, how can BP contribute to the growth and development of the UAE's energy sector?</h4><p>BP is helping ADMA-OPCO to implement what we call the “digital oilfield" in brownfields and new developments that bring in technology to help increase production efficiency, increase recovery factors, and improve safety. We have worked with ADNOC to study the use of carbon dioxide in enhanced oil recovery within ADCO's North East Bab fields. We have also been supporting the Abu Dhabi Petroleum Institute in developing its enhanced oil recovery research capability. More broadly, BP has great expertise in advanced seismic imaging to help optimize reservoir productivity. BP leads the industry in a new wave of enhanced oil recovery technologies.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you talk about Schlumberger's presence in the UAE and its business performance for 2013?</h4><p>Schlumberger UAE GeoMarket is part of the Middle East Area, which has a geographical coverage stretching from Egypt to India, headquartered in Dubai. Schlumberger has been operating in Abu Dhabi since 1951; in fact we were in Abu Dhabi for the nation's initial hydrocarbon discovery. There has been a change in the market dynamic over the past few years, since the mandate to increase production capacity has allowed many interesting and challenging projects to start in Abu Dhabi. Schlumberger partners with ADNOC and its operating companies (OPCOs). The outlook is good and we are involved in world-class projects that make use of extended reach drilling. Also, we provide services for Al Hosn through its sour gas development project.  For northern Emirates activities, we work for Dubai Petroleum and Crescent Petroleum in Sharjah, for which we provided seismic activity work and are looking forward to the restart of their drilling operations. As far as our contribution to Schlumberger global operations is concerned, the UAE GeoMarket, with these challenging projects, has a wide scope and also saw solid activity growth in 2013; this was underpinned by support from our HQ in terms of additional resources and cutting-edge technologies to meet the rising needs of the UAE market.</p><h4>What will the renewal of concessions mean for Schlumberger?</h4><p>It will definitely mean more and greater opportunities. We will leverage the technical partnerships we have developed in the UAE markets over the years with the latest technology to meet arising industry challenges, as the “easy oil" no longer exists. I think we will also see different business models from the past. Al Hosn company for example—60% ADNOC 40% Occidental—greatly differs from the current ADCO concessions in term of the number of IOCs and their share ratio. The UAE will remain vital for Schlumberger; we are committed to the oil and gas industry in this country. For example, in 2007, we inaugurated our 120,000 sqm state-of-the-art Middle East &amp; Asia Training Centre. The center's land was donated by ADNOC, which we greatly appreciate.</p><h4>Which of your technologies can be employed in these new projects?</h4><p>Schlumberger is highly diverse, with 15 technology segments, all being present in the UAE. In that respect, there is definitely much on hand as far as reservoir characterization and enhanced oil recovery are concerned. Sour gas with a high H2S content is not a straightforward matter, and requires special equipment and an upgrade to meet this harsh environment. We are focused on adapting our existing technology to accommodate such environments. Drilling is definitely another domain where a lot of new Schlumberger technology is being brought to the market, in particular a 35,000 feet extended reach well is being drilled. In April 2013 we inaugurated the Drilling PetroTechnical Engineering Centre (PTEC) under the patronage of ADNOC to address the increased drilling complexity observed in the UAE. The Drilling PTEC now hosts 25 drilling experts with various domains. The UAE is in fact a test destination for our new technology, and another example to support their deployment is our Abu Dhabi Geoscience and Petroleum Engineering Centre, where more than 30 experts work on sub-surface studies from exploration study to a full-field development study. Our partnership with ADNOC and its OPCOs has allowed us to identify technology needs, resulting in many submissions of proposals from the UAE to Schlumberger regarding R&amp;D. Schlumberger invested a colossal $1.2 billion in R&amp;D in 2012, and we have always been a technology company. Yet it's not enough to have the technology; it has to work reliably in changing environments.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the factors that render credibility to Abu Dhabi as an international business hub?<br></h4><p>When it established its Vision 2030, Abu Dhabi produced a clear strategy with transparent targets and a road map of where the Emirate was heading. It is an Emirate that is working in the best interests of its people, in line with the vision of our leaders. The results of this plan on Abu Dhabi's progress are undeniable, and notable achievements are made every year, with more yet to come. Abu Dhabi's strategy has enabled it to earn a high level of trust with investors globally. Moving forward steadily, the Emirate is witnessing constant economic growth. Our leaders are committed to achieving the goals set out by the 2030 vision, and we are all working together to ensure that we have all the requirements to move forward with this plan. Abu Dhabi's economy forms a significant portion of the UAE's GDP. The Emirate is focused on strengthening its different sectors, and on diversifying its sources of income. All initiatives that are implemented by different organizations and authorities are meant to aid it in achieving this goal.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the growth of the industrial sector and what has been the contribution of ZonesCorp?</h4><p>Since its inception almost nine years ago in 2004, ZonesCorp has been through several phases. We have developed three cities in Abu Dhabi and two other cities in the Al Ain. We have made great achievements over the years. In addition to being ranked as one of the top-five government entities, we have targeted many of the gaps relating to the industrial sector market and enhanced the ease of doing business for this field. Previously, the process of applying to obtain a plot of land could take up to one year, and we reduced the time to just 50 days in 2012. In the past two years, we have registered notable growth in our land leasing activities, which had a positive impact on the growth of Abu Dhabi's industrial sector. We have also cleared our land bank. I am proud to say that ZonesCorp has the largest industrial zone in the UAE, with the highest standards of infrastructure, systems, and a highly transparent approach. In the 2030 strategy, one of the key pillars is the industrial sector—whether upstream, midstream, or downstream. The industrial sector is one component of the bigger package that Abu Dhabi's government is working on, ranging from education to health and finance. All of these components are combined to achieve a larger goal; we are a small, but significant part of the larger picture.</p><h4>What areas do you see as being ripe for foreign investment?</h4><p>The government of Abu Dhabi has published its strategy for industry, and there are key elements global and local investors should consider. There are opportunities in the oil and gas, petrochemicals, metals, steel, aluminum, and construction sectors. These already exist and can be built upon. In terms of industry, when you choose Abu Dhabi, the aim is not limited to the local market—it is also about exporting toward India, Southeast Asia, and Europe. Many Indian investors come to Abu Dhabi to target the local market and the region, but their main aim is Europe. The UAE has signed memorandums of understanding (MoUs) with many other nations to facilitate trade flows and business set ups. Investors see the UAE and Abu Dhabi as a base for their way forward into the international markets. They see the infrastructure, services, support, and guidance provided as an asset to their growth plans and strategies.</p><h4>What opportunities are there for ZonesCorp to engage with higher education institutions to foster entrepreneurial behavior within Emirati nationals?</h4><p>We will do whatever is needed to spread awareness. We have to educate our future generation on the importance of industry. Every large and developed country that is a leader in the industrial sector is built based on SMEs—Germany, Italy, and France, to name a few. Our people need to emulate this. The most important factor is to foster confidence so that, once an investment is made in an SME, we are capable of taking it forward.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does the UAE's Green Economy Initiative encourage economic growth?<br></h4><p>The Emirates Green Development Strategy launched by HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE, and Ruler of Dubai, in January 2012, seeks to achieve economic objectives with the target of community development by creating job opportunities through the development of sustainable growth. This strategy will enhance the competitiveness of the state economy, reduce financial burdens on the government, and enhance the state's image as a leading investment destination by attracting green investments, enhancing economic diversification, and establishing new innovation- and technology-based projects and industries. All this, in turn, should make the UAE a global center for the export and re-export of green products and technologies.</p><h4>How have local businesses responded to the Environmental Performance Card (EPC) program, and what dividends has it reaped for the country?</h4><p>The EPC was granted to 10 industrial businesses in 2009, 25 in 2010, 37 in 2011, and 55 in 2012, while the Ministry targeted about 70 businesses nationwide in 2013. The response from industry has generally been good, backed by the cooperation of competent local authorities. The initiative will encourage industrial businesses to compete in compliance with environmental initiatives to conserve the environment and maintain sustainable development to the advantage of the nation in general; especially given the UAE government adopts the green economy approach as well.</p><h4>What ministerial policies contributed to the UAE receiving an improved performance rating, as well as the best ranking of any GCC country in Yale University's 2012 Environmental Performance Index (EPI)?</h4><p>The Ministry of Environment and Water (MOEW) adopted the Strategic Plan 2011-2013 for the improvement of the country's EPI listing as a part of the objective to enhance environmental security, which is one of the five strategic objectives of the Ministry. In this regard, it has laid down a set of initiatives and plans with a view to improving the national position in this index, such as improving the level of protection of biological zones and fragile environments, the application of the integrated management of desertification, and improving the ecological footprint index, among others.</p><div class="quote">“  The Ministry's current operating plan approves a strategic indicator concerned with cutting demand for groundwater. "</div><h4>What is the UAE's plan for handling long-term water stress, given projections of sustained population growth here (especially in Abu Dhabi) and rising water scarcity across the Middle East?</h4><p>The management of water resources, especially the provision of fresh water and the services related to potable water, is a matter of international priority that has a growing importance in the light of increasing pressures and challenges to water resources worldwide, such as the increasing demand on water and the challenges of waste, depletion, and pollution. These pressures are aggravated with the impact of climate change on water resources. In the UAE, the water issue has always been paid particular attention since the beginning of the comprehensive development of the country in the early 1970s. As far as future planning of water resources is concerned, the UAE seeks to ensure the sustainability of its water security by integrating the management of the available limited natural water resources and non-traditional water. This includes the sustainability of the strategic industry of seawater desalination as a source of fresh water by focusing on modern desalination technologies, the use of sources of renewable and alternative energies, and the sound environmental management of water from desalination stations. In this respect, a reference can be made to the national strategy on the conservation of water resources, which is a 10-year strategy and adopts the drivers and policies of demand managed by rationing the use and conservation of water in all sectors, prepared by the Ministry in 2010 and approved by the Cabinet. We also have legislation prohibiting the export of water filled from groundwater sources. The Ministry's current operating plan approves a strategic indicator concerned with cutting demand for groundwater, which is being implemented in coordination with the Ministry's partner agencies through developing agricultural policies that target cutting water consumption in the agriculture sector, which is the main consumer of groundwater in the UAE.</p><h4>How does MOEW contribute to the development of agriculture and aquaculture and work toward improving sustainable food security in the UAE?</h4><p>We are aware of the importance of our marine wealth. In addition to its economic and social importance, it also contributes to enhancing food security, as well as helping people to earn a living in the community segments working in fishing and related occupations. Fish farming in the UAE will grow over the coming years, especially upon the completion of the Khalifa Bin Zayed Center for Marine Research. The productivity of the Center will rise from 200,000 fish fingerlings currently to about 10 million in addition to the development of operations in the field of scientific research and studies of fish wealth. Additionally, the Ministry seeks to motivate more private-sector institutions to invest in this promising industry, which is the world's fastest growing sector of animal food production in terms of security. In regard to agriculture, we have established guidance units and veterinary clinics with technical cadres to cover all parts of the country and to serve farmers and animal breeders free of charge. Thanks to these efforts, the number of farms rose from 4,000 in the early 1970s to 40,574 in 2011, and cultivated area jumped from 3,000 hectares in 1968 to 115,150 hectares in 2011, while agricultural production reached 2.1 million tons in 2010. The farmers are supported annually with agricultural production supplies for 50% of the cost price to encourage agricultural production and enhance food safety. This system had reached about 700 protected houses for aquatic agricultural systems over an area of 191,000 sqm by the end of 2012, compared to only 10 locations in 2009. This is thanks to the MOEW's effort to introduce aquatic agriculture technology into the sector. What's more, MOEW has adopted initiatives to contribute to agriculture development, such as the palm initiative. Livestock is also an important issue, and the MOEW works through its 21 veterinary clinics and 60 veterinaries covering all parts of the country to provide treatment, vaccines, and guidance free of charge to animal breeders in order to protect local wealth from disease and enhance its contribution to local production. Regarding food safety, since 80% of the state's foodstuff is imported, the MOEW considers food safety the key priority with a view to circulating sound consumable food products by issuing legislation and resolutions regulating food safety. These include resolutions on control over agricultural and veterinary quarantine points, import prohibition or prohibition lifting resolutions, resolutions regulating animal production farms, and regarding unified work guidelines, including the uniform guide to food prohibition and prohibition lifting procedures. In addition, a federal law on food safety is currently under development.</p><h4>How does the UAE hosting a number of international events related to clean energy, sustainability, and the environment contribute to the country's development?</h4><p>By hosting international conferences and gatherings on the environment, sustainable development, and energy, we reinforce our commitment to participate actively in international endeavors to address the causes of environmental problems and find sustainable solutions to them. The UAE has been approved as a regional and international platform to discuss the main issues nationally, regionally, and internationally. It also highlights the attention of the wise leadership to the issues of the environment, energy, and sustainable development. The contribution of these international conferences and gatherings in enhancing the efforts of sustainable development in the UAE mainly comes in the form of gathering an elite body of leading policy and decision makers, as well as competent officials, in both the public and private sectors. This opens the door to important opportunities for building partnerships, exchanging experiences and perspectives, as well as assessing and building state-of-the-art systems, technologies, and practices; for example, the Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week, Dubai Global Energy Forum, and Abu Dhabi-headquartered International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Looking across the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, we see mega projects everywhere and your agency is tasked with protecting the environment in the face of this development. What does this entail from your side?<br></h4><p>We at the Environment Agency—Abu Dhabi (EAD) aim to ensure that development goes hand-in-hand with environmental conservation. I think that the process of maintaining this delicate balance entails three major components: anticipation, permission, and enforcement. To achieve this, EAD works toward obtaining a strong base of scientific data, raising awareness among relevant target audiences, and subsequently employing effective regulation, as well as monitoring and enforcement. Anticipation is a key principal that guides planning, and environmental planning is one of the core components of Abu Dhabi's development agenda. Our leadership created the Environment and Infrastructure Committee under the Abu Dhabi Executive Council, and our work at EAD is directly linked to theirs. Working to have the necessary infrastructure for development is extremely important from an environmental perspective. For example, anticipation with reference to the demand and supply of utilities and sewerage is extremely important in driving proper infrastructure preparedness. If you lack a proper sewerage system or storm system, the environment, particularly the marine environment, will suffer.</p><h4>Another interesting project in this area is that of solar desalination. How are you implementing this in the remote areas of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>Biodiversity conservation is at the heart of EAD's mission. EAD manages an extensive network of protected areas that are a breeding ground for valuable indigenous species. For example, we have an internationally recognised Arabian Oryx breeding program that has successfully reintroduced this species into the wild. However, this species, and other desert-dwelling indigenous species such as sand and mountain gazelles, have been affected by climate change and decreased natural vegetation, and so we need to lend nature a helping hand. Many of these animals' habitats are extremely remote and have extremely salty groundwater supplies, whereby innovation and R&amp;D are needed to support an environmentally efficient solution to ensure their sustainability. Our plan is to use solar power to desalinate the existing groundwater and provide an oasis-style environment for local biodiversity. We are currently managing 26 sites following a successful pilot scheme. There have been challenges: some of the areas are difficult to access and sand storms are common. It has proven to be a highly useful exercise in water management technology, and also in mapping our Emirate's geography. We continue to learn more about, and fine-tune, this new water management technology which is allowing our biodiversity to flourish again and is creating new habitats in one of the harshest climates on earth.</p><h4>How does the EAD work both here and regionally to arrest the effects of climate change?</h4><p>The EAD invests in scientific research and one of our priorities is understanding the effects of, and mitigating against, climate change. One of our most established programmes is the Blue Carbon Project. This project, run in collaboration with the UN Environmental Program (UNEP) and the Abu Dhabi Global Environmental Data Initiative (AGEDI), was set up in 2002 to study the ability of mangroves in the UAE to absorb CO2 emissions, making it possibly the oldest climate change-linked research study in the region. The EAD has launched an initiative to compile a Greenhouse Gas Inventory, which is a scientific study analysing the Emirate's contribution to greenhouse gas emissions.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What investment opportunities does the opening of Khalifa Industrial Zone Abu Dhabi (Kizad) present for companies operating in the GCC?<br></h4><p>Kizad is part of an initiative to promote industrial development and diversify GDP contributions. It acts as an enabler that allows companies investing in different clusters within Kizad to add tremendous business value through innovation and economies of proximity. Aluminum is one of the key clusters available today at Kizad and opens up diverse downstream potential. In terms of clusters, we have the aluminum, steel, and engineered metal clusters, with logistics, food, and mixed-use clusters also available to investors, providing a variety of industrial activity. There are three key advantages that Kizad provides to companies that have a market within the GCC and are looking to expand, or companies that are interested in the Middle East as a new market. The first is excellent access to global markets. Secondly, we insist on operating a low-cost environment, and finally we make it easy for investors to do business with us. The minute that you are set up in Kizad as an industrial project, you are able to benefit from cost advantages in three areas. The first is that firms are exempt from all customs duties on their capital equipment. During operations, we also exempt companies from customs on the importation of raw materials that come through Khalifa Port. The most significant exemption, though, is finished products. Here, the cost of selling a product includes capital costs, raw materials, operating costs, overheads, and profits, as well as financing costs. If you are within Kizad, we are able to issue a company a certificate exempting it from GCC market taxes like conditions at the Greater Arab Free Trade Area (GAFTA), where companies do not pay any customs duties to do business. This really is a key advantage. The other is that, obviously, there is no taxation of companies or personal income either.</p><h4>What is your current progress on Stage I, and when will Stage II begin?</h4><p>The Stage I and Stage II idea is a highly fluid one. Stage I involves 55% of the area, or 51 square kilometers. We have completed the infrastructure, including that of the adjacent Khalifa Port, which is the first and only semi-automated port in the region and now completely integrated with Kizad. In just one year, Khalifa Port went from a pristine stretch of reclaimed land to a busy hub, serving 17 shipping lines, offering 18 direct services, and connecting more than 40 ports directly. As of October 2013, the container terminal at Khalifa Port handled a record breaking 100,081 TEUs. This is the highest number of containers ever handled in one month at Khalifa Port and the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. In a year-on-year comparison to date, Khalifa Port's container terminal operations are more than 12% higher than in the same period of 2012, with a total throughput of 712,342 TEUs between January and October 2013. Growth hit 27% in October 2013 compared to October 2012. This is a part of our business plan and growth strategy. It also helps with our investors' distribution costs and gives them the connectivity they require. In terms of industrial zones, all of Area A, including the highways, storm water, potable water, combined waste water, seawater cooling, process water, gas networks, and electrical distribution networks—high, medium, and low voltage—are already in place and operational. In terms of backers already establishing facilities at Kizad, we have over 40 investors busy building and preparing their operations for launch in 2014.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you rate the growth of the UAE's defense and aerospace industry in recent years given your insights into the business side of the sector?<br></h4><p>The UAE is a major purchaser of defense and security products and services. It is also committed to diversifying its economy away from a dependence on oil revenues. As a result, it has used offset funding to develop an aerospace hub, as well as precision engineering and munitions facilities. The UAE is now a manufacturer of both composite and precision-engineered metal parts for Boeing and Airbus airframes.</p><h4>How has long-term security cooperation between the UAE and the UK influenced the development of the UAE's own capability to produce defense technology?</h4><p>I think the biggest driver for the UAE is its desire to increase capacity and capability amongst the Emirati population. Security cooperation has inevitably contributed to this via knowledge transfer and joint ventures, but profitability and Emiratization are the biggest drivers.</p><h4>Why should the UAE buy British when it comes to this sector?</h4><p>The UK punches above its weight when it comes to aerospace, advanced engineering, and manufacturing. The Airbus A380 is iconic. The Eurofighter Typhoon is quite simply the best aircraft of its type. When you couple this with the niche technologies developed by both large companies and SMEs, it is no surprise that the UK is second only to the US when it comes to defense sales.</p><div class="quote">“The UAE is now a manufacturer of both composite and precision-engineered metal parts for Boeing and Airbus airframes. "</div><h4>Where do you see the best opportunities for further technical collaboration between UAE and British companies, especially in the aerospace sector?</h4><p>UK companies are global leaders in aerospace research. For example, Bombardier's C-Series aircraft has been designed to reduce fuel consumption. The UAE is seeking to grow an aerospace industry and has achieved an enormous amount in a short time. Collaboration would allow UAE companies to invest alongside their UK counterparts in order to develop the next generation of aerospace technologies.</p><h4>The UAE recently opened a diplomatic mission to NATO; the first Arab country to do so. What potential does this provide for closer commercial ties when it comes to defense cooperation?</h4><p>The UAE military already engages in joint exercises with NATO members, including the UK. Exposure to UK expertise, products, and services could lead to commercial opportunities, and would only serve to enhance our bilateral relationship.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the Abu Dhabi Systems &amp; Information Centre (ADSIC) developed since it was established in late 2005?</h4><p>We began as a committee tasked to modernize Abu Dhabi's services—basically covering all services, infrastructure, and legislation. Then, in 2008, HH General Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan decreed that Abu Dhabi's ICT capabilities and plans be placed under our authority. This meant that we had to act as a regulator, building the standards, policies, and the recommendations for the Executive Council. This mandate for us to move forward turned us into the Emirate's highest ICT authority. We started in 2006 with a solid strategy of slowly laying out the right infrastructure, human capital, and systems in place. We have shifted all these services from 2006 to today, and now have very sophisticated systems for the Abu Dhabi Emirate. We have a government contact center where we have more than 50 integrated entities working around the clock. We have a portal with more than 1,000 services available at any time, in Arabic and English, which provides access to all local government services. This takes all of us to the next step; we don't have to browse for services anymore, we can just conduct transactions remotely or by phone. This is the modernization we have been envisioning for government. We currently link more than 95 entities together, integrating them all under a single platform. We have another initiative that we call the “security program," where we propose the framework and help entities to accommodate it. We intend to move forward beyond our achievements to date, though. We are now working with the entities to increase their maturity. When you think of our data center today, we are acting on behalf of the government in terms of ICT, and so we are helping manage the local IT budget.</p><h4>How can an e-government platform create opportunities for the private sector?</h4><p>One of the pillars of the Abu Dhabi government's e-government strategy is strengthening partnerships with the private sector. In this regard, we are working closely with the private sector to provide solid support. For example, some companies are collaborating with government to perform the latter's tasks. The government introduces the policies and the framework and then lets the private sector participate and deliver what it can.</p><h4>What have been the challenges of this e-government strategy?</h4><p>There have been various challenges, such as people preferring to stick with the traditional way of doing things. There are some who insist on paper-based transactions done over the counter; others have become comfortable going online, however. It is a cultural factor that will take time to settle in. Next-generation people such as elementary and secondary students are already using smart phones and devices and don't imagine any other way of doing things. They have been asking how they can execute their transactions online. For such cases, we are working closely with Etisalat to reduce internet usage costs. We are basically encouraging more people to use online services.</p><h4>How is the ICT sector contributing to the Abu Dhabi Economic Vision 2030?</h4><p>Today's ICT sector has two dimensions. One is the creation of opportunities. By this, I mean the opening of new facilities and businesses, which IT can actively participate in, such as Mubadala's foray into semi-conductors and Masdar's heavy involvement with ICT. This is one of our strategies moving forward. We are also an enabler, and so we want to enhance theability of ICT to help industries meettheirrequirements. We have a single file for all medical records, for example, and this is where the ICT sector can participate. Education is another sector that can benefit from our ICT platform, as we can help deliver curriculum or monitor students online.</p><h4>How important is inter-Emirate cooperation to your strategies, and how do you transfer knowledge?</h4><p>I was part of the process of developing the strategy for the UAE. I am working with another board member to ensure we are aligning things properly. Today, we are trying to share whatever we have here to the other emirates.</p><h4>What organizations do you work with to develop your strategy?</h4><p>We have an international partnership with Oracle, Microsoft, and the Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI), which is involved with Geographic Information Systems. ESRI is based in San Diego and leads the world in that sector. We partner with many other key service providers. The good thing is that we do not discuss such matter as a center. Rather, we talk about them on behalf of the government and the entities we serve.</p><h4>How do you partner with universities in Abu Dhabi to promote Emiratization?</h4><p>We are working closely with the Tawteen Council as it is one of the main engines helping people move to the next step. The Council does not just focus on the hiring of people; it encourages skill-building as well. We have a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with all of Abu Dhabi's universities and colleges. We are also running a program called e-citizens, which is not just for government employees, but also for those who lag behind in terms of internet usage. This is one of the initiatives that the government focuses on to educate the public, not just its employees. Citizens need ICT to utilize important government services. One of our successful projects is the training of more than 600 people, of which 350 passed the internationally accredited exam. The successful candidates can now register online, book tickets, send emails, and browse the internet, whereas before they didn't know how to.</p><h4>What goals have you completed, and what are you aiming for over 2014?</h4><p>The journey toward e-government and Emiratization is endless. There is always an enhancement, a change, or an update required. Our program has more than 35 ongoing related activities. Some of these have been completed in terms of their infrastructure. The Abu Dhabi Network is being completed, and our government data center is ready, as well as our gateway for the Abu Dhabi government. Jobs Abu Dhabi is up and running with private sector participation. These are the milestones of our journey as a center, but there is still some work that every sector must deliver. Every sector wants a one-stop shop at the Department of Economic Development. This is an initiative that we have articulated, and forwarded to the Department for implementation. We have deployed the requisite infrastructure, connected the entities, and now the system works perfectly. There are also many projects related to tourism. All of these programs are being overseen by ADSIC to ICT-enable the various services out there.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your management priorities?<br></h4><p>My role is to guarantee that our satellites function correctly and that we provide first-class satellite communications to a variety of sectors. As part of my job, I also look at how to expand the business, consider which markets we can enter and which potential products we can introduce. As we are a young company, we place great importance on this process. With an already successful regional presence, we are now looking at a number of ways to continue expanding the organization's footprint on a global level.</p><h4>Can you tell us about YahClick?</h4><p>YahClick—the satellite broadband internet service—is our flagship product, providing high-speed and reliable internet to businesses, home users, NGOs, and government entities across the Middle East, Africa, South West, and Central Asia.  We have already launched in 13 of our target total of 28 markets. YahClick will be fully operational across all 28 markets in 2014. Our priority markets are in South Africa, Afghanistan, Nigeria, Angola, and Iraq. We have also launched beyond these markets to include Tanzania, Yemen, South Sudan, Pakistan, and Uganda. YahClick is only one of the four services that Yahsat offers. The others are YahLive, which is DTH through our joint venture with SES; YahLink, the backhauling on C Band managed services; and YahService, which is the business service entity that deals with all government relationships and contracts.</p><h4>How do you find the right human resources for these different operations?</h4><p>We have talent inside the company with great potential, which is augmented thorough the international expertise that we brought here to assist in establishing the company. In terms of recruitment, our staff range from a mixture of homegrown talent to invaluable industry experts from other global operators. We have an Emiratization rate of about 54%, and specifically in the satellite operations area this reaches 58% nationalization, something that we are very proud of. Within our satellite operations team, we have staff trained over the past three years to fully manage satellite operations.</p><h4>Who do you liaise with in terms of national universities?</h4><p>The human capital (HC) team and the communication team are working together to make sure that we have enough events, what they call the “pull factor" for recruitment. They talk to universities like Khalifa University, AUS, Zayed University, and Higher Colleges of Technology (HCT). We place a huge emphasis on working at ground level with the students so they have first-hand experience of working in a sector like ours. This can be done through career fairs, which is one thing, but having a continuous and deep relationship that the HC team is managing will give you the extra pull to attract talent. We hold a number of internships, including in 2013 when we hosted four students from the HCT, Abu Dhabi Women's College as part of ongoing internship program. The four students were placed within our technical department and were given both theory and practical experience.</p><h4>Would you say that developing the human resources capacity is one of the long-term benefits of having a company like Yahsat?</h4><p>If you talk about the satellite industry, the satellite operators, you have the FSS represented by Yahsat, the MSS represented by Thuraya, and the Earth Observation represented by EIAST. In this environment, you have enough room to maneuver if you brought in, and developed, a good talent pool. Definitely, the long-term goal is to develop talent for the country. However, it is difficult to assess the efficacy of these processes unless we empower employees to perform the desired functions, and achieving the required subjectivity is a challenge.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does the opening of the new Khalifa Port signify for Abu Dhabi?<br></h4><p>It marks a new era, and a new phase in social and economic development. Until Mina Zayed, access to Abu Dhabi's economy had been limited. There were no means of transportation other than overland or by air. Mina Zayed signaled the first signs of significant economic growth. Then, Khalifa Port was opened due to capacity growth and urban planning issues, as port infrastructure had to relocate. Over the past four to five years, compound growth has accelerated. Considering Abu Dhabi in 2005-2006, it increased to around 250,000 TEUs a year. Over the past six years, measured annual compound growth has seen more than a 20% annual increase. It is somewhat disconnected from the global economic environment and is largely driven by successful economic policies. The different sectors that we are actively involved in—tourism, oil and gas, steel, and transport, to name a few—are driving investment in infrastructure and also into the establishment of basic industries. Previously, everything was imported and nothing was made locally. Yet, today, our industries are starting to produce steel, plastic, aluminum, and pharmaceuticals. Growth is driven by exports rather than imports. Our productivity is higher per crane, per unit, and per hour than that of a normal, traditional manual port. We turn trucks around much faster than any other port in the region. It takes us just 15 minutes or so to get a truck in, loaded, and out—a normal port would take around 1-2 hours. By going to Khalifa Port, you can deploy a truck 10 times a day, so you can move 10 containers instead of two. For trucking companies, this means increased revenues and optimized assets.</p><h4>What trends have you noticed in the amount of export cargo handling in recent years?</h4><p>In addition to a solid 20% growth rate for several years, we are still growing now despite the fact that most countries around us have contracted. More is produced here so there are fewer finished products and more raw materials being imported. We see bulk cargo increasing, and we see exports on containers increasing because more products are being made here and exported. At the same time, because of active investment in infrastructure, there is more project cargo, such as heat exchanges, pipes, and other large goods used to build factories or power plants.</p><h4>Abu Dhabi terminals recently reached an agreement to offer a direct link to India; what does this mean for Khalifa Port?</h4><p>There has been historic trade between the UAE and India. It is necessary for us to have direct connections there from Khalifa Port and back just to support trade here. Every time we expand the amount of destinations we reach from the port, we enhance the network. The bigger the network, the more attractive we are as a port.</p><h4>How will Khalifa Port contribute to Abu Dhabi's Vision 2030?</h4><p>There is a policy of diversifying the economy away from oil and gas dependency. If you look at the GDP figures over 2012, non-oil GDP has been growing much faster than oil GDP, so it is working. We are growing industries that were not here before. The port was only there to serve the local market in the past. Now, we are building a business, which is not only related to Abu Dhabi, but other destinations as well—in a word, transshipment. There is a lot of revenue that the port will drive that was not captive for Abu Dhabi before. We are contributing to the sector already.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role will Etihad Rail play in supporting Abu Dhabi's developing industrial sector?<br></h4><p>Modern transport infrastructure is a key element in facilitating the international competitiveness of a country's industrial sector. Etihad Rail's state-of-the-art network has been carefully designed to serve the key industrial sectors in the country as well as the new industrial zones such as the Khalifa Industrial Zone Abu Dhabi (Kizad), and to link these directly with our major ports to provide an efficient means of transporting large volumes of raw materials, and intermediate and finished products. Our 1,200-kilometer network will be ideally located to serve, among others, customers in the oil and gas, metals, aggregates, cement, and waste industries. We have already signed 15 memorandums of understanding (MoUs) with future customers and partners who anticipate the improvements that rail will bring to their logistics operations.</p><h4>In terms of transportation, how will Etihad Rail contribute to the shift away from oil and gas dependency?</h4><p>The railway will facilitate the diversification of economic activity by providing the non-oil industrial sector with a safe, secure, reliable, and efficient means of transporting large volumes of goods to customers within the UAE, to and from its ports, and on to other GCC countries, thereby helping to reduce logistics costs and increasing the competitiveness on the world market of goods produced in the UAE. Etihad Rail has been working with the relevant authorities and port operating companies to ensure the rail network enhances the efficiency of logistics chains, for example by connecting as close as possible to the UAE's ports to eliminate costly double handling and storage of freight.</p><h4>How closely is Etihad Rail working with other governments, regulators, and operators in the GCC to plan the connection of the wider GCC network?</h4><p>The GCC railway has the full backing of the federal and local governments in the UAE as well as of the governments of other GCC countries. Etihad Rail is an active participant in GCC committees and working groups, facilitated by the GCC Secretariat General, with the aim of ensuring that the GCC national networks are operationally interoperable, have similar train signaling systems and compatible customs processes, and offer a regulatory environment that stimulates commercial growth. We have already agreed on the key common technical standards that each railway must adopt and these are already built into Etihad Rail's designs. We are now discussing the operational, institutional, and regulatory arrangements that need to be put in place at the GCC level.</p><div class="quote">“Each train will comprise of three diesel locomotives pulling approximately 100 hopper wagons. "</div><h4>Etihad Rail is currently completing Stage I, connecting Shah and Habshan to Ruwais. What is the size of this project and when is it expected to be completed?</h4><p>Trains will be used to transport granulated sulfur from the granulation plants at Habshan and Shah to the export loading facility at Ruwais. Stage I of the Etihad Rail network will extend 153 kilometers from Habshan to Ruwais and 264 kilometers from Shah to Ruwais, facilitating an efficient, safe, and environmentally friendly means of transporting the sulfur. Each train will comprise of three diesel locomotives pulling approximately 100 hopper wagons. There will be one train per day from both loading points to the port. Each hopper wagon can carry 100 tons, and thus each 100 wagon train will carry about 10,000 tons per day. In turn, each train will eliminate approximately 300 trucks from the highway system. Construction on Stage I is well advanced, with the Habshan-Ruwais route scheduled for launch by the end of 2013, with the Shah-Habshan route to follow in 2014.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA) is tasked with ensuring that the UAE becomes a regional ICT hub. How would you evaluate your performance so far?</h4><p>The TRA is building the core ICT regulatory framework for the UAE's burgeoning knowledge economy, and regulates the UAE's telecommunications sector to ensure that competition provides affordable and reliable telecommunications services. The TRA licensed Emirates Integrated Telecommunications Corporation (du) as the UAE's second national operator in 2006. Since commencing service delivery in 2007, du has largely focused on the mobile communications market and, by the end of 2012, it had secured almost 50% of the mobile market in terms of subscriber numbers. The positive effects of competition in the UAE telecommunications sector are now being witnessed by customers, who enjoy some of the lowest mobile tariffs in the GCC. In terms of fixed-line telecommunications services, the UAE has some of the most advanced networks in the world with a very high penetration of fiber to home connections over which the licensees deliver innovative triple-play (voice, internet, and TV) services to customers. The policies of the TRA and the advanced networks deployed in the UAE enable modern UAE society to function with a high level of connectivity and affordable and reliable telecommunications services. In short, I am proud of the TRA's performance so far.</p><h4>Many internet users still connect by dial-up because of the prices attached to broadband plans. Is there an opportunity here for regulation to improve services and prices for consumers?</h4><p>The TRA supervises the development of the UAE's online infrastructure has enabled it to become one of the world's most connected societies with 72% of households having access to broadband internet. The TRA is working closely with the licensees to implement a form of network sharing known as bit stream access. This will increase competition in the fixed services market and exert downward pressure on a range of fixed-line services, including broadband.</p><h4>The TRA has been running the My Number, My Identity program over past few months. Could you tell us a little bit about the program, and why it is encouraged?</h4><p>This campaign is in line with our continuous efforts to protect the interests and privacy of mobile users, and is based on studies and surveys that indicated an increase in civil and criminal cases. These are due to certain mobile subscribers giving away their SIM cards to other users who may misuse the number, resulting in serious legal or financial issues for the actual owners. The TRA took several steps to organize registration processes and requirements for mobile phone services provided by the two licensees. The TRA launched the My Number, My Identity campaign in collaboration with the licensees, aiming to increase awareness of the new registration procedures. The campaign highlights the importance of the mobile subscribers' role in protecting their SIM cards.</p><div class="quote">“The UAE's online infrastructure has enabled it to become one of the world's most connected societies. "</div><h4>The TRA has encouraged telecoms providers to introduce mobile number portability (MNP). Why is this important?</h4><p>MNP will allow the customers to retain their mobile number when switching network operators, granting them the freedom to choose their preferred network operator without worrying about their number changing. At the same time, MNP will enhance competition among network operators, and hence enhance services. MNP will be to the benefit of the end customer in general.</p><h4>At a 2013 GCC meeting, the TRA proposed the creation of the .arab domain name. What potential does this have?</h4><p>The internet today has labels representing countries. The League of Arab States and the TRA envision .arab to serve the entire Arab region. It will create new opportunities for businesses and individuals unifying us on the internet. We are at the birth of a new era and are poised to fully support it. We believe .arab has very strong potential for success.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[say-hello-to-seha]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the overall goal and strategy of Abu Dhabi Health Services Company (SEHA)?</h4><p>It goes back to 2006 when the government of Abu Dhabi hired McKinsey &amp; Company to look at the health sector and how healthcare was provided, how financing was done, and the level of health coverage for the population. It was a major study and one key recommendation was that the provision of healthcare, funding, and regulation of healthcare should be separated into three autonomous organizations. The Health Authority of Abu Dhabi (HAAD) was formed to deal with regulation, Daman as the national health insurance company, and SEHA as the provider of public health services. Our job was to own and operate all of the government's healthcare assets. We combined them in one organization that became operational in January 2008. We own the assets, land, buildings, equipment, vendor contracts, and all the employment agreements. The objective was to instill the discipline of a private company—in terms of accountability—to stakeholders, and the production of financial statements and budgets, through a legally private, albeit 100% government-owned, company.</p><h4>Do you observe rising trust in health services?</h4><p>I do feel that there is a rising level of confidence, but one of our biggest challenges remains winning back the credibility lost in the years prior to SEHA. This takes time, and receives our constant efforts. The issue of people going abroad is not an area of responsibility for SEHA; this falls under the purview of the HAAD, but if you break the data down, there are many reasons why people go abroad. One reason is the local lack of certain services that would require unique and specialized physicians. It is simple to assemble the infrastructure, but the physician and ancillary staff to come are another, challenging, matter. Secondly, we might have the service, but lack client confidence. We have an immense potential to improve our offering and reduce the number of people looking abroad for treatment. This remains one of our key goals in assisting the government.</p><h4>How do you bring international standards to the workforce and transfer knowledge to locals?</h4><p>On the clinical front it begins with education. We do not run medical or nursing schools, but one requires special qualifications to work for us. Not enough Emiratis are pursuing medical careers, and so we have started a promotion campaign at high schools, for instance, while working with the Tawteen Council and other Emirati organizations on this. Secondly, we provide post-academic training at our hospitals. Once nurses graduate, we offer structured, formal graduate nurse training to help develop sub-specializations and round off their education in a practical setting. We do the same thing for physicians through residency programs. We recently received ACGMEI Accreditation for these residency programs, so now when our physicians complete the program they have better-documented educational provision through which to become specialist doctors. Today, less than 2% of our nurses are Emiratis, while almost 22% of our doctors are as a direct result of these training programs. We have looked long term at where our Emiratization rates will be in 2030 regarding doctors, nurses, and allied health professionals, and I doubt that we could exceed the 20% mark. There are only so many Emiratis pursuing clinical work. Our longer-term goal is in the 20% range for the clinical side of our business. On the administrative side, we have very structured programs for the senior management. We work with them on a mentoring basis, involving considerable on-the-job and structured training to enhance leadership skills. As a result, the percentage of Emirati administrative personnel has risen from about 33% to over 50%, and we anticipate a 75% rate by 2030.</p><div class="quote">“We will be opening a new Mafraq Hospital in 2015, and are set to replace the Al Ain Hospital.  "</div><h4>Are there opportunities for further international partnerships?</h4><p>We are changing our model for partnering with international organizations. Initially, we started partnering at the hospital level. For example, when we took over Mafraq Hospital, we partnered with a Thai company. We partnered Al Ain Hospital with an Austrian company, while Sheikh Khalifa Medical City was partnered with the Cleveland Clinic, and we partnered Tawam Hospital, Corniche Hospital, and Al Rahba Hospital with Johns Hopkins. When SEHA was established, we had few management and system tools, and so one of the reasons for these partnerships was to rapidly advance our ability to implement computer systems and accounting regimes. Instead of partnering at the hospital level, we are asking these organizations to partner with us in treating a patient population of medical services. They will no longer be management contracts, but are migrating to clinical affiliation agreements. We will work with Johns Hopkins, for example, to clinically support our women's health services across all of our hospitals and clinics. They will not manage our hospitals, but will help us clinically support managing a population of medical services. We have identified 15 of these clinical service lines and, of those, we will partner five or six with international organizations. We are currently tendering pediatrics, having identified seven or eight top organizations whose response we await. Over the next three or four years, we will be working with existing partners to migrate from these hospital-specific to clinical, population-specific contracts. We are also in discussions with Cleveland Clinic.</p><h4>In the short term, what will we see in Abu Dhabi in terms of the standard of healthcare and the kind of facilities available?</h4><p>First of all, many of our hospitals are 30 or 40 years old and are being replaced. We will be opening a new Mafraq Hospital in 2015, and are set to replace the Al Ain Hospital. We are building and expanding hospitals in the Western Region. A new Corniche Hospital will be developed on the campus of the new Sheikh Khalifa Medical City. We have already done much in the outpatient setting, and also for dialysis care. We have opened the new Mafraq Dialysis Center, as well as one at Tawam and another at Sheikh Khalifa Medical City. The facilities side is well planned with a six-year road map in place. The real challenge is getting the right staff to make that difference, and so we must boost the skills of our current workforce. We need more physician consultants to upgrade the skills of our GPs, and obtain more nurses specially trained in areas such as neo-natal, pediatric, and surgical intensive care. Care quality is directly related to the number of nurse and physician hours per patient, which we are constantly improving. We have systems in place to monitor clinical outcomes that allow the monitoring of our performance.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What do the UAE government's plans to increase oil production to 3.5 million from 2.7 million barrels per day (bbl/d) by 2017 mean for OPEC in terms of maintaining a reliable supply to consumer nations?<br></h4><p>For many decades, the UAE has helped meet the world's oil needs through exploring, producing, refining, and transporting these precious natural resources, both at home and internationally. Today, with around 100 billion barrels of proven crude oil reserves and close to 3% of current global production, the UAE is one of the world's leading oil and energy hubs. Its current investment plans reinforce its commitment to meeting its consumers' needs. And there is no doubt the world will need more oil in the years ahead, with demand expected to rise by around 19 million bbl/d by 2035. And with the bulk of this demand increase coming from Asia, the UAE is also ideally positioned geographically as the global energy axis shifts to the East. Combined with investments in other OPEC member countries, the organization is demonstrating the seriousness it attaches to the need for adequate production capacity to be in place, not only to meet demand for its oil, but also to offer sufficient spare capacity.</p><h4>What are the ramifications of increased North American hydrocarbon production and the development of its tight oil reserves for OPEC's GCC members in terms of production targets, pricing, and upstream investment over the coming decade?</h4><p>Over the past couple of years there has evidently been increasing media focus on North American tight oil production. I think it is important to stress that these supplies are a welcome addition to the global supply outlook, and, at the same time, that they provide further proof to consumers that the world is not running out of oil. Of course, people have asked how these developments might impact other producers, such as GCC member states. To date, it has been relatively minimal. Yes, the US is producing more and importing less than a few years ago. It's true, too, that some producers have lost market share in the US, but we should put these developments into some context. Firstly, we need to remember that global demand is close to 90 million bbl/d, and with demand set to expand further there is room for all producers. And secondly, we need to see how sustainable this type of tight oil production is in the long term. For example, the industry is already seeing tight oil fields reach a production plateau after a year or so and then witness a steep decline rate. There have been reports that shale wells can drop off by more than 60% within the first year. In addition, there are also environmental concerns, and when looking globally, questions remain as to whether US developments can be replicated elsewhere. As it has done for many decades, OPEC and its member countries will continue to monitor the market on a daily basis, and make sure production and future investments are in-line with how we see the market in the coming months and years.</p><h4>How does OPEC support clean energy initiatives and diversification efforts such as the recently built Shams 1 solar power plant in the Western Region of the UAE?</h4><p>Obviously, oil and gas remains central to the economies of OPEC member countries, and this will be true for the foreseeable future. However, many are now also investing in clean energy initiatives and making huge efforts to protect the environment, as well as diversifying their economies to reduce their reliance on oil and gas. For example, in the petroleum sector, many companies are supplying cleaner projects and investing in technologies such as carbon capture and storage, and in other energies, such as solar and wind power.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Abu Dhabi is diversifying its economy away from oil and gas. What potential do you see in the sector and what trends are you observing?<br></h4><p>There are two trends in this area that present TAQA with opportunities. On the one hand, Abu Dhabi is indeed in the process of diversifying its economy, while on the other hand the whole world is wrestling with its fuel mix. It is part of Abu Dhabi's vision for 2030, and the Emirate recognizes that the age of fossil fuels will end, and is planning for that world today. The process of moving the economy away from primary commodity exports at the same time as the world wrestles with its fuel mix brings a set of opportunities. We are in a unique position because not only do we have those scaled businesses in other markets, but also we are present throughout the value chain. Part of our mission is that we are scale players in all our businesses in other markets, and we are owner-operators of these businesses; thus we have large operating businesses in the rest of the world. We are the largest UAE investor in Ghana, Morocco, the Netherlands, the UK, and Canada. We have large businesses in the oil and gas and power sectors, where the license to operate is a crucial element because these businesses are capital intensive, highly regulated, and of significant importance to the host government.</p><h4>What role will TAQA play in the signing of a deal between the UAE and Turkish governments to develop energy plants and mines in Turkey?</h4><p>The inter-government agreement has been signed. Underlying that is a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between TAQA and EÜAÅž, which is the government-owned Turkish energy generating company. Together, we will develop power plants in the Afşin-Elbistan basin in south-central Turkey, where there is a huge lignite deposit. It probably has sufficient fuel to produce 7,000 MW-10,000 MW of power. We will start by buying an existing plant, the Afşin-Elbistan Plant B, which is a 1,440 MW lignite burner currently in operation. Over time, we will build a series of plants. There is a total potential in the region for 11,000 MW of capacity, but we are not committed to that. Our role in Turkey is to buy the first plant and develop around it as is feasible. We have looked at Turkey for a long time, and like the growth dynamics there.</p><h4>Which of TAQA's high-profile series of global acquisitions are most significant, and how would you evaluate their quality?</h4><p>Over the past three to four years, we have devoted ourselves to essentially disposing of what we foresee as non-performing assets and channeling that money into our other businesses. We have spent our time concentrating on our portfolio and then devoting our time developing organic projects. We are spending about $2 billion a year on capital expenditure (CAPEX) in projects within our existing businesses. Between 2010 and 2014, we will spend about $10 billion in total on developing projects inside our existing portfolio—drilling in western Canada, the UK's North Sea, the Bergermeer gas storage project in the Netherlands, the Jorf Lasfar power plant expansion project in Morocco, and our Takoradi expansion in Ghana. These are our five major spending programs. They are all developing value-accruing projects within our existing footprint. The focus of the company changed when I took over, shifting the strategy from growth by acquisition to stabilizing the business and developing value opportunities. Now we are four years into that five-year program, and are starting to see that spending turn into revenue. The free cash flow dynamic has started to change dramatically. We have focused more strategically on our country's entry into Turkey and Iraq, while stabilizing the North Sea business and generally trying to develop our future business opportunities around three factors. The first is what Abu Dhabi brings to this; for example, is there something that we have the ability to trade as a government-related entity of the Emirate? Secondly, do we have existing business synergies? And, thirdly, do we have the resources? Where those three circles intersect will be the sweet spot on our strategy map.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Phase II expansion progressed?</h4><p>The Phase II expansion is already well ahead of schedule. In September 2013, the First Hot Metal (FHM) was cut into the first pot of the line, which is the longest single pot line in the world at 1.7 kilometers. FHM was delivered three months ahead of schedule. Once completed the total annual production capacity will rise to 1.3 million tons, making Emirates Aluminium (EMAL) one of the largest single-site aluminum smelters in the world. The construction of Phase II has exceeded the already exemplary standards achieved in the construction of Phase I, setting new global industry records in the process. Phase II has achieved FHM a full four months faster than Phase I, delivering 20% more value in dollar/ton investment, whilst maintaining an incredible zero lost time through injury (LTI) record representing 40 million man-hours of work done, which is testament to the strength of our commitment to “safety first, last, and always." Taking just two years, it is also the fastest time in which any aluminum smelter has reached FHM.</p><h4>What does this mean in terms of scale, engineering innovation, and special industrial achievements, including UAE-developed reduction cell technology?</h4><p>Completed three months earlier than scheduled, the milestone FHM marks the start of production for EMAL's Phase II, as it heads toward a total production of 1.3 million metric tons of aluminum a year. Reaching FHM safer, faster, and better not only exceeds the successes achieved in Phase I, but highlights the ability of Emirati excellence to set new industry standards on a global scale. The achievements of Phase II are impressive. Stretching 1.7 kilometers, EMAL Phase II has the longest pot line in the world, consisting of 444 reduction pots built with Dubai Aluminum (DUBAL) for their cathode bus ring. Using DUBAL developed DX+ technology, Phase II operates with the highest amperage in the region at 440 KA, which is built to creep in the future to reach 460 KA. Among its world leading credentials, EMAL now possesses the largest single site production capacity at 1.3 million tons of aluminum/year; the world's longest pot line ever built; the world's largest gas treatment center; the world's biggest anode baking furnace; the biggest single-site captive power plant; the highest single line capacity green anode manufacturing plant; and is the first to use 2,000 V rectifier/transformers. EMAL also has one of the largest single-site cast houses, with a 1.65 million ton/year casting capacity.</p><h4>How has the sophistication of logistics services at Khalifa Port helped meet the deadlines of this project phase?</h4><p>On the occasion of the official inauguration of Khalifa Port by Abu Dhabi Ports Company (ADPC) in December 2012, we embarked on a new era in EMAL's contributing role to the diversification of the UAE economy, making the first export shipment of finished product to international customers from our dedicated EMAL berth in Khalifa Port. The milestone export of 28 shipping containers of finished standard ingot products left the port to EMAL customers in Japan and Vietnam. EMAL currently supplies over 150 customers around the globe with high-quality, ISO 9001 certified aluminum, which is available as sow, standard ingots, sheet ingots, foundry ingots, and extrusion billets. Sow and standard ingots are traded on the London Metal Exchange. First opened in November 2010, the purpose built EMAL wharf at Khalifa Port has enabled delivery of raw materials directly direct from sea to smelter. To be shipping quality Emirati produced aluminum using Emirati-developed DX+ Reduction Cell Technology direct from the smelter via a dedicated berth places us in good stead to further establish EMAL as a major new player in the global aluminum market.</p><h4>The price of aluminum hit a four-year low when it dipped below $1,800 a ton in late June 2013. What effect did this have on the implementation of Phase II, and what are your expectations for demand and pricing over the next five years?</h4><p>In 2012, primary aluminum production by GCC smelters was at 3.6 million tons, which constituted around 8% of total world production. GCC countries are consolidating their leading position primarily by increasing their annual productivity and adding new capacity, while adopting the latest advanced technologies. Production capacity in the region is set to rise by 40% to almost 5 million metric tons by 2015 and this trend is set to continue with forecasters estimating the GCC will be responsible for almost one-fifth of the world's aluminum production, excluding China, by 2020. This increased capacity will help meet the expected growth in demand for aluminum, which is forecast to rise by 6% year on year over the next decade. Current annual demand for aluminum is at 40 million tons; this is estimated to exceed 70 million by the year 2020. EMAL is well placed to meet the future demand for aluminum internationally, regionally, and locally.</p><h4>What is EMAL's approach to the environment, energy conservation, and what technology does it employ to minimize emissions?</h4><p>EMAL has been committed to preserving the environment since its inception, embracing the protection of the environment as one of its core values. The tone of our approach was decided from the outset when we conducted a translocation exercise of local flora and fauna before construction started. We also go beyond what is merely required and voluntarily conduct activities such as the constant monitoring of the sea temperature close to the smelter. Our key initiatives in pursuit of this core value include: use of the best available technology; encouraging all employees and contractors to comply with EHS policy; creating a culture of environmental awareness for all business activity; and reducing waste and energy use. EMAL has invested more than $700 million in state-of-the-art technologies in Phase I for reducing emissions. As a result, only 13% of waste is sent to landfill, while 46% of all hazard waste is recycled. Roof vent emissions are below EIA range and in 2012 hydrogen fluoride is at 0.07 kg/ton (compared to minimum requirement of 0.12) and total fluoride emissions are 0.13 kg/ton (compared to minimum of 0.18). EMAL complies with all applicable environmental legislation and committed to European standards.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does the renewal of major oil and gas concessions in Abu Dhabi in 2014 mean for British energy companies, and why should the UK be seen as a partner of choice for this sector?<br></h4><p>The importance of the UAE to the worldwide energy market is well known. Abu Dhabi accounts for over 90% of UAE crude oil production, and there are plans to increase production capacity from 2.7 million to 3.7 million barrels per day by 2018. Much of the existing infrastructure will be in need of renewal to meet this target, and so an investment of approximately $20 billion is expected in the near future. Having been established in Abu Dhabi since 1939, and with a worldwide reputation for their expertise, UK energy companies are well positioned to contribute to, and benefit from, this expansion. When coupled with Abu Dhabi's renewable and nuclear energy programs, companies across the sector can benefit from our growing energy partnership with the UAE.</p><h4>What opportunities does the opening of the Khalifa Industrial Zone Abu Dhabi (Kizad) present for UK companies, and what is your impression of the growth of industry across the Emirate of Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>Increased investment in Abu Dhabi has brought numerous opportunities for UK businesses, not only in industry per se, but throughout the supply chains of all related infrastructure. Indeed, prominent among the high value opportunities identified by UK trade and investment are UAE's urban development and infrastructure projects. December 12, 2012, represented a milestone for the UAE and Abu Dhabi with the inauguration of Khalifa Port. Situated next to the Khalifa Industrial Zone, it will be central to the Emirate's 2030 plan to boost trade volumes and diversify the economy. The industrial zone will offer UK companies access to local, regional, and international markets in an environment designed to simplify doing business. There are also significant investments and opportunities in the likes of transport infrastructure. The UAE plans to invest £15 billion in airport expansions over the next five years to provide a total capacity of over 300 million passengers per year, while Abu Dhabi's Etihad Railway is fast-tracking construction of its freight transport project, with the first section of the $11 billion federal rail network nearly completed. The Department of Transport in Abu Dhabi is shortly expected to tender a £12.5 billion metro and light rail project to service a population expected to rise to 2.6 million by 2030.</p><h4>The UAE's largest sharia-compliant bank, Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank, opened its first London office in 2012. Do you anticipate more UAE investment outside of the energy sector in the UK and if so, where are the opportunities?</h4><p>I welcome the Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank expanding its operations in London. The market for Islamic finance is growing rapidly; with global Islamic investments soaring by 150% since 2006, they are expected to be worth £1.3 trillion in 2014. In October 2013, London became the first city outside of the Islamic world to host the World Islamic Economic Forum, which highlights our place as a world-leader in the field, with over 20 UK banks offering Islamic financial products and services—more than in any other Western country. The UK appreciates the contribution that FDI makes to our shared prosperity. Abu Dhabi continues to be a major investor in the UK energy market; recently, this has taken the form of substantial interest in renewable industries, such as the £460 million invested in the London Array offshore wind farm. There are further opportunities for UK-Abu Dhabi exchange in numerous sectors outside of financial services and energy.</p><div class="quote">“The market for Islamic finance is growing rapidly; with global Islamic investments soaring by 150% since 2006.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Abu Dhabi is quickly becoming one of the world's top business destinations. What factors lend credibility to the Emirate as an international business hub?</h4><p>Abu Dhabi is one of the world's most modern capital cities and offers a vibrant business environment with secure living conditions. Guided by the Abu Dhabi Economic Vision 2030, the economy has reduced its reliance on the oil sector and laid greater emphasis on knowledge-based industries. At the same time, there is considerable effort being made to leverage the Emirate's substantial resources and experiences in the energy sector by investing in an evolving world energy market that is increasingly looking to renewable energy. Modern logistics infrastructure and new industrial zones have been created to support this heightened economic activity. As a result, Abu Dhabi is today seen as a leading business hub and gateway for global players, and is attracting investment from all over the world.</p><h4>How has the Federal government's economic policy changed as a result of the global financial crisis?</h4><p>The UAE was not immune to international and regional economic developments following the global financial crisis due to the open nature of its economy and the UAE being an important supplier of oil to the rest of the world. However, this did not derail our policy of economic diversification. Instead, the UAE government has been aggressively pursuing its diversification strategy into non-oil, high-value manufacturing and service sectors. Our policy has been to stay focused on the path of innovation and partnerships, which we have identified as essential elements in building the nation's competitiveness.</p><h4>How will the UAE government's announcement of an unprecedented economic expansion of more than AED100 billion worth of public and private projects improve the economy?</h4><p>Economic diversification has opened new avenues for investment in the UAE, with the non-oil sector contributing 68.7% of the UAE's GDP in 2011. The core focus will be on the industries of the future—transport, logistics, hospitality, tourism, and renewable energy—which will drive employment generation and economic development. Besides, a raft of new projects in social infrastructure, health, and education will make the UAE one of the best places to live and work. Together, these projects will pave the way for the creation of a sustainable economy.</p><div class="quote">“FDI inflow into the country is estimated to have surged 21% to $9 billion in 2012. "</div><h4>How has the privatization of certain government services improved competency levels and allowed the government to concentrate on other key areas?</h4><p>Privatization of government services has shifted a significant component of government activity to the private sector. By including the private sector in the development process, the government has not only been able to keep the money flowing within the domestic economy, which has reflected positively on the overall economy. The initiative has also helped revive the internal investment process. As a result, while on the one hand the economy has become more competitive, on the other the government is better placed to focus on major areas of development activity.</p><h4>Is there a risk that high levels of government spending will crowd out the private sector?</h4><p>The UAE's economic situation is in no way discouraging private investment or leading to higher costs of borrowing for consumers and businesses. On the contrary, the UAE has created an attractive business environment that provides investors stability and wide room for growth of their businesses as well as many other benefits. That is why today the UAE is the regional headquarters of over 25% of the top 500  companies in the world. It also ranked the 23rd easiest place to do business, moving three places up, out of 189 countries worldwide on the World Bank's Doing Business 2014 report. Furthermore, it stands out first in the region and fourth in the world in the IMF's Ease of Doing Business Index.</p><h4>What is the UAE government's strategy to boost FDI in the Northern Emirates?</h4><p>The Northern Emirates hold plenty of opportunities for development activities, particularly for oil, engineering, and construction firms. The UAE is a leading FDI destination, and FDI inflow into the country is estimated to have surged 21% to $9 billion in 2012  from $7.6 billion in the previous year. Currently, major infrastructure projects are underway across the Northern Emirates and the government welcomes FDI activities that match local development requirements.</p><h4>In order to maintain a sustainable economy, how important is it for Emiratis to seek employment in the private sector?</h4><p>Sustainable economic development will not be possible in any economy without the engagement of the local population in the realization of economic goals. The UAE Vision 2021 envisages a sustainable economy in which UAE citizens will carve out their future in a spirit of entrepreneurship and responsibility. It is estimated that only 22,000  Emiratis are working in the private sector, despite recent figures indicating that the sector itself provides for more than 4 million jobs. The private sector is a key component of the UAE's economy, and certainly we need the support of a UAE national workforce to contribute to a vibrant economy.</p><h4>What role will the Federal Government play in the UAE's plans to become a hub for global Islamic finance? And how important is Islamic financial services to the economy?</h4><p>Islamic finance has become an important component of the global economy, and the UAE government has been supportive of initiatives to tap the massive opportunities available in the industry, currently valued at more than $1.6 trillion globally.  The UAE is already one of the biggest markets in the region for Islamic banking, and we expect Dubai's ambitious plans to help further improve this vital segment's contribution to the economy. The Islamic banking sector has a bright future in the UAE as it has been playing a major role in financing infrastructure projects, residential properties, and corporate expansion.</p><h4>Abu Dhabi and its fellow Emirates are beginning to implement similar destination services, such as finance and media free zones. How is the Federal Government ensuring that the seven Emirates are complementing each other, rather than competing?</h4><p>The various initiatives of each Emirate are aimed at supporting the overall growth of the UAE economy. We need not look at such initiatives being confined to the competitive level. The UAE government would encourage initiatives such as these to serve complementary purposes by focusing on different parts of respective industries, building up on areas of strength to support the overarching economic framework.</p><h4>How has recent instability impacted the economic relationship between the UAE and other MENA states?</h4><p>While the UAE is concerned about the political instability in the region, the situation has not come in the way of our efforts to build key economic relationships. As a vibrant regional economy, the UAE has maintained good economic relations with most MENA states and is engaged in an integrated action plan to boost economic ties with a number of partners.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Abu Dhabi is quickly becoming one of the world's top business destinations. What are the factors that lend credibility to Abu Dhabi as an international business hub?<br></h4><p>Abu Dhabi is in the process of transforming itself through an ambitious economic vision that aims to achieve sustainable growth through economic diversification away from a heavy reliance on the oil sector. On the other hand, thanks to its position as a major oil producer, Abu Dhabi possesses the necessary financial resources that are needed to help in achieving its goal of building a vibrant and expanding non-oil sector. The healthy and competitive business environment in Abu Dhabi has encouraged domestic and foreign investment. The Emirate is considered an attractive market for international business due to its strong economy and encouraging investment laws. The investment climate in Abu Dhabi is becoming more conducive for local and foreign investors to set up businesses and to enter into joint ventures, as the Emirate has made significant headway in the past five years in developing the role of the private sector. Given Abu Dhabi's environment and the continuous efforts to develop viable and sustainable non-oil sectors, opportunities for investors exist almost everywhere, with the clean energy and tourism sectors occupying a prominent destination for investment. When it comes to attracting business, favorable tax laws are among Abu Dhabi's key competitive advantages. The UAE government levies no corporate or income tax and, at 1.7% of GDP, tax payment rates are among the lowest in the world. For many foreign investors, low taxation policies are a major incentive in deciding where to establish a business, and the government of Abu Dhabi is committed to maintaining a low taxation regime and retaining its competitive edge. Power and water utilities have grown to serve an expanding residential and commercial market. Modern transport and communications links have facilitated trade and business with regional and global partners. The Municipality of Abu Dhabi is currently engaged in executing infrastructure projects worth AED19 billion, or $5.2 billion, and has spent more than AED20 billion on major road works and bridges over the past three years.</p><h4>What role can public-private partnership (PPPs) play in the development of Abu Dhabi's economy?</h4><p>Abu Dhabi, with its significant infrastructure development, is an environment that is well suited to the PPP model. Partnerships have ranged from arms-length outsourcing to stronger cooperation between parties. The Abu Dhabi government is using the PPP structures in the infrastructure, power, water, health, and education sectors including the development of the Industrial City of Abu Dhabi (ICAD) Special Economic Zone. In the health sector, Abu Dhabi has outsourced the management of six of its 12 hospitals to private sector operators. As part of its strategic initiative to improve education at Abu Dhabi government schools, the Abu Dhabi Education Council (ADEC) has engaged with the private sector since 2006. It is certain that the PPP model is gaining ground in the economic development of Abu Dhabi and has started to cover wider business activities.</p><h4>In which non-oil sectors are you seeing increased activity?</h4><p>The announcement from the Abu Dhabi government in April 2013 on the creation of the Abu Dhabi Global Market—a new financial free zone located on Al Maryah Island—is a major step toward transforming the Emirate into a global and regional financial center. The clean energy sector also has huge potential for growth as Abu Dhabi is seeking to become an international center in the field of renewable energy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What factors lend credibility to Abu Dhabi as an international business hub and destination?<br></h4><p>Abu Dhabi has moved up 134 places in the ICCA ranking in 2013 compared to 2012, placing it among the top 100 busiest global meeting destinations for the first time. That in itself is testament to the potential Abu Dhabi has to offer. We are one of only two cities in the Arabian Gulf to have made it that far. Between us and the Abu Dhabi Tourism and Cultural Authority (TCA), we project annual growth of 7% in tourism revenues to $5.1 billion by 2020. This is also an indication of the potential that Abu Dhabi has to offer in terms of business tourism. For example, between 2011 and 2013, the Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre (ADNEC) grew it exhibitions business significantly, from eight to 22 exhibitions per year. In 2012, we hosted 360 events compared to 223 previously. Also in that year, the ophthalmology conference provided further evidence of Abu Dhabi's status as a destination for business tourism. Around 12,000 practitioners hosted their annual conference here, making it the biggest ever held in the Emirate, and marking further great success. We have splendid infrastructure facilities, and pride ourselves on being the best venue in the region in terms of growth potential. All of these factors position Abu Dhabi as a solid destination for business tourism.</p><h4>How important is ADNEC in building the profile of the exhibition center?</h4><p>We host a number of major events in Abu Dhabi. Among them are IDEX and ADIPEC. There are two ways to look at these. One is to consider the ability of Abu Dhabi to host, attract, nurture, and grow such events. If you take the example of IDEX or ADIPEC, these are homegrown events. We now look at those events as the two flagship events of the city that occupy the entire venue. Herein lies the vision that Abu Dhabi has in growing, nurturing, and providing the environment and support that such events require. Many other events, with the support of both ADNEC and Abu Dhabi, can also blossom. We have observed many events developing within a short period of time that come to rival the scale of their major predecessors. Relatively speaking, such events have been staged in Abu Dhabi for five or six years. Both Abu Dhabi and ADNEC are highly supportive of them, and appreciate the value participating businesses bring to the Emirate. Our work now is to provide the best environment for such events. Importantly, we see many new organizers launching shows in Abu Dhabi for the first time. Moreover, in 2013 Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition and Conference (ADIPEC) is set to be annualized for the first time, which will contribute notably to the economy, and there are many factors at play here. We set out by solely hosting IDEX, but today host a number of different shows and organizers.</p><h4>Where does ADNEC fit into Vision 2030?</h4><p>Do we position ourselves on the economic or tourism front? My answer is both. We are contributing to the Abu Dhabi Vision 2030 as a vehicle and driver of economic growth. Business tourism is a key, and we are working hand-in-hand with TCA to develop and support this sector. Moreover, ADNEC is contributing in different ways to employment creation in Abu Dhabi. We perceive nationalization as a key strategic factor for the city. We not only recruit talent, but also nurture it, providing experience and training development programs through our own exhibitions in London. We are creating an environment in which the talents of UAE nationals can be developed. We are also contributing to the initiatives and efforts of Abu Dhabi in terms of renewable energy, having reduced our waste footprint by 15% in 2012. Our efforts are wholly in line with the government's Vision 2030, and are complementary to it.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Where the Action Is]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[where-the-action-is]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Where do the strengths of the Al Gharbia region lie?<br></h4><p>Al Gharbia is also known as the Western Region of the Abu Dhabi Emirate and accounts for 60% of the landmass, but only 12% of the population. Despite the low population, it generates 45% of GDP. The region is, therefore, very important socially, economically, and strategically, and the government is paying special attention to it, having created the Western Region Development Council (WRDC). Everyone is working toward the overall development of the Abu Dhabi Emirate, but the government clearly wants to fast-track Al Gharbia. We report to the government, and act as a development agency for the region to deliver the region's vision and advice on implementing plans for all sectors, all the way from ideas, research, feasibility, to project management and private investments. Therefore, we believe that the region should be the energy base of the UAE. We have the ideas, but we are not an authority per se. Whatever we do toward realizing the vision, such as the planning, implementation, and project management, should ultimately be sold to the people. For that, we need government approval and private sector financing.</p><h4>What determines these priorities, and how does the community benefit?</h4><p>Abu Dhabi has oil and gas, 90% of which is in Al Gharbia. We have the largest gas plant in the world and the biggest oil refinery. We can, therefore, create more supporting industries for those mega investments. The next important sector is petrochemicals. As a growing local and global market, the investment climate is favorable for this sector. However, in Al Gharbia, there is also a local community with limited opportunities. When they see a refinery being built next to a town, people begin to wonder what is in it for them. We have to make sure, therefore, that the communities similarly benefit. This can be done through creating job opportunities for both women and men in addition to providing more scholarships for students and attractive incentives for local entrepreneurs. This results in a multi-faceted positive impact on the economic and social wellbeing of our people.</p><h4>What tourism-related activities are you promoting?</h4><p>Sir Bani Yas is the center of Al Gharbia's tourism market. The government has invested heavily in developing its infrastructure. Liwa is another major destination for tourism. Over 2013, we worked to create new facilities and islands, and we want to introduce a plan for light, small-, and medium-sized projects. At the moment, we are planning a tourism camp and have already received the requisite approvals. Development should begin soon, and is exclusively spearheaded by the private sector. It is called the Liwa Knowledge and Experience Center. Naturally, we also boast larger scale facilities, such as five-star hotels, and we plan to build a number of business hotels in the townships.</p><h4>There are a number of wider UAE projects at various phases of development around Al Gharbia, such as the new Etihad Rail link. How will this affect the region?</h4><p>Al Gharbia is the gateway to the UAE, and we expect many visitors; however, we will continue to promote its industrial activities. Phases I and II of Etihad Rail are in Al Gharbia. Yet this is not merely connecting people, but also projects, and will promote light industrial activities. Once the project is complete, it will connect Abu Dhabi and the entire UAE to the outer world.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does Invest AD have to offer international investors?</h4><p>Invest AD's mission is to provide global investors with attractive investment opportunities in the Middle East and Africa regions where we have operated successfully for over three decades. We offer equity funds and discretionary accounts with a proven track record of outperformance in recent years, and have also forged strategic, global relationships with partners in Western Europe, Russia, and East Asia. The attraction is high-quality access to some of the world's fastest growing economies, through a partner with wide and long-standing networks across the region. I believe that we are genuinely playing a part, however modest today, in the formation of new patterns of capital flow that will shape and rebalance the global economy over the coming years.</p><h4>Why does Invest AD have such a specific focus?</h4><p>This is because of its increased international profile, especially over the past decade, where Abu Dhabi has emerged as a key gateway to the Middle East and Africa regions. Intra-regional trade and investment have been growing steadily, and I can see from the official delegations that visit Abu Dhabi and the global reach of the Emirate's institutions, that international linkages are only going to grow further. Invest AD has a specific role to play in supporting global partners who also see the high potential of the region. A couple of years ago, we commissioned the Economist Intelligence Unit to survey the world's major institutional investors on their attitudes to investing in Africa, and the message was clear; almost all intended to significantly increase allocations to the continent over the subsequent five years. The main motivation for interest was the region's rising middle class and personal income; quite a shift for a continent that had previously attracted interest merely as a source of commodities.</p><h4>What are your connections in South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, and China, and how do you engage with those parts of the world?</h4><p>We have been developing relationships with institutions in East Asia for a number of years. I believe it is a natural development for investment flows between the regions to rise significantly now, given that trade has already flourished. Currently, we manage private institutional money from Japan and also have partners in China. We also have a strategic agreement with the Korea Development Bank.</p><div class="quote">“  We have plans to establish a presence in Morocco and are among the very few entities to have received a license from the Casablanca Finance City. "</div><h4>What challenges do Invest AD's Africa-related plans face in terms of geography, language, and time zone, and how are you working to overcome them?</h4><p>We have plans to establish a presence in Morocco and are among the very few entities to have received a license from the Casablanca Finance City. This is a particularly interesting proposition as, in investment terms, much of the greater Northwest Africa region is uncharted territory and, by providing a gateway, Casablanca Finance City can help investors to participate in Africa's exciting transformation. It also seeks to establish itself as the window to investment opportunities in West Africa as a financial hub. The region is home to 520 million people, and its economy is developing rapidly thanks to intra-regional investment and trade flows, as well as through greater integration into the global economy.</p><h4>What is your policy toward developing human capital at Invest AD?</h4><p>When considering the factors involved in production, the human factor emerges as the most important. Your legacy is measured by what you have done to advance your people. In the UAE, we are blessed with leadership that has made its citizens the top priority. At Invest AD, we are committed to training our employees, but even more importantly, to making sure that they benefit from our everyday operational exposure to international finance. All new hires at Invest AD receive a thorough induction to its business areas, receiving training in technical skills, business skills, and management to encourage fast progress. Development and potential are regularly monitored so as to identify high-performing individuals who are likely to succeed in senior management roles. We also encourage our employees to interact with the community. We are proud supporters of autistic students at the Abu Dhabi Autism Center, and extend our means to facilitate their inclusion in society to be able to contribute to Abu Dhabi's economy and society.</p><h4>Is this shifting global economic paradigm affecting the operations of Invest AD?</h4><p>The global economy is undergoing a large-scale process of rebalancing, and the implications and impact are obviously going to be felt over many years. Everywhere you look, the world is being redefined. For example, India plans to send a spacecraft to Mars, and is truly competing with the US, Europe, and Russia in the space industry, which could have a knock-on effect on innovation in many fields. Meanwhile, China has not only become the manufacturing base of the world, but is also moving swiftly up the value chain. Here in the UAE, the key objective is to diversify our economy and build a knowledge base. In Africa, we see countries jumping several stages of development in small, but significant ways. For example, in Kenya, people who only a couple of years ago had no access to formal banking, are now receiving salaries and storing money deposits on their mobile phone accounts. Our job is to try to understand the changes and to position our offering through our different funds to clients accordingly. That is why, at Invest AD, we pursue on-the-ground research when exploring investment opportunities. Our portfolio managers are always on the go, especially in Africa, and place strong emphasis on direct contact with the senior management of companies, and policy makers.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What advantages does the UAE offer Italian investors, and what other sectors are appealing for Italian companies?<br></h4><p>Italy has a growing community of entrepreneurs in the UAE, and it also has the opportunity to strengthen its ties with the country, and this will materialize in economic deals with their economic partners in the Emirates. I was very happy to hear the declaration about Alitalia and Etihad's potential partnership, and this was one of the main subjects of discussion during the latest meetings in the UAE. The conclusion was positive, and we will do our part in the best way possible. In Italy, all concerned parties will contribute to work toward a positive outcome for this agreement. I think it is important that every single concerned party takes their place. What we have done during our visit is very positive for both Italy and the UAE. Italy is now a country that must attract new investors. We hope that we can get the attention of our Emirati counter parties.</p><h4>What will be the focus of bilateral relations in 2014 and over the medium term?</h4><p>I can say that, as far as I am concerned, this visit set the basis for this strategic partnership for the years to come. I very proudly explained to my Emirati counterparts that Italy has come out of the financial crisis by its own capability, without asking for funds or any bail out from the EU. When we are in trouble, we emerge from troubled waters under our own strength and capabilities. We will continue our strategic partnership. We found in Dubai and Abu Dhabi a great interest in Italy, and the negotiations regarding Alitalia is also proof of this. We have set a strategic course with a perspective that is not just based on sporadic meetings or agreements, but today we can say that we have created strategic cooperation between the UAE and Italy. There is wide, strategic cooperation between both countries.</p><h4>How will the experience of the Milan Expo 2015 serve to help the UAE, and Dubai in particular, assist in the staging of Expo 2020?</h4><p>The World Expo is one our main links. There will be one held in Milan in 2015, while Dubai's will be held in 2020. We have always supported Dubai's nomination for the Expo. We will help to create a firmer level of investment with the Expo. It is a fundamental element for us. Of course, this visit to the UAE is aimed at strengthening the cooperation between both countries at a strategic level. The World Expo will lead to further cooperation between our two countries. We are able today to help the UAE and the Dubai Expo team avoid many mistakes. We worked very hard in the early years, and we want the UAE to avoid some of the mistakes we experienced when preparing Milan Expo 2015. We had a session on the post-Expo plans, and we were very impressed to see that the Dubai team was already considering plans for the post-Expo scenario.</p><h4>What is your economic outlook for the UAE, and how do you envision future relations between Italy and the UAE?</h4><p>Our visit was a great success. The agreements we signed during our visit to the UAE were very important. Expo is a great opportunity for both countries to meet and share experiences. It is a long journey. As far as I am concerned, I found a great reception from the people, and my story about Italy wanting to open up to new investors and that Italy wants to attract investment from abroad was well received. There is already a process of privatization underway in Italy, so it is an ideal opportunity for investors to get involved. I have introduced the sovereign funds of Abu Dhabi and Dubai to Italy's privatization plans. The reaction I gathered directly will bring very positive returns in terms of investment for Italy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased that my government has decided to provide the region with financial assistance amounting to $2.2 billion, aimed at helping to build lasting peace and stability in the region. It is in other words, substantiating our cooperation.<br></p><p>Now is the time for us to pool our wisdom, and aim higher and further. I am glad that my country, Japan, is part of an integral part of your dream.</p><p>For Japan and the Middle East to aim higher we have created a pilot project. Called the Corridor for Peace and Prosperity, it is a project that involves Israel, Jordan and Palestine. One single absentee among the three could ruin the entire project, as it really takes the trio to participate.</p><div class="quote">“I want to increase our exchanges at the people-to-people and academic levels with the countries of the Middle East such as Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Turkey. "</div><p>The project is designed to transform an area of Jordan Valley into productive, fertile land and give the young people in the West Bank a promising opportunity to experience the fruits of their diligent labour. I look forward to welcoming fast-growing companies in the Middle East in joining the Corridor project to improve the healthy relationships that we share in this region.</p><p>I want to increase our exchanges at the people-to-people and academic levels with the countries of the Middle East such as Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Turkey.</p><p>I am of the view that most government officials in Japan are unselfish, upright individuals who work hard at their jobs. Some countries in the Middle East have voiced interest in sending their public officials to Japan to learn more about the qualities of public service in Japan.</p><p>I know that people in the Middle East, regardless of their nationality or the political system they live under, all desire that their society be bribery-free and orderly. If Japan can be in a position to be of any assistance in that area, nothing else would make us more proud as Japanese.</p><p>Over the next five years, my government will invite business trainees from the Middle East and send Japanese instructors in return to the region. The two-way exchanges should amount to 20,000 people.</p><p>We also plan to increase the number of Middle Eastern students studying in Japan. Over the past seven years, the number from Saudi Arabia has expanded from 30 to 500. From the UAE around 60 students are currently in Japan, but that total, too, should be increased to 500. The number of female students among them, I am sure, will soar to something like several dozen.</p><p>Specifically, in Abu Dhabi, we are participating actively with the government to improve the bilateral relationship that we share. Responding to strong requests from the local community, we have decided to open our Japanese school for local children to be enrolled. Those young children, who are our future leaders, will be studying side-by-side. They will be laughing and smiling, engaged in joyful extra-curricular activities, like the sports and arts festivals that Japanese schools are renowned for. That, I believe, is the vision of our common future.</p><p>I promise that the government of Japan will work harder to enrich our mutual understandings between Japan and the Middle East, in this specific case with Abu Dhabi. I promise that my government will further enhance dialogue among the Japanese and Middle Eastern intellectual leaders, who will seek even better and deeper ways for us to do more together.</p><p>I started my address today with the subject of two “leaps." One leap involves a transformation from our resource-centric relationship to the one marked by full-scale economic ties and a quest for coexistence and co-prosperity. The second leap comprises an evolution from purely economic ties to a relationship marked by cooperation in the quest for regional peace, stability, and growth.</p><p>This process will give rise to a relationship of multifaceted synergy. In other words, ties traditionally defined by energy will be supplanted by ties of fully fledged synergy.</p><p>That development in turn will foster an even stronger relationship of collaboration, coexistence, and co-prosperity between Japan and the countries of the Middle East. To assist the region in building a foundation for hope and powerful economic growth in the years ahead, Japan will pour its resources into a quest for collaboration, coexistence and co-prosperity with the region.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What specific areas have you identified for collaboration between Abu Dhabi and Singapore?<br></h4><p>Abu Dhabi is guided by the Vision 2030 and so we know that it has a strong desire to diversify away from oil and gas and develop a varied economic matrix with services and manufacturing accounting for 60% of GDP. Today, the figure is at 44%, and I must comment on its efforts. For example, in aerospace, Abu Dhabi boasts a repair and overhaul center, and is now setting up its own manufacturing center to produce composite components and parts for Boeing and Airbus. It has established Etihad Airlines and aspires to create an aviation hub, perhaps smaller than that of Dubai. It is also entering the semiconductors segment. Abu Dhabi and Singapore are now creating a joint laboratory to conduct semiconductor research, and both have pledged a total of $21 million over three years to the venture, which is to focus on collaborative research projects in micro-electro-mechanical systems (mems), a type of semiconductor chip intended for next-generation products. It is also venturing into semi-conductors, buying into our global foundry, the $3 billion investment of which is by far Abu Dhabi's largest into Singapore. Of course, Emiratis are very curious about how we developed our industrial segments and airport, and so at one time our airport group was providing advisory services to the authorities there on the Etihad deal at Abu Dhabi Airport. In infrastructure, manufacturing, and services Emiratis are keen to establish means of working with us. In banking, First Gulf Bank and Emirate NBD are present here, and in terms of banking, we are an Asian financial center. A glance at our geography reveals that we are a seven hour flight away, and we serve two distinctive regions, as a result of which we are both highly competitive and complementary.</p><h4>What are the opportunities for Singapore businesses and investment in Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>Over the past few years, we have seen many Singaporean master planning agencies and conceptual design companies go to Abu Dhabi to help plan zones and industrial districts. We are well known for urban and city planning; being a small city-state, we've learned from experience that a good blue print allows for sustainable development for decades to come, but that if you lack one, you very soon run into bottlenecks. On the master-planning front, we have many companies providing services there. This also includes areas such as water treatment and waste management, where we have some experience to contribute. Another area is individual building design; for example, we have several companies specialized in building hotels. Similarly, we have architects, and a good example of their success is the Dubai Mall, designed by DP Architects from Singapore. We even have companies in the retail sector. Charles and Keith, for example, is a Singaporean company. It really depends on what Abu Dhabi has to offer, and how open it is in terms of business opportunities.</p><h4>What were some of the milestones of the 2013 forum?</h4><p>We have had seven years of meetings thus far, and many success stories have emerged. One of the most productive components of the forum involves individual work groups. For example, the 2013 forum staged a work group on semiconductors, with others on water management, oil and gas, transport and logistics, and urban planning. The whole idea behind combining semiconductors and water management was to seek ways to work together; perhaps Abu Dhabi could borrow some of the experiences we have implemented in Abu Dhabi, or else co-develop some of the technology for export. Ultimately, I think what we have successfully forged with Abu Dhabi is a high level of understanding and trust, and indeed, we are now talking about third-country investments together. For example, much time has recently been devoted to investment opportunities in Southeast Asia, as we are among the top three investors in many countries, such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and Vietnam. In China, we rank among the top five. As a result, our friends from Abu Dhabi agree that we know this region well, and that they want to partner our companies to explore some of these opportunities.</p><div class="quote">“ We share a strong desire to improve the lives of our people, and to create a better, fairer, and more inclusive society."</div>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you talk about your vision for developing business ties with the UAE?<br></h4><p>Our vision of ties between Australia and the UAE is clear and positive, because there is already a multi-faceted relationship that seems to be growing rapidly. The base is already robust as the UAE is our largest trading partner in the Middle East. The UAE is very familiar to many Australians, and there are over 350 Australian firms operating there. And the UAE's presence in Australia is also increasing. The UAE is a major infrastructure investor in Australia, and there are two important partnerships: the Emirates-Qantas partnership and the Etihad-Virgin partnership, which both link to Abu Dhabi. These partnerships are increasing person-to-person contact, which is very important for furthering economic relationships and developing some depth and sustainability. Education is a prime example of an area where we are moving beyond simply seeing students arrive in Australia to study. For example, the Abu Dhabi Vocational Education and Training Institute are developing a new framework of qualifications for vocational training using Australian standards. This is an area where real depth and substance is being added to the relationship. We are very positive about it, and view it as one of the areas where Australia needs to be devoting its efforts. We are planning to hold a major program that will bring together businesspeople and others in April 2014 in both Dubai and Abu Dhabi around the theme of Australia Unlimited, which will give us an opportunity to talk about trade, investment, cultural ties, and the opportunities that lie therein.</p><h4>What are Australia's competitive advantages as an investment destination for UAE investors?</h4><p>The most important consideration is that we are a low risk proposition and provide stable returns. We are in a competitive world for investment dollars; yet we remain a substantial market. We are the fourth largest market in the Asia-Pacific region, and have experienced 22 years of economic growth. Australia has an innovative economy, a skilled workforce, a strategic location in the Asia-Pacific region, and a stable and transparent business environment. Yet while all of these are important parts of the mix, the key factor is a stable environment of low risk and solid returns. We have already seen this investment happen, with major commitments in tourism, infrastructure, and in the New South Wales ports, which are highly significant. We are keen to ensure our competitiveness. The government is placing much emphasis on attracting investment and lowering costs in Australia. We want to make sure everyone understands that we are open for business and that we want to do our utmost to encourage investment from all our partners. It has put into play a very strong portfolio of major infrastructure projects; the government itself is investing and looking for others to do so. I foresee considerable potential here. We know that we have to work out how to be competitive and how to attract investment, but the key message is that the UAE is a very important source of wealth, and we hope we are providing the right environment to attract that to Australia.</p><h4>What are the factors that have encouraged so many Australians to do business in the UAE?</h4><p>There are 350 Australian companies in the UAE and more than 16,000 residents. This is because the UAE is very welcoming, and that Australians feel very comfortable living and working in the country. The openness of the UAE to the skills and expertise that others can bring is an important part of that, as are the connections that the various airlines provide. The way in which some of the business networks are working, such as the Australian Business Council in Dubai and the Business Group in Abu Dhabi, contribute to it. Therefore, as a result of that, many Australians in areas including construction, financial services, banking, agriculture, and health are finding something to contribute in Abu Dhabi.</p><div class="quote">"The UAE is very familiar to many Australians, and there are over 350 Australian firms operating there."</div>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-balance-to-maintain]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the Department of Finance's (DoF's) key contributions toward achieving the Vision 2030 goals?<br></h4><p>The DoF is supporting the Abu Dhabi Economic Vision 2030 via a number of strategic plans to implement an effective financial management framework and a sound fiscal policy across the Emirate. This will assist the government in strategically allocating its resources and efficiently delivering its services to the public. We introduced a financial policy practice, which provides advice on fiscal policies to the government and works to establish a unified treasury system to improve Abu Dhabi's management of financial resources and meet international best practices. State-of-the-art information technologies are being adopted to improve the government's management of its financial and analytical systems.</p><h4>Can you explain the ethos behind DoF's Five-Year Strategic Plan?</h4><p>The strategic vision of the government of Abu Dhabi is focused on creating an attractive, secure investment climate in order to sustainably develop a strong and competitive global economy. The Emirate is committed to providing a clear vision for all government sectors to define priorities, objectives, initiatives, work methodologies, performance measures, and development tools within the public policy agenda for the management of the public sector in Abu Dhabi. As such, the DoF is working to strengthen its leading role in the government's work system and to maintain Abu Dhabi's financial and economic stability. The Department is also working to achieve its vision of providing prosperity and security for Abu Dhabi residents through an advanced financial framework and prudent fiscal policy. In regard to the implementation of the DoF's strategic plan the Department has developed its tasks to better serve the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, for both citizens and entities. It operates within a holistic and integrated framework for effective financial management in accordance with the government's vision, providing adequate funding for government initiatives including those held in partnership with private sectors, promoting the strategic use of financial resources through good performance management and monitoring, and by applying global best practices in various areas of its work.</p><h4>How is the DoF committed to training its staff, and what development opportunities are on offer to department employees?</h4><p>The DoF is working to build its human capabilities, and enhancing their knowledge and skills. Additionally, it has been tasked with building finance capabilities across the Abu Dhabi's various government departments. As such, the Department, in collaboration with the Centre of Excellence in the General Secretariat of the Executive Council, devised an integrated plan to establish the DoF's role in the training of finance staff and the development of new programs. In total, 10 financial training programs have now been established for staff working for the government of Abu Dhabi and the Department is working with universities to provide courses to employees, allowing them to enhance their work related-skills and knowledge. In addition, the DoF has also devised a plan entitled “Developmental Path," which enables finance employees to receive professional certificates in the field of finance and accounting such as CPA, CMA, CFA, and CIA qualifications. In addition, the DoF has created a professional framework to motivate employees to engage in these programs and gain professional certifications. The DoF has also carried out a number of specialized workshops covering the government's financial system, for executives and financial staff across various government departments. Most recently, heads of department and general managers from the Executive Council participated in a workshop entitled Government Financial System Framework in Abu Dhabi.</p><div class="quote">“  A unified treasury account system will enable the DoF to achieve the targets set by the Executive Council. "</div><h4>What sort of fiscal policy are you developing for Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>Fiscal policy focuses on total government revenues and spending, as well as its overall impact on the economy. The main focus in Abu Dhabi is on the spending perspective, since most of the revenue comes from oil. When spending grows too slowly, or falls, it can lead to periods of very slow economic growth, or even a recession, whereas if spending grows too rapidly, it can lead to rapid growth and possibly fuel high inflation rates. Thus, a major consideration of fiscal policy is to control spending to maintain steady growth. The other consideration is to not consistently, over a long period of time, overspend your revenues. We have recently witnessed the negative effects that countries can end up experiencing as a result of this. For instance, Abu Dhabi receives a fair amount of revenue from oil. Yet it is not endless, which means that prudent fiscal policy must take this issue into account. The DoF has recently set up a new fiscal policy directorate, which has been developing detailed fiscal plans based on macroeconomic forecasts, called Medium-Term Fiscal Frameworks, for several years now.</p><h4>What are the DoF's achievements in regard to the implementation of its performance budgeting system?</h4><p>The performance budgeting system is a major project for the department, which we've been working on since last year. The system, which is being designed to meet international best practices, will enable the government of Abu Dhabi to link the budget with the Emirate's performance and ensure the efficient management of resources. The Department began using the trial version of the system from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014, before fully implementing it across all government bodies in Abu Dhabi. For performance-based budgeting to work, a reconsideration of spending priorities and program performance need to be formally integrated into the budget process, while the next step is to connect the strategic plans of each government agency with operational plans, in order to evaluate the annual expenditure of all government bodies and keep spending in check. The ADERP system, which the DoF has already implemented across 26 government entities and plans to introduce to all government bodies by the end of 2015, will help the Department to achieve this. Through the ADERP system, the DoF will establish a unified methodology in the management of financial resources, government accounts, and budget preparation, in addition to the development and application of a uniform procurement system to raise the efficiency of financial data management and reporting. Existing cooperation between the Department and various government entities is vital to the successful implementation and preparation of the budget and financial reports.</p><h4>How is the DoF progressing in its efforts to continue developing Abu Dhabi's economy?</h4><p>The DoF's operations are centered on managing and budgeting Abu Dhabi's finances in the best way possible, in addition to implementing sound financial policies to support the Emirate in achieving its goals and in maintaining a sustainable economic environment. The Department's role ranges from providing the financial framework, to managing budgets and offering strategic counsel. The DoF's activities allow the Emirate to efficiently fund projects in infrastructure, health, education and other sectors. The Department also supports Abu Dhabi's efforts to attract both local and foreign investors. The DoF also recently announced the introduction of a new Public Debt Policy, established under the directives of the Executive Council of Abu Dhabi, which the Department feels will prove critical in terms of the ongoing development of Abu Dhabi's economy. The new Public Debt Policy has been designed to control all borrowing by the government and by companies fully owned, or more than 50% government owned, to deliver maximum transparency and efficiency, at minimum risk.</p><h4>What are the DoF's motives behind the application of a unified treasury account system?</h4><p>A unified treasury account system will enable the DoF to achieve the targets set by the Executive Council in terms of decentralization and the facilitation of payment procedures in order to be more efficient. The treasury account system, which will be governed by ADERP, also aims to encourage “financial independence" among government departments in order to maintain control over spending and budget policies. This system will allow for a gradual transition towards having decentralized financial management, by applying international best practice in the financial sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

The premise of the new plan is a simple philosophy of being driven by the customer agenda, or what we call “being core to our chosen customers." In that regard, moving away from a scale-to-scale model is important. Part of the problem with banks globally is that they tend to talk of market share in the same way as industrial firms, when really a bank's share of the revenue wallet is more important. In that statement, you are dealing with clear risk and return criteria. Within that context, our customer profiles may vary; in certain businesses this means retail customers, and in others portfolio customers. In the wholesale banking arena the focus leans much more toward certain industry segments, and subsequently specific customers. Our customer-oriented strategy has three major tenets. The first is to lift NBAD from the number five position in the UAE in commercial and retail banking to number one. In wholesale banking, sometimes called corporate banking—even though the two are different—we are reasonably strong. And in terms of local banks, we are the number one player. And yet, in the retail and commercial bracket, we are massively underweight. Being number five, in my view, is not acceptable if NBAD is to be a strong force in the domestic market.</p><h4>How will NBAD expand abroad?</h4><p>We are looking to build five franchises, in addition to our UAE Gulf franchise, in five countries. Yet, this will take place a little further down the line; we need to get rings one and two in place first. We will look at destination markets of high growth and some volatility, which allows us to capitalize on our rating, high urbanization rate, aggressive GDP per capita, and urban growth. We want to create a business model that acknowledges that we are not going to be the number one bank in any of these countries, as that status is the preserve of a local bank, but one nonetheless that allows us to deploy significant offerings across our retail, commercial, and wholesale banking businesses around specific cities and specific targeted groups. For us, the affluent are important. We don't need 5,000 branches in these destinations to be effective and generate money. We are looking to target specific countries. It could be Egypt, Malaysia, or elsewhere. We are really only starting to formulate these five countries now. Nigeria is also a very attractive market, for example. The mistake that people make is to think that global banking works; it doesn't—not in terms of returns. It is becoming increasingly difficult, too, because of regulatory changes. We therefore have to strategically allocate our resources.</p><h4>Why should UAE depositors contemplate moving to NBAD?</h4><p>One of our value propositions, and I think this has been proven in times of crisis, is a solid rating and safety value. We are now one of the world's 50 safest banks, and the safest bank in the emerging markets. This is clearly something that corporations and individuals want to deal with. We should add to that our customer proposition in terms of improved service and dedication to a relationship, rather than a product push approach, which is something I emphasize considerably. Customers since 2008 are looking for safety and quality service. We have a lot to do, but I think we are well on the way in terms of relationships. There are few banks that take this, rather than the product approach, and all of them besides us, have major operations in Asia, or are actually from the continent. This insight and knowledge of the customer is something we have to maximize.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What strategy is the Securities &amp; Commodities Authority (SCA) employing to attract foreign investors to the exchanges?<br></h4><p>Cross-border investment into the UAE stock exchanges is based on trusting that they are properly regulated and protected from market abuse, as well as on the free flow of capital. Gaining investor confidence takes years, especially when a significant amount of money is in the balance, and is a prerequisite, preceding the expectation of reaping profits. While stock market performances are left to investor expectations of listed companies' profitability, the SCA has been working to provide a level playing field in line with international best practices. In this sense, the SCA has been active in reviewing several elements that can enhance market functioning: DvP settlement has been introduced for improved safety of execution, XBRL was introduced to enhance the transparency of disclosure, a new funds regime was introduced to enhance and encourage investment recipients that would lead to improved institutional investment presence in the Emirati capital markets, along with the market maker, short selling, securities lending, and borrowing regulations to improve market depth. All these new regulations constitute a regulatory framework that is welcoming of foreign investors, who mainly look for opportunities in local capital markets, considering too, the safety of their investments under the protection of a full regulatory framework. The successful passage and implementation of these regulations, coupled with the relentless efforts of the ESCA and its strategic partners, have led to the recent upgrade to “Emerging Market" status by the MSCI index, which will also lead to a greater attraction of foreign investors to the local exchanges.</p><h4>How is the SCA currently working to boost the local securities markets?</h4><p>The SCA has diligently overseen the UAE capital markets by employing best international practices. One of the key methods of boosting the local securities markets has been SCA's adherence to global best practices in order to protect investors and improve the efficiency of the UAE's capital markets through the development of the necessary supervisory regulations. Secondly, the SCA's close relations with the industry, investors, and stakeholders has allowed for the quick identification, resolution, and issuance of regulatory requirements. As a regulator, the SCA has approved and guided 133 entities and companies to list on both the Dubai Financial Market (DFM) and Abu Dhabi Stock Market (ADX), as well as supervising and overseeing a substantial rise and subsequent consolidation of a significant number of brokerage houses. Other key milestones include the SCA's contribution to the improvement of the educational awareness of both institutional and retail investors, including on-going training workshops regularly conducted by the SCA discussing the implementation of the SCA codes and laws with market participants.</p><h4>How does the SCA regulate Islamic bonds, and what steps are being taken to safeguard against a quick sell off?</h4><p>SCA regulations cover the listing of Islamic bonds and sukuks, and require that all issuances of such bonds through public subscription first be authorized by the SCA, and that such securities are approved by an SCA-regulated sharia committee. They are required to comply with the requirements of the central bank before being listed on any licensed stock exchange. The SCA is currently working on expanding and developing these regulations to cover all stages from issuance through to listing, trading, clearing, and settlement. This will ensure supporting an efficient trading infrastructure, which is key to the development of both the primary and secondary markets for sukuks in the UAE. The SCA is committed to providing a regulatory environment supportive of and conducive to innovation and growth of the Islamic capital markets in the UAE, while ensuring that the interests of both issuers and investors are protected.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess Franco-Emirati trade relations?<br></h4><p>The UAE and France have strong and confident historical ties. Since the establishment of the Federation, leaders on both sides have cultivated an exceptional relationship that has strengthened trust and complicity, which benefits our trade and economic relationship. The UAE has become in recent years a strategic economic partner of France in the Middle East. Absorbing ‚¬3.53 billion of our exports, the UAE is our primary commercial market in the Gulf. Our bilateral trade generated a positive balance of ‚¬2.37 billion in 2012, the fourth largest global surplus for our country. Our exports are based on four sectors: food processing, aerospace, electrical and mechanical equipment, and consumer goods, including luxury goods. Our imports are mainly comprised of petroleum products (about 80%). Major French groups have long been established in the UAE and cover a wide variety of sectors, including oil, aviation, banking and insurance, retail, hospitality, and transport. In addition to this, several major projects have been carried out by French companies. Our dynamic bilateral trade relationship is reflected in growing interest from our businesses in the UAE. Today, we count 600 French companies in the country, and their numbers increase steadily by 10% annually. This is a sign of the UAE's dynamic economy. It also shows the performance of our companies, large and small, where their technologies and know-how meet the expectations of a country in search of the most innovative technologies.</p><h4>What priorities do you assign to economic cooperation between France and Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>Regarding our largest commercial market, we hope to maintain the density of our trade by increasing our market share in the country. Due to increasingly fierce foreign competition in the UAE, today more than ever, we must continue to intensify our efforts to strengthen our position in a market that is one of the most dynamic and most creditworthy in the Middle East.  First and foremost, it is important that our champions, including Total, GDF Suez, Technip, Veolia, EADS, Airbus, Alstom, Thales, BNP, Société Générale, and Carrefour, successfully position themselves for major equipment programs launched in the emirate: the development of the oil sector and renewable energy, urban transport metro, tram, and bus projects in Abu Dhabi, and civil aviation, particularly in its industrial components. Secondly, it seems to me essential to reinforce the presence of our SMEs, whose expansion in the UAE remains insufficient. Several sectors are profitable for them; in particular, I think hydrocarbons, urban development, food, health, environment, and biotechnology.</p><p>To this end, I place great emphasis on concerted actions designed to lend more visibility to our know-how. Thus, in the field of urban development we have launched an initiative that unites the French offer as a whole by creating Vivapolis, a real brand that promotes the French sustainable city, which will help our companies to succeed in the international markets in this sector. Vivapolis brings together more than 80 large and small companies that can provide global solutions to meet all the challenges of intensive urban development.</p><div class="quote">“Our bilateral trade generated a balance of ‚¬2.37 billion in 2012.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange (ADX) General Index recently rallied to its highest level in more than three years. What is spurring market confidence amid so much global uncertainty?<br></h4><p>In terms of performance, the ADX was up by almost 18.5% as of April 14, 2013, making it the fifth best performing market globally. In 2012, the index was up by 9%—there is a constant growth pattern here. We have noticed liquidity returning, and the activity picked up after ADX-listed companies reported good financial results in 2012. Based on a report by Al Fajr Securities, the total aggregate profits for local companies are valued at AED41.8 billion, which is up by 25.8% in comparison to 2011. The cash dividends issued in 2013 were valued at AED15 billion, which is 14% up on the previous year. ADX's share of the total cash dividend distributed by companies listed on the UAE stock markets is 64%. What's more, Abu Dhabi's economy is expected to grow further, and the IMF growth prediction is at 3.1%, while that of the Emirate itself is 5.7%.</p><h4>How can the ADX become more reflective of the economy in Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>The economy of Abu Dhabi is expected to have grown by 5.7% in 2013. It is clear that the non-oil sector is playing a bigger role than before, but the key driver is still the petrochemicals sector. However, there are no petrochemical companies listed on the ADX, meaning the main driver of the economy is not present on the exchange yet. There are also many other important sectors that are performing well but are not represented, such as education and healthcare. This means that the performance of the ADX does not reflect the real performance of the economy of Abu Dhabi. In addition, many other large companies operating in Abu Dhabi are not listed on the exchange because they are either private or family-owned companies.</p><h4>What makes listing on the ADX attractive to domestic companies?</h4><p>It is a great advantage to be a part of a strong economy with a clear strategy, as is the case with ADX, and our close affiliation with the government through Vision 2030. Another advantage is being a full member of the World Federation of Exchanges (WFE). Actually, we are the youngest stock market to have received this honor since the inception of the organization. These factors ensure that the prospect of listing on the ADX is an attractive one. We are working very hard to promote Abu Dhabi, its agenda, its companies, and its vision. We encourage companies to channel themselves through this vision—that is to market themselves, be promoted, go abroad, and showcase their products. We believe that the liquidity is there and has always been available. It is simply a matter of time, of building more confidence, and of working harder to attract existing liquidity—especially institutional liquidity. If the companies were to take on such tasks, the result would be a rise in the value of their shares, which, after all, is what companies want.</p><h4>What opportunities are you seeing in the growth of the sukuk market?</h4><p>In 2012, the GCC was particularly active in terms of issuing sukuk bonds, and in a record performance 54% of issued sukuk bonds were from the UAE. Nevertheless, the local market only carries one convertible bond. Alternatively, we perceive big opportunities for the listing of bonds and sukuks on the ADX. The opportunity will not come immediately given that these instruments are continuously traded over the counter (OTC). This is the prospect we are looking at and we are working with the relevant authorities to achieve it. We have already put the legal framework together and developed the internal set up.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the core points of the Second Five-year Economic Plan drawn up by the Abu Dhabi Department of Economic Development (ADDED) for the Emirate of Abu Dhabi (2013-2017)?</h4><p><span></span>The Five-Year Economic Plan 2013-2017 is the second episode in a series of economic plans aimed at achieving the Vision 2030. We are mandated to articulate these comprehensive plans, and these projects are completed by means of a structured collaborative process led by the ADDED and involving all key public and private stakeholders within the different economic sectors in the Emirate. The process has four key elements. The first is related to developing bottom-up analysis to assess the overall economic impact of activity in the sector. The second is focused on key growth sectors identified by the Economic Vision 2030 as strategic drivers for economic growth. Next is the identification of inconsistencies between the five-year plans and the growth paths proposed in the Vision during this timeframe. Finally, the institutionalization of a formal data sharing and economic policy planning process across Abu Dhabi's key sectors is necessary.</p><h4>What areas are prioritized in these plans?</h4><p>The realization of sustainable economic development, especially in the view of the rapid economic and political changes influencing the structure of the global economy, is a major priority. At the same time, we need to ensure balanced economic development across the three regions of Abu Dhabi by reducing development gaps between them. Strengthening and reinforcing the role of the private sector, particularly SMEs, in Abu Dhabi's economy, coupled with the provision of the best facilities and services to attract international capital and expertise, are other key elements. We also need to transform our economic sectors toward knowledge-based and sustainable competitive fields; we must empower the appropriate productive linkage among enablers and target sectors to correctly allocate resources. We are undergoing a new phase of development with the strong commitment of the government.</p><h4>How does the new Abu Dhabi Tasdeer program support export development in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>Since 2009, the Foreign Trade and Export Support division has delivered workshops and seminars to increase the export knowledge of Abu Dhabi companies. We work in four areas: tatweer (capabilities), tawjeeh (intelligence), tarweej (connections), and tas'heel (advocacy). We work with the appropriate entities within the UAE to reduce or eliminate barriers to Abu Dhabi exports. The companies participating include state-owned enterprises, the operating units of large corporates, SMEs, and Khalifa Fund companies. Additionally, there are export development executives (EDEs) and Khalifa Fund advisors enrolled. We are excited about this program and its outcomes. This approach is well received by the participants and may become the model for delivery of future structured Export tatweer programs.</p><div class="quote">“Figures show that bilateral trade between the EU and the UAE increased by 7.4% in 2012 to reach ‚¬45.4 billion. "</div><h4>How do you anticipate the proposed Schengen visa exception for UAE citizens will affect both the ADDED's activities abroad and Abu Dhabi's business footprint in Europe?</h4><p>Given the sincere desire of top officials in both the EU and the UAE to further enhance ongoing relations and deepen areas of mutual cooperation, the two sides have been capitalizing on emerging opportunities resulting from the sound foundations of energetic partnership and continuous support from leaderships. Traditionally, foreign trade has been a principal area of joint success between the two sides, and recent trade figures show that bilateral trade between the EU and the UAE increased by 7.4% in 2012 to reach ‚¬45.4 billion. In particular, the UAE has attracted total EU exports of approximately ‚¬37 billion, marking our national market as the largest export destination market for the EU's exports in the GCC market and the Arab world as well. Moreover, in terms of overall major trading partners, the UAE was among the EU's top 20 trading partners in 2012. In this regard, it is worth mentioning that the two allied partners have recently witnessed a key improvement in their relations, after the European Parliament Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice, and Home Affairs voted in favor of listing the UAE among those nations granted visa-free access to Schengen zone countries. The move is perceived as an important stepping stone toward the further deepening of ongoing relations and diversifying areas of mutual benefit. Cross-border education, tourism, medical treatment, and business travel are expected to gain huge momentum following this move.</p><h4>How do you assess GCC-EU relations over the last few years?</h4><p>For more than 20 years the EU-GCC mutual arena has been enjoying one of the most progressive reciprocal relations with tangible achievements. Overall regional trade between the two economic blocs increased from an approximate figure of ‚¬107 billion in 2008 to almost ‚¬144 billion in 2012, achieving an average annual growth rate of 7.7% over the period (2008-2012) compared with an average annual growth rate of 4.6% among EU's overall trade with the world during the same period. Accordingly, the GCC market is among EU's top trading partners, with the first reinforcing its leading position among top five export destination markets for EU's exports in 2012. The UAE's strategic location coupled with its unrivalled political and economic stability would strongly qualified it to act as an important gateway and vital corridor for mutual trade between Europe and key trade partners in Asia and Africa. Recent achievements have been greatly praised by several business groups as key leverage for global trade and growth as well.</p><h4>What are some of the key investment opportunities in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi that you would recommend?</h4><p>Despite the challenging conditions of the global financial system, Abu Dhabi's long-term road map for sustainable development, the Economic Vision 2030, remains unchanged with the Emirate's government keen on realizing its long-term goals, whereas Abu Dhabi's short-term objectives have been reviewed and reassessed effectively to maintain a high level of optimization between our resources and changing national and international realities. In 2012, the government announced a plan to re-energize a considerable list of government-led projects in the tourism, infrastructure, and transportation sectors, as well as the remarkable initiative launched by the government early in 2013, agreeing to pump AED330 billion ($90 billion) into development projects over the next five years, in addition to the latest commitment of more than AED15 billion to further advance the work at a number of key projects related to housing, health, roads, and electricity. Meanwhile, the changing landscape of the regional investment map coupled with its growth potential are significantly endorsing the UAE's position in general, and Abu Dhabi in particular, as a leading investment hub. Driven by unparalleled political stability matched with a competitive macroeconomic environment and remarkable investor confidence, our national economy has been globally recognized as the second largest destination for FDI flows in the Arab world in 2012, according to UNCTAD statistics. Vision 2030 targets FDI to capture 23% of GDP by 2030, placing investors at the top of our priorities with the prime aim to provide them with a bird's eye view supported by prestigious world-class services to reap emerging opportunities.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of Cartagena's hosting of a major PGA golf tournament in 2014? What does Colombia have to offer the international golf circuit?</h4><p>Colombia has many golf players today, and with such events we support the development of professional golf players in our country. The Colombian Golf Federation is an active organization in opening new golf courses, promoting the country as a golf destination, and supporting clubs in their development, and that of their most talented players. The locations of the country's diverse clubs are beautiful, and in addition we have golf courses with completely different designs, which offers players a range of golfing experiences.</p><h4>How did this club come about?</h4><p>The founders of our club were passionate football supporters of the Santa Fe club. In fact, the origin of the club is the great love of football among a group of close friends, including Gonzalo Rueda Caro, Simon Ferro, and Enrique Rodrí­guez, among others, who gave birth, in 1953, to what was known as the Club Campestre Santafé. Many of our members today are also passionate supporters of this club, and we have had the players of Santa Fe visiting our facilities several times. Today we have several sports modalities available to our members. Given the passion of its founders for football, a solid team was formed and their respect for the playing fields was so great that it became known as the “sacred ground." In fact, the quality of the club's football team was so great that they repeatedly invited professional teams like Santa Fe and Millonarios to play with them. During the bullfighting season, the “sacred ground" was used by masters such as Luis Miguel Dominguí­n “Chicuelo," Antonio Ordóñez, Damaso Gómez, César Girón, Pepe Cáceres, and Joselillo of Colombia, among others, who every year visited our court to share entertaining moments. When the Santa Fe Country Club changed its name to Club Campestre la Colina, football suffered a period of transition where other sports flourished. Later, thanks to the drive and desire for the continuous improvement of its partners, the Club Campestre la Colina, in its small but comfortable facilities, would be the origin of what we now know as the Club Campestre los Arrayanes. Undoubtedly the biggest change was the having the club move its headquarters from the grounds of the La Colina to the grounds of Los Arrayanes, which was made possible thanks to the acquisition of Los Arrayanes in 1972 under the direction of the Management Board, which was presided over by Pedro Gomez Barrero. Once in Los Arrayanes, and in 1976, the 18-hole course and the 22 tennis courts were built. By 1978 the 50-meter indoor pool and the head office, which by then was considered a great work of architecture and design, were built. A date to remember is August 27, 1977, the day the club was officially named Club Campestre Los Arrayanes. With this change came new sports, new developments, big goals, and great dreams.</p><div class="quote">“We have a number of international partnerships with clubs in Panama, Ecuador, Venezuela, and several other countries."</div><h4>What are some of the main services the club currently offers?</h4><p>We have a golf course for senior players and another one for children. There is also a practice golf course for training purposes. We have 70 children playing golf in our academies. We also have a consolidated and qualitative network of coaches. Regarding our tennis facilities, we have 22 tennis courts and several academies; there are over 220 children playing for our tennis academies at the moment. Let me say that some of our young players enjoy scholarships in the US on the strength of their talent, and we have high hopes for the future. We also have equestrian facilities for amateur and professional riders, and a 50-meter indoor pool and swimming schools. One of our strongest points is that we combine facilities for both professional and amateur practitioners, so everybody can enjoy their sport regardless of their level and purpose. Furthermore, we have a complete wellness and spa area with Turkish baths, beauty salons, and an area called Arrayalandia, which is a children's playground.</p><h4>What are some of the landmark achievements of your foundation since incorporation?</h4><p>The foundation was set up by the members to ensure that young workers at the club, including for example golf caddies, receive an education. This educational support extends also to the children of our employees. What's more, the foundation supports access to the housing market as well as financial support for the refurbishment of our workers' housing.</p><h4>What are the requirements and conditions of membership of Club Campestre Los Arrayanes?</h4><p>We offer four types of membership program; natural membership for Ps140 million, legal membership for Ps180 million, and alternate membership, a useful offer for those who travel and want to put their membership on hold (from six months to over two years), thereby opening a vacancy that is covered by a kind of lease on the membership. We also offer so-called adhering membership for companies whose employees or directors will be here for a short period of time.</p><h4>What role have partnerships with other clubs played in the expansion of the Los Arrayanes and what plans do you have for the future in this regard?</h4><p>We have a number of international partnerships with clubs in Panama, Ecuador, Venezuela, and several other countries. We are about to close exchange agreements with certain clubs in the US and Europe. We are open to expanding our international profile in the near future, as we know the importance of such agreements in offering added value to our members when traveling abroad. We also have partnerships with travel companies, which allow us to offer products to visitors in Colombia who want to use our facilities.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Within the Paris Gallery, what do you do to maintain the standard of quality for products in your portfolio?</h4><p>We explore consumer service through various forms of research, but collecting the data for this research is not an easy task. The more information we obtain, the greater the chance of confusion. We try to maintain the friendly, luxurious environments that consumers demand. These demands do not remain consistent and have to be transformed every few years. We work with our designers and business partners to ensure brand positioning and equity is maintained and improved. We work together to ensure that what we have in mind is in line with what consumers are demanding. When these business partners introduce new products or brands for our region, they come to us so that we can introduce their products properly to our consumers.</p><h4>You have 450 international brands in your portfolio. Which brands are you planning to acquire or work with in 2014?</h4><p>Much potential lies in the sectors of jewelry and skincare. To put this into perspective, the largest export item from Italy to the UAE is jewelry, and the numbers are increasing. Our focus for 2014 will be on the smaller jewelry houses. There is greater potential with these smaller houses for their designs to be more closely aligned with the future wants of consumers and new generations. This is not to say that the larger houses are not aligned with future consumer demand, but smaller houses are dynamic enough to meet the challenge. The essential challenge for these designers lies in finding the right location to exhibit their products. We help them to best exhibit their products, and we have the knowledge it requires to market these products.  The jewelry sector could expand to global importance, like those of perfume, cosmetics, and other luxury products. Worldwide, most small- and medium-sized businesses are struggling because these elements are missing. Yet these obstacles, over time, are overcome. Another challenge is designers not knowing what to design for particular markets. Currently, they tend to produce one product for the entire market, but this trend is changing. What is desired in China is different from India, which is in turn different from the GCC. We have summits every year that allow retailers, distributors, and the houses and creators to get together and talk about what needs to be done. There has always been potential in skincare, and that potential is still growing. The awareness of the customer is increasing for skincare—both for men and women. However, there are not enough products to meet this demand. The difficulty of producing effective skincare products is the main reason for this. Similar to jewelry, there are small businesses, creators, and entrepreneurs in that sector, and we would like to focus on this in 2014.</p><div class="quote">“Currently, there are 52 Paris Gallery stores in the Gulf and MENA region."</div><h4>What are your geographic expansion plans?</h4><p>Currently, there are 52 Paris Gallery stores in the Gulf and MENA region. We are hoping to open two showrooms in Muscat and one in Baghdad, and we also have plans for Libya and many other locations. Our plans for Baku are part of the scheme, although we have faced challenges there in terms of logistics. Before the end of this year, we will have many of those stores opened. We have been approached by many countries. In the UAE, most of our stores are being refurbished. We've opened new stores and have plans to open a few more in 2014. The Paris Gallery store in the Dubai Mall has also undergone a major facelift. We've also given Watch Gallery in the Mall of the Emirates an entirely new look and feel. We inaugurated our store at the Sahara Centre in Sharjah and opened a new store at the Al Ghurair Centre in Dubai.  In Abu Dhabi, we inaugurated a new Aigner fashion boutique.  A new Paris Gallery store is also slated to open in the Bawabat Al Sharq Mall in Abu Dhabi.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How successful has the e-government initiative been so far in regards to its goal of increasing efficiency?</h4><p>Let me put it this way, the E-government Agency (e-GA) is a fairly new government institution; it is only about two years old. But we began to leverage ICT for improved service delivery and efficiency even before e-GA was created. There have been some successes such as the Integrated Financial Management System and the Human Capital Management Information System. What e-GA is doing is to accelerate, improve, coordinate, and expand these efforts. We want to improve efficiency, to make the government more accessible and accountable to the general public, as well as to streamline, harmonize, and coordinate ICT in government. We also want to establish various standards for ICT applications across government departments, build capacity in ICT among the various ministries and departments, and install the related infrastructure. We already have in place the ICT optic fiber broadband backbone, and are now working on last mile connectivity issues to ensure we can connect as many government offices as possible. We are working on an integrated government-wide network to bring the whole government together and avoid unnecessary duplication and parallel systems. We are trying to create a closed government cloud that is accessible 24/7, along with a dedicated and secure government mailing system. Overall, we are fairly on track to achieve these targets. We are also trying to create a government service mobile platform so that citizens can access services on their mobile phones, which most people today have access to, without having to visit government offices. Not only will this save time and money for both citizens and the government, but by minimizing face-to-face contact between citizens and government officials we can reduce the opportunities for corruption.</p><h4>How has the increase in e-governance benefited Tanzania's open government initiative?</h4><p>Tanzania joined the open government initiative in 2011 because we strongly believe that the government should be more open to its citizens and, really, to have a more interactive government with an ongoing dialogue with its citizens. We believe in open government, and much of what the government does should be accessible to the public. In so doing we will empower the public to hold the government accountable. My other wish is that one day, for instance, a farmer will be able to use his mobile phone, take a picture of a crop that is not doing well, and upload it to agricultural extension officers, enabling the officers to provide a solution promptly. Or, if there is a water point in a city or rural area that is not working, someone can take a picture and upload it to the relevant officials who can locate it by GPS and arrange for immediate repair. This possibility is now not too far off, either. The technology is there; we just need to implement it. There is a cost in terms of human and financial resources. Yet, efficiency gains will ultimately compensate for the costs.</p><div class="quote">“We strongly believe that the government should be more open to its citizens."</div><h4>Tanzania also recently began implementing the Big Results Now (BRN) initiative. How would you rate the progress of the first year of this program?</h4><p>I think we have made very good progress considering the teething problems we encountered. We agreed as a government that this is what we are going to do and that we will closely monitor performance in Key Results Areas (KRAs) on a weekly basis to make sure that those implementing priority projects are always on track. This also helps to identify and resolve problems early on. The main problem was financing. Our philosophy is that a plan without a budget is only a draft. There is no point in giving someone Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) without the money to meet those targets. We identified six main KRAs. These are agriculture, education, resource mobilization, energy, central transport corridor, and water. We have just added a seventh KRA, which is business environment. I think we have done quite well in most of these priority areas. The latest evaluation results confirmed unprecedented performance, and attribute this to the new way of doing things. In education, for instance, we had intended to re-train about 3,500 teachers in new ways of delivering the curriculum and we have managed to train about 3,000, so we are almost on target and are beginning to see results in terms of school performance. With water, by June of 2014, after only one year of BRN, we were able to provide 2.8 million people in rural areas with connections to clean water. This is at least five times the highest rate we have ever achieved since independence in providing clean water to our citizens in a single year. Resource mobilization has helped us reduce the fiscal deficit from TZS6 trillion to TZS5.648 trillion because of the identified new sources of revenue. In energy, by June 2014, 36% of the population had access to the power grid. The connection rate is now at 24%, compared to only 10% in 2002 and 13% in 2007. The biggest jump occurred after we began to implement BRN.</p><h4>What are your priorities for 2015?</h4><p>I would say one of the priorities is national stability in the country—peace and stability. We live in a rather unstable region, whereby our chief concern is to make sure that Tanzania remains a peaceful and stable country—socially, politically, economically as well as in terms of security. We are a united country; religion is a person's private matter, as are political views or tribal affiliations. We want to remain united, peaceful, and stable. We are also working toward sustaining the economy's growth trajectory of around 7%, a rate we have on average attained for over ten years now. In 2015 we may see 7.2% growth if we keep all our macroeconomic fundamentals in place, such as low inflation of around 5% or less by June 2015. In other areas, we want to address obstacles to growth, such as infrastructure. Most of these obstacles to growth are factored into the BRN initiative. In energy, we need adequate, stable, reliable, clean, and affordable power. We are continuing to build roads across the country. We are building more roads now than we have ever done. We are fixing the existing central railway line even as we plan an entirely new standard gauge line. With a country the size of Tanzania, the opportunity is huge, but we have to build infrastructure for that opportunity to be realized. We are now building Terminal Three at the Julius Nyerere International Airport in Dar es Salaam, and there are other airports in other cities earmarked for development in 2015. I am extremely excited by the huge progress we are set to make over the next few years. An area we will keep a close eye on is natural gas. With over 50 tcf of gas discovered, and hopefully more to come, we can restructure and diversify our economy and build the foundations of a strong and resilient economy that can outlive these finite resources. We will continue to internalize global best practices in our policies, laws, and regulations to ensure we get this right. Next year is also an election year, so the priority here is to have a peaceful, free, and fair election and eventual transition to the fifth post-independence administration.</p><h4>With some 10 years left to achieve Vision 2025, how optimistic are you about meeting the set goals, especially considering the progress of recent years?</h4><p>I think we are going to get there. I am optimistic when I take into account what we have achieved so far, especially in the last few years. The reason we introduced the BRN initiative is because we began to worry that we wouldn't meet the targets. Now, with BRN, I am very confident that we will succeed. For example, the economy is growing at an average of 7% per annum, which is strong growth, and I am sure it will reach 8% in the near future. In per-capita income terms, it was $652.1 in 2012 ($742 in current US prices). But, we are now rebasing the data. From the initial figures we have, this will increase GDP substantially. The World Bank is trying to validate the numbers, but by September we should have the new GDP data. We expect the new data will confirm that we are now on track to becoming a middle-income country by 2025. Other important numbers include the extreme poverty rate, which was 9.7% in 2012 compared to 16.6% in 2007. People living below the basic needs line amounted to 28.2% in 2012, down from 33.6% in 2002. All this shows that we are on track, and all numbers point in the right direction. Life expectancy is now at 61 years, up from 50 years in 1988. Literacy is at 78.1%, up from 69% in 2002. When we look at these numbers, and with the commitment we have, we have every confidence that we will meet our 2025 targets. The future is optimistic.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

To get the international accreditations going and familiarize ourselves with the standards was, and still is, a key objective. That was the first part of the development of the university that the strategic plan needed to address. We are shifting our focus to the research mission of the university, and the way that mission will interact with both government needs and the needs of the industry stakeholders. We have started to populate the five thematic areas we identified through our research centers and large collaborative efforts with industries to support each one, which will be augmented by international partnerships. We have partnerships with the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Georgia Tech, and the University of Bristol, amongst others. Moving ahead with our research plan initiatives, joining up with other institutions in combined graduate programs, and the development of major research centers at the university will be our major goals. We have begun the physical expansion of our campus, and the first part of that is going to be available in late 2015. It will be more laboratory intensive to support the research centers' work and ongoing educational programs; however, it will also house the medical school eventually. Going ahead, that is set to be an important expansion for us as well.</p><h4>In terms of research centers, what specific fields or developments are included in Khalifa University's expansion?</h4><p>ICT is a major focus for the university. We already have the Etisalat BT Research Centre that will continue to grow and flourish. We have a new Aerospace Research Centre that we are undertaking with Mubadala Aerospace, and its focus is composite materials and airframe structures. One of the major stakeholders there is Strata Manufacturing PJSC (Strata) based in Al Ain. With both the Boeing and Airbus contracts that are coming to the UAE, there is a competitive opportunity for the UAE to lead in the automation of composite manufacturing. The question is, can we increase reliability while also reducing the cost by using more automation? The Aerospace Research Centre is a major new research center that is just getting going. We also have a Semiconductor Research Centre that we opened in collaboration with Mubadala's Advanced Technology Investment Company (ATIC), which is now entering its second year. Robotics is going to be a large deal for us along with high-performance computing and big data. These centers are still growing and need laboratory space beyond just classrooms and offices. We are going to have quite a bit of shelled space that we will build, but will not finish yet meaning that we can have some flexibility to increase space in a tailored way. We are also developing a student center. The goal is to create a place that students really feel like is theirs. The quality of student life will be a major need and focus of the new space.</p><h4>How do you see Khalifa University contributing to the realization of the Abu Dhabi Economic Vision 2030?</h4><p>Our first opportunity to really contribute to the Abu Dhabi Economic Vision 2030 is through human capital development. Khalifa University's role is to produce students that the industries really want to hire, that they see as being productive, and that advance their capability to do more work in-house. The reality in the UAE, both in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, is that much of the technical work has been outsourced because things have grown so fast. This is not true across the board, however. If you look at what Etisalat was able to do in the ICT sector, a lot of the ICT technology that is available here is fairly homegrown. The reasons for that have a lot to do with the fact that the UAE identified this need 25-30 years ago and started developing programs in universities that would produce people who could do this kind of work. If you look at infrastructure development, much of the high-end stuff is still outsourced; however, there is a reasonable amount of capacity here in country where young nationals who want to be construction managers or want be involved in major projects can do that. Until very recently, if you were a young person in the UAE and you wanted to work in those fields, you had to go the US or the UK to get your degree and then come back. With the new medical school, the UAE government is keen that students that go to this medical school will be able to qualify for top residencies, go and do a medical residency after they finish, and then come back and really be leaders in medicine here. The intended model for the program is designed to achieve this goal. In the near term, our biggest opportunity to contribute to the local economy is to offer young nationals the opportunity to study here and build the industries here. This contribution will have an almost immediate effect.</p><div class="quote">“Our first opportunity to really contribute to the Abu Dhabi Economic Vision 2030 is through human capital development."</div><h4>The support that Mubadala is giving to Khalifa University is also seen with other universities and research centers. How do you see the overall research and development landscape evolving in the future?</h4><p>I have witnessed a lot of evolution over the last four years I have been here. A key piece that needs to grow further is the government's direct support for research. We have seen starts on that in the region, most famously in Qatar with the Qatar National Research Fund (QNRF). Abu Dhabi has not quite taken that approach yet. I am not necessarily recommending this approach, but I would like to see a step in that direction. It would be helpful to the R&amp;D infrastructure here, and I think people in government realize this, both on the federal level and in Abu Dhabi. The need for a funding agency that can supplement what industry is able to do is going to be important in the long term. We have been fortunate that research was explicitly included in our mandate when the Royal Decree was issued. Our Board of Trustees and the Abu Dhabi government have been supportive of us in ensuring that we carve out budgetary resources for our faculty and students to do research.</p><h4>How would you assess the contribution of Khalifa University in creating the next generation of leadership in the field of energy, particularly in nuclear energy in the UAE?</h4><p>In nuclear as in everything else, it is not just development of research capacity, which we have done, but it is also the human capital development. We had the first Master's credential in the nuclear field in the Gulf, and we opened it in a very short period of time. The first plant is coming online in 2017. The Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation (ENEC) has human capital needs that are very aggressive. They need young, local, and technically trained leaders, not only in the ramp up to the operation of nuclear plants, but also once they are fully operational. The program is now up and running, and we are engaged with ENEC to think even more strategically and broadly about not only how the nuclear faculty we have can support their needs, but also how the rest of campus can support their needs as well. What we have really tried to do, together with ENEC, is to focus the research funds that we are spending together, and the partnerships we develop on the outside, on research problems that are really going to be relevant to the development of those plants here, and we are having pretty good luck with that. The energy picture in the UAE will be a combination of conventional, nuclear, and renewables—all of which are happening here. The education and training of people who can think holistically at the system level is going to be important.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you rate Oman's economic performance in 2013?</h4><p>Oman experienced stable GDP growth in 2013 supported by both an increase in oil production and a rise in government expenditure. According to the latest data published by the National Centre for Statistics and Information, nominal GDP grew 3% in 2013. The share of oil sector GDP was about 44% and non-oil GDP 56%. While Oman crude oil prices dropped from $109.60 in 2012 to $105.50 per barrel in 2013, oil production increased 2.3% to 343.8 million barrels per day (bbl/d) in 2013. Actual government spending in 2013 is estimated to be slightly above OMR16 billion, or 23% above the estimated spending, of which 63% is recurrent expenditure amounting to OMR10.08 billion (50% of the recurrent expenditure is allocated to civil ministries). The increase in government expenditure, compared with 2012 actual expenditure of OMR13 billion, reflects in part the government's focus areas on social development, including job creation for about 56,000 Omanis and increased spending on education and healthcare. In addition, government expenditure during 2013 focused on supporting the SME sector, increasing local and foreign investment in the private sector and initiating new industrial zones.</p><h4>Oman's economy is expected to grow by 5% in 2014. What factors are determining and supporting this achievement?</h4><p>On the basis of a World Bank report warning of an oil crunch in 2015, the Supreme Committee for Planning predicts that international oil prices will rise in 2014 and increased oil prices, hence income, have always had a positive impact on GDP growth. More importantly, fiscal expansion will maintain economic growth. In 2014, the government will increase its investment expenditure on development projects and maintain the current levels of public debt. In addition, the current emphasis on social development by giving priority to job creation in the private and public sector and increased spending on education, training, and healthcare will have a positive impact on output growth. The first Financial Stability Report (FSR) released by the Central Bank of Oman (CBO) in May 2013 expects that Oman's economic growth momentum will continue to be strong “driven primarily by public sector activities, backed essentially by domestic demand, characterized by an improved diversification of the economy, and reflected in the decline in the excess contribution of the petroleum sector to GDP growth vis-í -vis the non-petroleum sector, while the overall growth process is expected to be sustainable moving forward."</p><div class="quote">“Oman's FDI inflow has experienced steady growth since 2004."</div><h4>What role does the in-country value (ICV) strategy play in achieving the goals of diversification in Oman?</h4><p>The ICV strategy is a partnership between the government and companies that operate in the oil and gas sector. The strategy is to increase total the spending of firms for the benefit of business growth and human resource development, and induce output growth in the country. The government will give tender award preference to firms that are highly Omanized and to firms that have a clear Omanization program in place. The strategy will develop Omani managers and professionals for higher technical and managerial levels in the private sector.</p><h4>How is the Sultanate improving its attractiveness for FDI?</h4><p>Oman's FDI inflow has experienced steady growth since 2004. This increase in FDI is the result of a healthy macroeconomic environment and stable institutional framework including property law. The government allows up to 100% full ownership and investment in key strategic sectors including the oil sector. Furthermore, the government has been promoting competition in major economic sectors such as infrastructure, energy, and manufacturing. Government efforts are paying off. The country's competitiveness has been increasing. According to Ernst &amp; Young's 2012 attractiveness survey, Oman ranked as the 32nd most competitive country in the world. According to the study, in 2011, Oman enjoyed an increase of 66% in project numbers, an 89% increase in capital investment, and a 17% increase in new jobs.</p><h4>How is the government promoting and enabling environment for SMEs?</h4><p>SMEs employ more than half of the workforce in many countries. Furthermore, SMEs breed creativity, innovation, and stimulate economic growth. The government has been working very hard to promote the role of SMEs in the economy and in view of the importance of SMEs, the Public Authority for SME Development superseded the department of SMEs at the Ministry of Trade and Commerce. A royal decree initiated the Authority in 2013 with the goal of developing, planning, coordinating, and promoting the role of SMEs. In addition, it aims to enable SMEs to access credit and resources available at government and non-government agencies, promote the culture of entrepreneurship and self-employment among the youth and young people, strengthen the role of SMEs in the provision of sustainable employment opportunities, breed and foster initiatives and their implementation, management, and development, increase and promote the competitiveness of existing SMEs, and boost the capacity of SMEs to add value to the national economy, contribute to economic diversification, and support innovation and the use of modern technologies. Besides the current interest-free loans available to SMEs, the government is embarking on several steps to promote the role of SMEs, including a yearly award for the most successful SME and another award for the best supportive government and private institution for SMEs. There are also dedicated spaces for business administration centers and business incubators in all of the Sultanate governorates supported by both the government and the private sector, while the government will provide agricultural, industrial, and commercial land for SMEs on lease bases. Also, 10% of government procurement will be carried out through SMEs and large firms are required to dedicate 10% of the value of a government-awarded tender to SMEs. Government employees are additionally trained on how to serve the private sector, including SMEs. This includes education and awareness programs for staff and related government departments on issues such as the importance of the speedy handling of requests and permit issuance. Government employees who are also SMEs owners are also allowed one year paid leave to run and manage their businesses. A review of current commercial laws is also underway in order to simplify further requirements and procedures and create a business friendly environment for SMEs. In short, the government aims to create the best and most attractive environment for business owners, especially SMEs.</p><h4>What are the government's priorities for 2015?</h4><p>One of the current and ongoing priorities for the government is infrastructure deployment. About 50% of the eighth Five-Year Development Plan (2011-2015) has been used to maintain and overhaul roads, ports, and airports with an object to link all three modes of transport (air, land, and sea). This will include a number of airports, roads, bridges, and national railway networks being developed over the coming years. Developing a modern infrastructure and integrated logistics and transport network is an essential part of Oman's economy diversification strategy. In addition, this will increase the speed of diversification away from petroleum sector activities. This would expand the sources of growth, create employment opportunities for nationals in the private sector, and induce further development of agriculture, manufacturing, and services. Another priority of the government is education. During 2010, 2011, and 2012, education expenditure reached 4.6% of GDP and 13% of the 2013 budget. This ratio will be maintained throughout 2014 and 2015.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Oman's economy in the medium term?</h4><p>The outlook for growth remains positive. Downside risk includes creating job opportunities for the increasing number of young Omani job seekers. According to the population statistics of 2012, the broad base of the pyramid population mean that those under 29 years old are the majority of the population (68% of the population) and, therefore, Oman is one of the countries that has what is known as a youth bulge, where the majority of the population are young people. In addition, the Supreme Committee of Planning predicts that, by 2040, the population in Oman will be around 5.4 million, of which about 33% will be non-Omani, while the number of Omani job seekers will be around 1.2 million in 2040. Economic growth will be largely driven by the hydrocarbon sector with an increasing share for manufacturing industries such as petrochemicals, aluminum smelting, fertilizers, and other resource-based industries.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>South Africa and Saudi Arabia are both high growth G20 economies. Since 1994, when Nelson Mandela visited Saudi Arabia and began diplomatic relations, how have trade ties between the two nations evolved?</h4><p>Since the visit of former President Nelson Mandela to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1994, trade ties between the two countries have steadily progressed. Former President Mandela described Saudi Arabia as an important and influential country in the Middle East, and it remains a valued and strategic partner for South Africa in the region. This is underscored by the fact that Saudi Arabia is currently South Africa's major supplier of oil. Our oil imports from Saudi Arabia totaled ZAR72.903 billion ($6.87 billion) in 2013, representing about half of our total crude imports. The reality is also that our reliance on Saudi crude has led over the years to a significant trade deficit between the two countries. The focus is currently on encouraging a significant increase of exports to the Kingdom in order to offset the trade deficit.</p><h4>Saudi Arabia is among the world's largest exporters of capital, and in 2013 South Africa was among the world's top destinations for foreign investment. How will FDI from Saudi Arabia to South Africa be facilitated over the coming years?</h4><p>In 2012, a ZAR20 billion joint investment fund, the Saudi Arabia-South Africa Holding Company, was established with investment in priority sectors, including mining, petrochemicals and agro-processing being its main focus. In addition, the South African government offers an array of incentive schemes to stimulate and facilitate the development of sustainable, competitive enterprises by providing accessible incentives that effectively support national priorities. A variety of incentive schemes seek to support the development or growth of commercially viable and sustainable enterprises through the provision of either funding or tax relief, thereby ensuring the creation of new and sustainable jobs. The government of South Africa and its private sector therefore encourage international investors to explore and favorably consider the major investment projects in South Africa, which will ensure high-levels of returns on their investments.</p><div class="quote">“Africa looks forward to the expansion of trade as well as inward investment into its myriad investment opportunities with the GCC."</div><h4>How would you characterize the importance of Africa-GCC trade to both parties in light of the continuing economic recovery in developed markets?</h4><p>Africa looks forward to the expansion of trade as well as inward investment into its myriad investment opportunities with the GCC to help it overcome the challenges of security, poverty, inequality, and unemployment. Africa is a fast-growing region and government-private partnership deals to boost trade and investment with the economically strong GCC region would be to their mutual benefit. The GCC countries have the major benefit of having extensive capital in the billions of US dollars in their sovereign wealth funds (SWFs), which are used for investments abroad. The African continent with its high growth now and into the future will present the GCC member states and their SWFs with opportunities for high returns on their investments. The expansion of inter-Africa-GCC trade and investment go hand-in-hand in benefitting the long-term advantage of the peoples in both regions.</p><h4>Where do you hope to see relations and trade between South Africa and Saudi Arabia in the year 2020? What initiatives are pushing those ambitions forward today?</h4><p>We fully expect that the bilateral trade deficit between our two countries will have lessened considerably with increasing use being made of the high-quality South African goods, products, and services in the Middle East. We also expect that the level of inward investment into South Africa from Saudi Arabia and the Middle East region will have increased considerably given the highly lucrative returns that such investments will reap. The existing Economic, Trade, Investment and Technical Co-operation Agreement with Saudi Arabia and the annual Joint Economic Commission between the two countries will continue to provide the framework and structural mechanism through which multi-faceted bilateral relations are promoted, with a specific focus on the promotion and strengthening economic, trade, and investment. South Africa is open and ready to do business and we will remain so.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Pfizer is present in almost every country in the world. What is the significance of the Ecuadorean market?</h4><p>Pfizer ranks number four in Ecuador's pharmaceutical market, and has been present in Ecuador for nearly 60 years. With more than 100 products in the market, we are active in virtually all therapeutic segments. We employ 140 colleagues across our three pharmaceutical offices nationwide. Pfizer Ecuador will continue to strengthen its portfolio, as it is an important market for the company in Latin America.</p><h4>Does strengthening your portfolio mean broadening into other healthcare areas that are not currently your strengths in Ecuador?</h4><p>At this time, we are focused on strengthening our portfolio in existing areas, rather than expanding it into different ones. We have an important presence in many therapeutic areas, such as cardiovascular, nervous system, and oncology. This year we will have launched four new medicines in diverse segments, including pain, oncology, and rheumatoid arthritis. We have had the opportunity to launch different molecules that are well known worldwide, as well as others that have been recently launched in markets such as the US. We want to maintain and strengthen our portfolio in Ecuador, with the end goal being to have as many products domestically as we do worldwide. Every day, within Pfizer's walls, our colleagues are searching for innovation with a purpose. On a daily basis, Pfizer is working to create new state-of-the-art medicines having entirely new mechanisms of action.</p><h4>What would you identify as the key factors driving growth in Ecuador's pharmaceutical market today?</h4><p>We have two different channels for growth in Ecuador: the trade channel and the institutional channel. While we have different strategies for each, the goal is always to strengthen the volume and patients' access to quality medicines. Access is the driving force behind our strategies for both channels.</p><div class="quote">“We have two different channels for growth in Ecuador: the trade channel and the institutional channel."</div><h4>You have mentioned the concept of access. What do you mean by that?</h4><p>Access means the ability to serve as many patients and communities as possible and to broaden the pathologies our medicines can cover. Our goal is to enable patients to have easy and affordable access to the best medicines and treatments for their health conditions.</p><h4>Is your relationship with the government an important part of your business?</h4><p>The government is, without a doubt, an important partner for us. We share the same goal of serving as many patients as possible. We are a provider for the government, and we take that responsibility very seriously. For example, we have innovative oncology drugs for several types of cancer available in the public sector, as well as primary care products that cover a wide variety of patients.</p><h4>How has Ecuador's approach to compulsory licensing affected the way you do business here?</h4><p>This is a very important issue. Threats of compulsory licenses create uncertainty in the business environment. We believe that unwarranted or routine compulsory licensing of patents undermines innovation incentives, and could result in fewer new medicines being developed. The protection of intellectual property is vital to the progress of medicine; it is the driving force behind pharmaceutical companies continuing to research and develop medicines that treat incurable diseases and other unmet medical needs. As such, we believe that the unwarranted compulsory licensing of a patented medicine is counterproductive to innovation in the health sector and jeopardizes the future welfare of patients.</p><h4>Do you feel that the government is open to dialogue with the pharmaceutical industry on these issues?</h4><p>We certainly believe that productive dialogue is possible with the government and we are grateful for those individuals and offices who have explored these important issues with us. We look forward to continuing our dialogue this way.</p><h4>What is your approach to human capital and providing development opportunities for your staff?</h4><p>Pfizer's success is due to the incredible talent of my colleagues. One of my main goals has been to continue developing talent within the company. Over the past two years, I have had the opportunity to provide career opportunities to 20 colleagues. I believe in helping colleagues achieve their goals by helping them have a strong understanding of the market and enhancing their academic background. We have very talented people in Ecuador, and I believe in opportunity for all. I am also proud of the fact that over 50% of our employees are women. A lot of them are mothers. We are proud to be a company that is good to mothers. We understand and value the importance of balancing one's personal and professional life.</p><h4>Looking ahead, how do you perceive Pfizer in Ecuador in five to 10 years' time?</h4><p>In that time frame, we hope to be in a position of increased strength, with an expanded portfolio and operations in Ecuador so that we can continue to provide to as many patients as possible the best gold-standard products across different therapeutic areas. Our goal is to remain a leader in the pharmaceutical space and to be respected by society.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Panama is the main banking center in Latin America. What are the benefits of investing in the Panamanian banking sector?</h4><p>Panama offers various benefits for investors in the financial and banking sector. It is an open, globalized economy, and also a dollarized one. Strategically located geographically, it is hub that connects 68 destinations worldwide, and also has excellent fiber optic connectivity for data exchange. The International Banking Center (IBC) has a 40-year history, having been established in 1970. It boasts a skilled and trained banking and finance workforce. From here it is a simple matter to serve clients and financial institutions throughout Central America, the Caribbean, and the northern part of South America.</p><h4>Both the Superintendency and the Banking Association are trying to attract new investors and members to the IBC. How many banks are members?</h4><p>There are 91 licensed banks within the IBC. Of those 91 banks, 13 are representative offices that allow banks and financial institutions to promote and conduct business from an office in Panama, although they are not allowed to provide banking services in Panama. We also hold an international banking license, which allows banks to take their services to clients beyond Panama, to take deposits from abroad, and to extend loans to other countries. Just 28 of our members are thus licensed. The remaining 50 hold a general license, which allows banks to operate in the local market and abroad, so they can perform local and international business at all times. We try to attract new members by promoting the advantages of using Panama as a base from which to perform banking and financial operations throughout Latin America, as well as the local market. Ideally, we would like to attract at least three important financial institutions to Panama by the end of 2014.</p><h4>The assets of the IBC grew by 7.6% YoY in June of 2014. How would you evaluate the performance of the IBC in 2013, and of the overall economy?</h4><p>The growth of the IBC has been impressive, and remains so in 2014 with a rising growth trend in evidence. Assets saw an increase of 7.6% in June 2014, and we evaluate the international and general licensed banks together. Internal credit to the private sector grew 8.7% compared to the same period in 2013. All indicators point to continued solid growth and efficiency, and the banks have strong rates of capital adequacy, making for a healthy environment. Meanwhile, the broader economy is also continuing to grow in 2014, albeit at a slower pace than in recent years. The banking sector will continue to contribute to Panama's continued growth by financing the growth of the nation. In terms of credit growth, the main drivers are the retail and construction sectors. We continue to hold great expectations both for the IBC and the banking sector as a whole.</p><div class="quote">“There have been changes throughout the year, with new players entering the banking sector and some exiting it."</div><h4>In terms of the regulatory framework, how does Panama compare to other countries in the region?</h4><p>The regulatory framework is comparable to those of other countries in the region. It is solid and in accordance with best practices and international standards. We might also mention capital adequacy, liquidity, corporate governance, and risk management. We keep track of these metrics to keep pace with global advances and developments. Regulations have consistently been updated over the past few years, and we have a roadmap to keep adjusting banking sector regulations to match international standards. Today, we are prioritizing capital adequacy, liquidity standards, and updating regulations pertaining to market risk.</p><h4>There were two important operations in the banking sector in 2013, namely the acquisition of HSBC in Panama by Bancolombia and BBVA by BAC International Bank, Inc. What impact have these had on the banking sector?</h4><p>There have been changes throughout the year, with new players entering the banking sector and some exiting it. The IBC remains very attractive to international players and investors. A player withdrawing does not denote a loss of assets, but that those assets have changed hands, having passed on to strong institutions, as demonstrated by those two examples from last year. There may be more mergers and acquisitions in the future, given the diverse size of the banks and considering that regulation is a significant burden for small- and medium-sized banks. Such entities are therefore more likely to seek mergers with other institutions for future growth.</p><h4>What challenges do the 91 IBC members face this year?</h4><p>Regulation poses a challenge. Capital adequacy and liquidity requirements mean that banks have to invest more capital, which stiffens competition. Furthermore, transparency, anti-money laundering initiatives, and anti-terrorism financing laws require improvements and changes to the legal framework, which, too, will place a burden on financial institutions. Banking is the most regulated and supervised sector in Panama, and this environment needs to be expanded to other sectors as well. Panama has an important task in terms of improving the transparency of the sector, and we are advancing in that direction.</p><h4>The country has signed 19 double taxation agreements. What are your predictions for the next OECD review of the country?</h4><p>We still have to get past phase II of that review, and have to consider changes to our legal framework accordingly. Last year we passed a law for the immobilization of better shares, but the timing was not right for the law to come into effect. This is one issue that the country needs to address, and the plan is to modify the law some time in the second half of this year. We have to move forward and keep making improvements to meet OECD requirements as well as Financial Action Task Force requirements for money laundering and terrorism financing. These are the issues we are addressing currently.</p><h4>What does the Superintendency foresee for the Panamanian economy in the coming years?</h4><p>We expect the economy to see continued growth. Ours is a solid economy, unique in the region, with its economic, political, and social stability keeping investors attracted. The sector contributes considerably to the economic growth of the country, providing not just financing to the local economy, but also to those of the region as a result of the international operations executed from Panama.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main goals and landmark achievements of the Strategic Health Plan 2013-2018?</h4><p>President Peña Nieto has identified the health sector as one of the government's five strategic pillars. His aim is to make Mexico a more inclusive country, with higher levels of security, global responsibility, and greater education, becoming a nation prepared for future challenges. One of the first reforms President Peña Nieto advanced was that of the education system, and today he has the health sector in sight. Back in 1983, Mexico had already determined healthcare to be the right of all Mexicans. Indeed, our constitution stipulates a right to protect health. Subsequently, a general health law followed. The law has seen numerous amendments over the past couple of decades, with an accompanying modernization of public health institutions to establish a strong national health system. The office of the Secretary of Health was created in 1943, but back then it had a stronger focus on providing assistance. Since then, we have also seen the establishment of the main national health institutions, and it was only in 1985 when the Ministry of Health was established in the form it takes today. It has been restructured following Mexico's move to a decentralized health system, in which each state assumes health responsibilities. This process was strengthened during the 1990s, and today each of the 32 states has its own Health Secretary. In 2004, the government of Mexico established the social security system. Ever since then, we have been strengthening this system with the inclusion of a larger number of diseases, the treatment of which is covered by social security.</p><h4>How has the social security system taken shape since 2004?</h4><p>In 2014, we will celebrate its 10th anniversary; initially it started out with 5 million affiliated members, while today the number is at 55.6 million. In terms of diseases and surgical procedures, it initially covered around 90, but today encompasses over 300. We have an economic fund allocated to the treatment of rare and high-cost-related diseases; 10 years ago we only included leukemia for children, while today we include a pool of over 60 such diseases based on epidemiological data. Overall, the achievements over the past decade have been formidable; we have increased the coverage of social security, and the number of affiliates, while people are more aware of their entitlements. The allocation of funds among the states is done according to the number of affiliates each has, and we have an extensive portfolio of free medicines for the public. The social security system also allocates a budget to provide full-coverage insurance for children under five years of age. Today, we are in the process of strengthening our control over the general allocation of funds and their administration in the different states.</p><h4>How has the presence and demand of generic medications changed in Mexico over the past few years?</h4><p>I have been part of the evolution of generic medications in Mexico. It has been a process requiring considerable effort from both the authorities and the manufacturers. One of the key steps we took was the signing of a commercial purchase agreement for state authorities, proving before the eyes of consumers the quality of these medications. We then distributed them through the social security system. Additionally, the amendment to the general health law of 2005 brought a positive change; it led to the renewal of health registers with stricter and more reliable control parameters. These steps have led to a situation today in which we have a wide portfolio of generic medications that are well positioned in the market. Those who use them know their properties, and we must continue working in this direction.</p><div class="quote">“I have been part of the evolution of generic medications in Mexico."</div><h4>Since more than 30% of Mexico's population suffers from obesity, what measures are being implemented to address the situation?</h4><p>This is a serious condition Mexico has suffered from for the past 20 years. The latest data, released in 2012, indicates that 34% of Mexico's population suffers from obesity and 38% are overweight. In other words, one out of every three children is obese. The government, through the Health Secretary, has already approved its strategy for tackling the problem; we are set to strengthen health education, and will also provide integrated health care for such diseases to prevent complications related, for example, to diabetes. We will also strengthen the network of primary healthcare facilities in terms of staffing, especially in rural areas of the country. Meanwhile, we will step up efforts in the legal and advertising spheres increasing the tax burden for unhealthy food and drinks. We are aware of the long road ahead of us and require the participation of all parties, not only the health institutions, as this is also a social problem. In this context, we are set to establish a citizens' watchdog that will be bringing all parties involved under the same umbrella to better join efforts and tackle the problem. This citizens' watchdog will also be an external evaluator of our strategy to better analyze our developments.</p><h4>How would you assess the role of R&amp;D activities as a driver for future developments in the health sector in Mexico?</h4><p>Our goal is to push forward a new reform of the health system in order to reach a situation of universal healthcare in Mexico. We also need to increase cooperation between all public health institutions, especially when it comes to people affiliated with popular insurance and social security, to offer better services to patients. This will help us to reduce costs and increase portability in terms of services. Finally, we also need to step up efforts to improve the quality of the service the public health system offers in terms of reducing waiting lists and improving the treatment of patients. Lastly, we need to increase efforts regarding prevention and the changing of social trends and habits of people, so we can reduce the prevalence of many diseases.</p><h4>What is the potential for Mexico to become a leading destination in health tourism?</h4><p>This area is still in the early stages of development; however, we already have a joint project with the Secretary of Tourism to develop a common strategy in this area. Mexico has all the conditions necessary to become a popular destination within the health tourism industry, and we will take important steps over the next couple of years. In this context, I think the northern states could take the lead very soon.</p><h4>What segments of the health industry offer the greatest potential to attract foreign investment?</h4><p>I personally believe that the technological segment within the health industry, as well as infrastructure, are the two spheres offering the most attractive potential for investment. We will be witnessing interesting projects in the near future within the framework of public-private partnerships. For example, we have already built six hospitals within this scheme in Mexico, and the feedback thus far has been highly positive.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of the recent agreement to bring a PGA tournament to Cartagena?</h4><p>This is a great opportunity to continue showcasing Colombia to the world; golf in Colombia has advanced enormously in the last few years, both in terms of infrastructure and also the level of professional players. I think there are still many stereotypes regarding the situation in our country that no longer resemble reality, and such an important event will help us to show what Colombia is really about now. Also, we have some very talented players who are ready to take a step forward in their careers.</p><h4>What does Colombia have to offer to golf players?</h4><p>It is offers a wide variety of golf courses—Colombia is a very rich country in terms of its biodiversity and geography, and this is reflected in the many different courses we have available for players. This also means a variety of levels of complexity in the game. We are also very innovative in terms of design. For example, our golf course goes along a surface where there are houses too; the course was developed as part of a highly regarded residential project. The construction of the entire project started 18 years ago. Over the past few years, Pradera de Potosí­ has become one of the leading golf courses in the country, providing some of the most interesting game offerings to players. We have organized an amateur golf tournament for over a decade, and in 2014 we went one step further and organized the first professional tournament here. Therefore, we can say that Pradera de Potosí­ has matured as a golf course, and we have high expectations for the future.</p><div class="quote">“We have been the leader in the development of residential and sports infrastructure projects in the area."</div><h4>With the recent success of Santiago Giraldo, the Colombian tennis player, in the ATP rankings, how would you characterize the demand for this sport in Colombia?</h4><p>There's also a great opportunity to develop more professional infrastructure for tennis in Colombia, and raise the overall competitive level in the country. Tennis represents a sport with the highest percentage of participation, despite not being a very popular sport in Colombia. However, I think that as players like Santiago Giraldo continue to be successful in ATP tournaments, we will experience an increase in demand for the sport. Also, I think tennis represents one of the best examples of the professionalization and development of a sport from scratch in our country—today we have academies and master centers that provide the opportunity for talented players to pursue their dreams. I think one of the major challenges for this and other sports is the lack of economic resources for their further development, as well as for the support of talented players.</p><h4>What's the background story of Club la Pradera de Potosí­?</h4><p>We formally set up the project in June 1996 through the real estate developer Potosí­ La Pradera SA. However, some of the security issues that the country faced back then delayed the realization of the project. After some years and a restructuring of the project, in 2001 the Cluba la Pradera de Potosí­ took a decisive step toward its future development. Today, we talk about a project that it was predicted would be for 680 members, plus 100 children of our members. At the moment, we have around 660 members. The main concept behind our project is to provide entertaining alternatives for families.</p><h4>How has the development of high-end residential projects evolved in the area since the establishment of Club la Pradera de Potosí­?</h4><p>We have been the leader in the development of residential and sports infrastructure projects in the area. I think the local area, due to its proximity to Bogotá and the lack of space in the capital, has become a regional point for capitalizing on the development of these kinds of projects. After all these years, we have seen highly dynamic development in the area—at the moment, there are 65 urban development projects in the zones neighboring La Pradera, and they have matched our high standards to develop their projects. Therefore, we have been a pioneer and leading institution in terms of the development of urban and sports infrastructure.</p><h4>What are some of the highlights of your social responsibility activities?</h4><p>We regard action for social and environmental responsibility as an integrated part of our overall activity. In this context, we have a foundation that engages with many activities for our members and the entire region. We have implemented several programs through our foundation related to fields such as education and entertainment. We have also taken positive steps toward the preservation of the environment and the prevention of floods in the area, the recovery of river basins, and the preservation of river ecosystem areas. We are very active and interact at a very high level with the community, and we will continue to do so in the future.</p><h4>What are the highlights of your policies toward staff?</h4><p>We currently have around 350 direct employees, meaning that we are a large employer in the region. We care very much about our employees and we provide them with education and training opportunities to finish their studies or master some specific skills. We also have several cooperation agreements with universities to offer higher education alternatives to our staff. We also have an agreement with CEMEX to facilitate housing access for our employees. These kinds of opportunities also include our sports facilities, as we encourage our staff to have a healthy lifestyle.</p><h4>What does the club currently offer?</h4><p>In terms of our offerings, we are one of the most complete social clubs in Colombia; we have 10 different categories of sport available, we have the longest golf course in the region, we have 18 tennis courts, we have a large and highly developed equestrian area, many different swimming pools, a football pitch, squash courts, billiards, and bowling alleys. In addition, we have all the services offered by other social clubs, including massage, beauty, spa facilities, health, and wellness.</p><h4>Does La Pradera de Potosí­ have agreements with other social clubs in Colombia and abroad?</h4><p>We have already held some talks with social clubs in the US and Spain, and we hope to reach agreements with them in the near future. At the moment, we are in the process of deepening our international connections. At the national level, we already have these cooperation agreements with many of the main cities in Colombia, including Cali, Medellí­n, Bucaramanga, and others.</p><h4>What membership options does the club offer to foreign citizens?</h4><p>We have a type of membership called a “diplomatic visitor" package, and also offer temporary membership plans. There are also a number of alternate membership plans that we offer; for example, people can visit our club as a substitute for the main member when he or she is abroad and cannot attend the club. In fact, we have people residing in La Pradera who are from other nations, such as Mexicans, Argentineans, Venezuelans, and Chileans, who have taken part in the development of the club in the last few years. We are very open to foreign citizens and welcome their interest in our club.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

How has Salam International since grown with the local economy?</h4><p>Most family companies start the same way. Throughout the whole area, there was very little wealth. We consistently grew with the economy and we have managed to continue my father's business. My father passed away in 1982 and we took over the business. We are five brothers and each of us was responsible for a certain area. From there, we developed and grew. Today, the bigger the economies are, the bigger the companies are. We stayed the course and we have developed ourselves quite well. The most important thing is that we have a deeply rooted history in the economy and that helped us a lot. In 1952, my father started the business and went international in 1966 in Abu Dhabi and in Dubai in the late 1960s, then Muscat in the 1980s. We grew from there into different areas.</p><h4>How do you manage your portfolio to ensure a stable stream of revenue?</h4><p>Salam International has diversified its business interests. We have divided our business into five sectors; real estate, technology, retail, construction, and oil and gas. Under each of those sectors sits a number of companies that are managed by a managing director specialized in his line of business. They manage the business, project flows, and they have budgets, which are reported to the head office. Being diversified means less volatility and more stability. Our company has five legs, and it can move around. This is like the 1940s and 1950s used to be in Europe. Most of the new companies are specialized. Because we are in a developing economy, it is working so far.</p><div class="quote">“We have divided our business into five sectors; real estate, technology, retail, construction, and oil and gas."</div><h4>What has been the investment strategy in the real estate business?</h4><p>In real estate, we are conservative players. We developed a project called the Gate Mall in Doha, and we have a few other properties; however, right now we are not investing more in real estate when it comes to the company. It is quite a conservative policy that we are taking in real estate. We are investing more in whatever is operational.</p><h4>What is the most important pillar of your company in terms of revenue?</h4><p>Retail is important, followed by technology; it varies. Construction used to be the strongest pillar, but right now the economy has not yet picked up in Doha. The main 10-12 construction companies usually perform much better than they are currently. The market is a little tough at the moment, and the competition is strong. We are surviving, but it should pick up by the end of 2014. I expect to see a boom in the construction industry by that point.</p><h4>What is your advice to companies that want to take family businesses public?</h4><p>We were the first company in Qatar to go public, though have been through really tough times. The market in Qatar, when we started 10 years ago, was still undergoing a learning curve. The rules and regulations were not clear. We went through a rough ride with the legislative bodies. We started the fund in 1996. Then, in 2002 and 2005 we went through our first, second, and third mergers. We took it in steps; however, in the last 10 years, when the company was a fully public shareholding company, we had some difficulties with the legislative body. Right now, it is settling down; therefore, I think our experience was not great, but it was an important step, not only for us, but also for Qatar. Today, it is showing results and has improved. The market is maturing gradually, but it has a long way to go.</p><h4>Would you advise other companies to follow your lead?</h4><p>Yes, if they are willing to take on the challenges of becoming a public shareholding company and go through the learning curve. Switching the mindset from a private company to a public company is not simple. Even my mindset now is that I own shares, not the company. This is the mindset that the families have to realize and accept. Everybody should worry about their shareholding, but the performance of the company is the responsibility of the management. You have to regulate your books and processes. It is quite tedious work. I will leave it up to other companies to judge; it depends on what their objectives are.</p><h4>Could you talk about your international operations?</h4><p>We are a regional company, though not exactly international. We operate in the GCC and Levant area, from Lebanon to Jordan and across the countries of the GCC. That is our footprint right now, operationally. We have investments in Saudi Arabia and different places, and we have operations in five markets: Oman, UAE, Qatar, Lebanon, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia. We manage the company in those markets. In the future, we are looking to expand. It is a generic style of growth, because we completed all our investments in the last five years. We upgraded our systems, and now we are in Phase II of upgrading the management and financial systems. We are leaving it to the managing directors to take the company to new heights.</p><h4>There are many international expectations of Qatar. What are the main challenges you can identify in this process of economic growth?</h4><p>The problem is that it is over publicized in the media. Qatar is a small economy. Unfortunately, there is an oversell of Qatar. While many countries were suffering during the recession, Qatar was sticking its neck out and talking about megaprojects. Actually, in reality, they are humble projects. It is a boom for the people of Qatar, but not for the world. Many companies entered the Qatari market and were disappointed. They came for a project, did the project, but then there was no continuity of work. While the country has a strong economy in the oil and gas industry—and it is a very strong player in the world in that segment—that is about it. In five to seven years, many major infrastructure projects will finish, and the country will then experience more normalized growth. It is a window of opportunity now when the boom will continue. We don't see Qatar becoming a destination like Dubai; it is a small country, and I think it will stay small. There will be some activities and development in the oil and gas fields, and a little bit in the SME sector, but that's it. Our tourism is limited to a special niche in the market. I don't think there is an intention from the government to open it up to become a destination like Dubai. The parameters and outlook are different, and there is no need for the country to become a tourism destination in a big way.</p><h4>How does the Qatar National Vision 2030 inspire you in doing your business, and how will you contribute?</h4><p>The most important thing is that there is great focus on two things: education and medical care. Those are the two major initiatives that will provide the country with a healthier economy. Education and health are the basis for development. Right now, we have an excellent number of universities, and these are attracting many young people. Everyone wants their children to have a better education, and that is now available in Qatar. The quality of the children graduating now from universities is excellent. In five to 10 years, we will see a new generation that is very well educated and ready to take over responsibilities in a good way. That is really the road to 2030. Those are the two pillars that will take the country forward and achieve the vision.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What prompted Liberty Seguros to enter the Ecuadorean market?</h4><p>Liberty has a large footprint in Latin America. We started operations in the region in 1995-1996 by entering the market in Venezuela and Colombia. We subsequently entered Chile, Brazil, and Argentina. The intention of the group is to keep developing its footprint not only in Latin America, but in emerging markets worldwide, for example in Asia and Europe. The Ecuadorean market has been of great interest to the group for a number of years. In 2012 the regulator essentially divested the insurance business from the banking sector in Ecuador, which created an opportunity for Liberty to enter the market. Also, the market has grown significantly over the past decade, in fact exceeding GDP growth, although it is still a small market. Premiums in Ecuador border $1.7 billion today, which makes it an interesting niche market to enter. Therefore, a combination of factors was involved in our decision to enter the country. I think it is preferable to maintain our momentum and keep entering additional countries in Latin America because having a greater footprint is beneficial. Another positive about the Ecuadorean market is that the insurance penetration level remains low. As the population's purchasing power increases, this creates opportunities to sell insurance.</p><h4>Over the past 10 years Ecuador has seen an economic transformation. Do you think that has changed the nature of the insurance market?</h4><p>I think all factors are connected. When the economy is doing well and the purchasing power of the middle class is increasing, then there are more opportunities to sell insurance to that class. Certainly it is important to recognize that when there is an appropriate and stable economic and political climate, it is also a good time to do business and seek foreign investment.</p><h4>What is the significance of Ecuador for Liberty globally?</h4><p>I believe Ecuador to be an important market for us. It is developing, and one where we can find an interesting niche and incorporate best practices from other companies in the group worldwide. And certainly we are starting to do that. The market is changing and evolving into something better. This is not only because Liberty is here, as a good number of foreign multinational companies have entered the market and we expect to have competition based on services, improving technologies, and the further organizing of the sector as a whole. This is all extremely positive. Another factor here is related to growth, where GDP growth in 2014 is at around 4.5% and for the insurance market is at approximately 12%, meaning there is a sizeable room for competition. Stability over the past decade is another important factor. In the past, Ecuador saw 10 presidents in 10 years; however, since President Correa came to power in 2007 we have seen stable government. This is quite positive and has been coupled with solid economic results. There is stability in terms of inflation; Ecuador has controlled it well, which in Latin America is unique and important. Unemployment has dropped significantly over the years, and there has been huge investment in the wellbeing of people and in infrastructure projects. Since 2006 investments relative to GDP have approximately doubled. We advanced from investment in infrastructure and government at 2.6% of GDP in 2006 to 5.3% in 2009. All these are indicators of an appropriate market to enter and compete in as a multinational.</p><div class="quote">“The market is changing and evolving into something better."</div><h4>Ecuador has a competitive insurance sector where most companies compete on price. Do you see Liberty taking a different approach to distinguish itself in the market?</h4><p>In general, Liberty competes in markets that operate with good services. Price is of course important in insurance; however, aside from that factor, we always work in all our operations around the globe to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. For example, we value customer relations, pay claims in record time, issue policies within an appropriate timeframe, and have all the necessary data in place to give our customers a better experience when dealing with us. We are still competing on price in the segments of the industry that we believe are profitable for the company. And we undertake extensive data analysis in order to categorize risks, so that we can offer different rates for different risks. Hence, we offer a very competitive price for good risks. It is just that we don't see price as the only mechanism for competing in the market. It is a much more complicated mix of factors. Service also encompasses how we serve our distributors, such as giving them technological tools to make doing business with us, and their final customers, easy. Also, we make sure that communications and an understanding of the products are clear for our distributors, who are mainly brokers.</p><h4>Do you see significant growth potential in the individual and corporate health and life segments in Ecuador?</h4><p>I do indeed, because as long as the population increases its purchasing power, and the middle class continues to grow, there will be an insurance requirement when these people purchase their first car, house, and so forth. Demand develops as society grows, and this growth needs to be sustained by insurance. Therefore, we will be supporting this growth in certain segments where the population has needs.</p><h4>How do you see the influx of international insurance players affecting the reinsurance sector in Ecuador, which remains underdeveloped?</h4><p>Ecuador is a unique country in Latin America as the percentage of reinsurance to foreign reinsurance is perhaps one of the highest in Latin America. Around 52% of the risk is reinsured overseas. Companies such as Liberty have been doing the opposite to what local companies have been doing, because we came here bringing our own full capacity and retain the business in the country as much as we can. In certain lines we cede a slight percentage. When I came to Ecuador the percentage that we had in the two local companies we acquired was roughly 50% of retained business and 50% reinsured business. By the end of 2014 we will have around 95% of the business retained in the company. This signals a significant change not only for this company but also for the market. I believe all the insurance companies, particularly the multinationals, are doing likewise. When you retain more business you have to be stricter with the type of business you are writing. You have to have more discipline and enhance your pre-inspection capabilities, as well as having well-aligned and tougher guidelines in order to retain that type of business. Then you need to have good expertise; you need excellent underwriters and data with sound analytics backing those up. We don't want to write business here and then send it abroad to our own, or other international reinsurers.</p><h4>What are your key objectives for Liberty over the next 12 months?</h4><p>Our key objective is to complete the merger. We made great advances in 2013 and believe we are almost at the conclusion. The paramount issue we need to keep working on is enhancing our capabilities locally, which means improving our technical and our technological capabilities. The other issue we are working on is to address deviations in certain business lines in the portfolios of the two Ecuadorean companies we acquired. We are set to restructure in 3Q2014 to accommodate our employees in Quito. Currently, our two locations are inefficient in terms of productivity. Meanwhile, we also need to build our brand. Liberty entered the market in Ecuador in 2012 through our acquisition of two companies, one of which had an excellent name and presence here. Now, it is our objective to build the Liberty brand in this new market.</p><h4>What is your vision for Liberty in Ecuador in the medium term?</h4><p>We foresee having become the premier insurance company in the market. This means the best company in every respect, including in terms of the people who work here, our customers, and the brokers and distributors we work with, and also in terms of the best prices, commissions, services, and support. Company wide, we want to have a unique offering in terms of operational excellence, which will ultimately target much better service in the market for the customers.</p><h4>What makes Ecuador an attractive destination for international investors?</h4><p>I think Ecuador, as a country, offers diversity. Although a small country, geographically it is diverse, the market is growing, and the economic prospects are encouraging. Stability is improving substantially in the market and the consumption habits of the population are changing. The value that Ecuadoreans add to international brands is important. This mix of factors, together with strong players coming to Ecuador from around the globe, is a positive indicator in terms of a place to live and do business. It is also important for Liberty as a group to be here, so we can continue growing our presence in Latin America. We would like to be in more countries and build our brand further by leveraging the strength of the group, in terms of capital strength, size, and reach.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Shell developed in Oman over recent years?</h4><p>A relatively recent development has been the establishment, in 2002, of a Shell office separate from the joint ventures in which we are partners—Petroleum Development Oman (PDO), Oman LNG, and Shell Oman Marketing (SOM). We are a minority shareholder in each of these, with the principal shareholder of the first two being the government of the Sultanate of Oman and the Omani public owning the majority of the third through the Muscat Stock Exchange. We subsequently also became a partner in Occidental's development of the Mukhaizna field. The establishment of a separate Shell office has enabled us better to reach into the wider Royal Dutch Shell group on behalf of our joint ventures in Oman in order to deliver cutting-edge technology and experienced people to the ventures. This ensures that we help the joint ventures deliver projects, enhance their operational excellence, and continuously improve their performance. Other relatively recent Shell in Oman milestones include the 2006 opening of the Shell Technology Oman (STO) office, which is a vehicle for our strategic alliance with PDO on enhanced oil recovery (EOR), the 2010 Technical Support Agreement, which put Shell's technical support under the PDO board governance structure, the Services Agreement signed with Oman LNG the same year, and the 2011 Technology Development Cooperation Agreement between Shell, the government, and PDO. We now have four other strategic technological alliances with PDO, in addition to EOR, covering smart fields, geophysical technologies, materials and corrosion, and fiber optics for wells and reservoir management, with the last two added in 2014.</p><h4>How would you assess the importance of EOR for the Sultanate of Oman? What kind of contribution are you providing to PDO and Oman LNG?</h4><p>According to the government, approximately 18% of Oman's current oil production involves EOR. Part of this is Occidental's development of the Mukhaizna field, which is one of the largest steam flood operations in the world. In PDO the percentage of its oil production using EOR is currently 11%, but PDO expects this to reach 33% by 2023. So EOR is increasingly important for the Sultanate of Oman. The relationship between Shell and PDO on EOR is truly symbiotic in the sense that PDO benefits from Shell's world-class subject matter experts in a range of different EOR disciplines and from Shell's global EOR network, while Shell benefits from PDO's experience implementing novel EOR technologies. This cooperation has placed Oman, PDO, and Shell at the forefront of global EOR innovation. Shell's contribution to PDO and Oman LNG is, by means of technology, people, and a strong focus on asset integrity, safety, and project delivery, helping them to be the extraordinary companies that they are. SOM is one of the leading companies on the local stock exchange, and PDO and Oman LNG are principal engines of the Omani economy. The contribution that these companies make is important to Oman, and we are honored and proud to be partners.</p><h4>Besides the complex geology of the country, what other challenges are you presented with here?</h4><p>The complex subsurface and understanding the nature of PDO's reservoirs is indeed the biggest challenge for us in Oman. Easy oil would be nice to find, and it may still be there to be discovered. As new technologies develop, we may find more resources. The development of seismic technology, for example, has enabled PDO to see small but prolific reservoirs that were just not visible before. In terms of the business environment, meeting the required Omanization rates is sometimes a challenge for us. The nature and the composition of our small office requires experienced expatriates to support the business activities in our joint ventures including R&amp;D, technology transfer, and health and safety. We are part of a business line within Shell that includes countries as far afield as Denmark, Italy, and Kazakhstan, and a number of our staff have regional or global roles. This approach ensures that our people share best practices among these countries, leading to business improvements. One local advantage of having these experts here in Oman, rather than in other countries in the business line, is that they are closer to our important joint ventures here and can provide direct support.</p><h4>SMEs play a critical role in Oman's economy. How are you supporting young entrepreneurs in that respect?</h4><p>We have a program called Intilaaqah, based on the Shell LiveWire program, which was started in the UK in 1982. It aims to give young people the entrepreneurial and innovative skills required to start their own businesses. We have been running Intilaaqah in Oman since 1995. Intilaaqah is a training scheme that takes people through the process of starting their own businesses and teaches participants how to make business plans, apply for funding, and covers a series of other aspects on how to successfully run a business. In 2007, we expanded beyond training by establishing a fund to finance start-ups. In 2011 we enhanced that fund with an additional cash injection, and developed it into the Nomou Fund, which is run by the Shell Foundation and GroFin. Through Intilaaqah we have recently signed MoUs with Future Generations International and Haya Water. We intend to sign an MoU with Al Raffd Fund, too. The first step for an Intilaaqah student is to attend a one-day “Bright Ideas" workshop. We aim for around 2,000 people to go through those every year. Through the workshops we try to get around 500 participants into Intilaaqah's seven-week course, which is called Becoming a Successful Owner/Manager. Everyone has SMEs on their mind. There is a strong focus on promoting SMEs in the Sultanate, and that is absolutely right because the proportion of SMEs here is smaller than in other parts of the world and they can be an engine of future growth. Our youth development programs, FutbolNet and Outward Bound Oman, encourage the sort of personal attributes that might help young entrepreneurs and we run a training for employment program, through which we train about 100-150 young Omanis annually, with guaranteed employment at the end of the training courses. We also train hundreds of Omanis on soft skills like project management, human resources management, communications, work ethics, and customer services.</p><div class="quote">“Right from the outset, we have driven high health and safety standards in all of our joint ventures."</div><h4>How would you assess the development of health, safety, and environmental standards here in the Sultanate?</h4><p>This is something that we, as a company, take a huge amount of pride in. Right from the outset, we have driven high health and safety standards in all of our joint ventures. In 2013, PDO had the best health, safety, security, and environment (HSSE) year ever. Oman LNG has recently recorded 11 million man-hours without any lost time through injury. One only needs to look at the road accident statistics in Oman to see that safety is not what it could be. This is the reason for the considerable effort that we put into our road safety programs. Of all fatalities this year in the oil and gas sector, almost all of them have been road accidents, and this is just tragic. I strongly believe that companies should voluntarily introduce speed limits for trucks that work for them of no more than 80 kilometers per hour. If you get a flat tire driving a heavy truck at speeds greater than this, even if you yourself survive, the result will be a massive weight moving at speed, out of control, that could result in serious damage to the environment and to others. I personally feel that if companies introduced a self-imposed speed limit they could, by the end of the year, definitely have saved someone's life.</p><h4>What changes are Omani companies supposed to make in order to maintain their competitiveness and to contribute to Oman's in-country value (ICV) initiative?</h4><p>Economic theory would suggest that if you can buy things more cheaply locally, you will. So, by its very essence, ICV implies that you are giving preference to something that is more expensive than something else you could buy abroad. If you are a company like Shell, having a global procurement function can save money. What you do not see looking at it through that end of the telescope is that, as a local venture, you may lose in terms of control, time, and influence over the providers of goods and services. While it may not initially be as cheap for, say, PDO to buy something locally as it might be from China, good ICV policies can, over time, ensure that local companies become more internationally price competitive as well as enabling greater local control over the prioritization of repairs and supplies as well as over quality control and product standards. The work that GlassPoint is doing with PDO is a good example of the potential for ICV to bring costs down over time. Everyone is now looking for the next big thing in that space, both in terms of energy conservation and renewables but also in terms of things like water treatment. What is the next really promising technology that we can help generate or foster in Oman? I think that innovation and entrepreneurship should be nurtured in Oman. There are lots of bright young people here and we need to do our utmost to encourage innovation and entrepreneurship in the new generation.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How effective has the Banque du Liban (BDL) stimulus plan, introduced in November 2013, been in creating growth?</h4><p>In 2013, about $1.5 billion was injected into the Lebanese economy by BDL, our central bank. This had, of course, a great impact and allowed growth to reach between 1% and 1.5%, despite all various internal and external complications. It is worth mentioning that this $1.5 billion targeted several sectors; however, it was mainly used to prop up the real estate industry. The real estate sector has great potential for the future. We have low rates if you benchmark them with the region and our surroundings. Lebanon offers a great return on investment at that level. My disappointment was in regard to renewables, where, if I recall, 2.6% of the funds available were invested in the sector, while the rest went into real estate. It was not a problem, but a disappointment because I am a strong believer in renewable energy. In 2014, we will inject a further $800 million. Expectations are good, despite everything. We should reach 2.74% growth if everything is positive until the end of 2014. They expect that, with political stability, Lebanon could achieve 4.5% growth over 2014.</p><h4>What do you feel the priorities should be in the Lebanese economy to reduce the deficit?</h4><p>There are three main priorities today. First of all, we have the Syrian refugees in Lebanon, which is like an open wound in the country, costing us directly almost $1.7 billion per year. The second big wound we have is at the energy level, especially electricity, because when I talk energy, I like to talk about electricity, renewables, and water (ERW), but I will strictly talk about electricity. The cost of electricity per year to Lebanon is $2 billion. If you put together the cost of electricity and the cost of the Syrian crisis, they are draining $3 billion plus from the economy annually. The third problem is waste and corruption. Waste is about how we are losing money for nothing. If we just manage these three points, we can manage the entire Lebanese economy in just one year's time. However, we need support on all three levels. On the first level, we have some commitment on the international level, and we should have a clear plan for the Syrian refugees. On the second point, we should have a clear plan on how to exit from the electricity problem that we have, especially by implementing the public-private partnership (PPP) approach. On the third point, the Lebanese government should do something specifically about the ports and airports, so as to end the waste of money on customs. In essence, we need better customs management. The third one is the easiest, and we should achieve it in a matter of weeks. On the second point, in July we had a meeting with the privatization council that is tackling the problem of PPP. We reached several main decisions to achieve better management over this area. This includes electricity, telecommunications, and water, but the main focus would be electricity in the first step. If you can arrange this sector, you can use the funds we are losing on that level for investments, for example on railroads.</p><div class="quote">“In 2013, about $1.5 billion was injected into the Lebanese economy by BDL, our central bank."</div><h4>What would you like to see as the next concrete step in the electricity and telecommunication sectors?</h4><p>The main next step would be to tackle the legal aspect, because we don't have anything on that level. If we can tackle the legal aspect first, we can achieve almost 50% of the road map to reach this, mainly on the electricity front. For telecommunications, we still have a sort of duopoly in Lebanon. Also during the council of ministers meeting, we were discussing how to open this sector up to a third-party operator owned by the government, Liban Telecom, and how to implement this to achieve better services and prices, and to reduce the monopoly element in the sector. This is how we can liberate both electricity and telecoms through PPPs. It should be a similar process for both.</p><h4>What have been the most important factors that prevented the country from going into recession?</h4><p>Recently, there was a report on CNN based on several main consultancy approaches to Lebanon. These companies are saying that today Beirut is among one of the 12 best cities to invest in. This means that we have great potential in Lebanon. If the foreigners are looking at Lebanon like that, then how should we look at our own country? I am saying that because we tend to think pessimistically before optimistically in this country. These companies were saying that Lebanon has many potential promising sectors, such as real estate, education, and health. The second important point I wanted to mention was that between 2010 and 2013, we have had an average GDP growth rate of 1.7%, despite everything, whereas Europe has recorded around -0.6% over the same period. The main points that are allowing this are three. First of all, the private sector with all its components, then the financial sector. Today, total assets under management (AUM) in Lebanon recorded a 7.1% increase over 2014. In terms of deposits we have seen a 6.2% increase, and a 7.1% increase in loans. The financial sector is doing well. The third point, which is the most important, is in regard to expatriates and immigrants. The immigrants segment is not well-used or implemented in Lebanon currently. We can do more on that level. On the expatriate level, since it is an individual approach, they are doing fine. They come in for a short time, and go back, or at least send money back to their families. The immigrants leave and don't come back; however, they can still have interaction with the country. Today, we are trying to implement something that nobody else is doing in Lebanon. It is similar to a form of economic diplomacy, using our embassies as a point of sale. This is not just for expatriates, but for other markets as well. If we look into exactly what we need from each country and what each country needs from us, then this intermediary can be the embassy.</p><h4>How significant will the proposals by the European Investment Bank (EIB) to invest ‚¬164 million be to support the local banking sector?</h4><p>The main point to reach on that level is that it is not only that investment. Other investments in Lebanon are also important. In the second pillar we mentioned, the private sector, you have one important segment that we are trying to develop to help and support, which is the SME segment. I imagine the main subject and target of this foreign investment on that level is not just about what the EU is doing, because we also have many funds helping on that level. The Ministry is preparing a national charter for SMEs to achieve this goal.</p><h4>What do you think is the most significant infrastructure that needs to be developed in the oil and gas sector here?</h4><p>First of all, the whole network. You need tanks and pipelines, for example. We should also work on human resources. According to the law, you need 80% of your staff to be Lebanese. In oil, not many people have the expertise for that, meaning there are only a few Lebanese workers. From where will we import the human power and knowledge? During those six or seven years before we have extraction commence, we should launch a major training program on a national level, especially at universities, for oil management. What is necessary is that all the required infrastructure and HR, which is the main objective, are in place before extraction starts.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is African Barrick Gold (ABG) working to increase the level of local content?</h4><p>When I joined we had an office in Johannesburg, with a staff of over 200 people. We are relocating all but 25 to Dar es Salaam to new premises. Those roles have been given to Tanzanians. Even at our mines we are reducing the number of expatriates, from over 500 to about 300 over the past few months, and that number will continue decline.</p><h4>How has your experience in Tanzania helped you in your expansion plans for other countries in the region?</h4><p>ABG is the largest private employer in the country and the largest power contributor in the country. We are also the largest taxpayer. We have been here now for nearly 15 years and were one of the first companies to establish a foothold here when the mining industry was opened to private enterprise. We have done well out of it, and so has Tanzania as a result of our presence. Tanzania will always be our hub, although we do have an active exploration program in Kenya. One day that may become a second operating country if it develops into a mine. We are looking at opportunities in West Africa as well. We hope to be a significant player on the African continent, with Tanzania being the center of gravity.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on ABG's plans regarding exploration?</h4><p>Most of our opportunities in Tanzania are immediately around our three mines. We did have a very large land bank in Tanzania. We have now relinquished about 80% of that so that it can pass on to the next generation of miners. There are several junior explorers that have entered the country to start reworking that ground. That in itself creates a new economy in mining and exploration.</p><div class="quote">“ABG is the largest private employer in the country and the largest power contributor in the country."</div><h4>How would you assess the current regulatory framework for the mining sector in Tanzania?</h4><p>Foreign investors like us crave fiscal stability. A lot of our time is spent talking to senior government figures on why our original mining development agreements should be honored. They have largely been honored, which has been welcome. When you think about the challenges we face in Tanzania, the top three in business terms are really VAT refunds, power, and law and order.  Having said that, we are making true progress on the VAT refunds issue. At one stage we had over $100 million outstanding, but that number continues to decline significantly. We are always talking to the government about how we can manage that number. So that has been a good outcome for us. The second major impact on our business is the unreliability of power. We are the largest power consumer in the country, but for our operations we have had to install backup power facilities at each of our three mines so that when the TANESCO supply is interrupted we can continue to run the mines without production loss. Ultimately, we would prefer to rely solely on TANESCO power, but that has not always been possible. That is an issue that we continue to work with TANESCO on, and its management has been responsive in recent times. There is a solution. but it is not a quick one. That is another issue that will resolve itself over the next two or three years, particularly with all the new power projects coming into the country. At some stage we will benefit from the new gas projects. Then possibly, the third major issue in terms of impact on our business is law and order. We do suffer from illegal mining within our mining boundaries at North Mara, which is well documented. We continue to work with the government to try to get on top of that challenge. The response is not a security response; it is a community and a governmental response.</p><h4>What brownfield projects are you focusing on in the near term?</h4><p>The company has been losing money for some time, but we are happy to acknowledge that we are starting to make money today even with the prevailing low gold prices. We have dropped our cost base by more than one-third over the last 12 months. The first focus for us is to fix the three mines. The second stage is to look at how can improve the production coming out of them and to look at other resources we can mine at each of those three locations. We are doing quite a bit of drilling in and around the mines and deeper below the mines. At North Mara, for instance, we think we will be going underground for the first time next year from operating an open mine. And Bulyanhulu is a world-class deposit with nearly 20 million ounces running at nearly 10 grams per ton. Based upon today's numbers that will suffice for another 30 or 40 years. With the additional drilling we are doing on reef one and reef two we expect that that will be 50 years plus, so that is a fantastic asset. I am glad it is ours and not someone else's.</p><h4>What are your targets for 2015?</h4><p>Last year we produced 640,000 ounces. In 2014 we are aiming for between 640,000 and 690,000 ounces. Next year will be significantly higher than that, mainly driven by the improvement at Bulyanhulu. We are aiming to almost double the overall production level from that underground mine. That will be a significant achievement. I look forward to registering an annualized run rate of 350,000 ounces at Bulyanhulu by the end of 2015.</p><h4>The Ministry of Mining has a vision of the mining sector accounting for 10% of GDP in Tanzania. When and how can this be achieved?</h4><p>Geologically, there is the potential to reach those kinds of targets. I think last year the figure was close to 4% of GDP, and we provided the lion's share of that 4%. There is some growth within our business by itself, but there is definitely potential for others to come in and help to grow the industry in Tanzania. Metal prices will determine just how quickly that increase occurs. The industry has been through an interesting phase. Metal prices have come off significantly after the China boom. China is still doing extremely well for itself, but prices have come off a lot in the last few years. Quite a few managers in this industry have not been exposed to the conditions that exist today. I think there are some real opportunities for companies like ours to differentiate themselves in the industry. I would certainly like to see ABG become the preferred mining company in Africa. I would like us to approach the industry in quite a different manner in terms of how we market ourselves, our relations with the government and the community, and how we develop our people. I am quite serious about changing that whole game in the industry, because the industry has such a bad reputation from the past. It is not too difficult to change that in my opinion. We would like to change the game. We want to make be profitable, but having said that we also want to take a leadership role in how the industry relates to Africa.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Exiplast is celebrating 40 years. How has the company evolved over these past four decades?</h4><p>Exiplast is a family-owned business, and was initially a very small venture that my grandfather started. At that time, Bogotá was being constructed with low-density housing, and my grandfather had a small metal business in which he constructed metal doors and metal structures for roofs. Over time, he identified a need for new materials to be used, as many people began to use glass to cover garages and auxiliary structures. With the help of my father, they began to utilize fiberglass and plastics, going door to door to take the measurements of each space to provide tailor-made pieces. My grandfather's legacy was developed by my father, who made it more industrial. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the depression in the construction sector made business difficult, so we looked at different areas and started working in the transportation business. Fortunately, the attitude of the Colombian entrepreneur is one of a willingness to take risks and chances, so we have been successful in introducing new concepts and solutions.</p><h4>Exiplast has diversified over the years. What sectors do you believe have the most potential for growth?</h4><p>Oil and gas and water treatment have great potential for growth. Issues regarding reduced water supplies mean that the water infrastructure needs to be redeveloped, and this presents opportunities for the use of fiberglass or composites, because water loss is related to corrosion. We conducted a small market research study and identified some opportunities in this area. Our business is spread across construction, which is how the company started, and we have business lines in transportation, oil and gas, and water treatment.</p><h4>What are your expectations for Exiplast's new joint venture?</h4><p>We used to represent Danpalon, a manufacturer of polycarbonate sheets from Israel, but in 2013 we entered into a joint venture with it and opened a new business for Colombia and the region. The new business is going to be working in Colombia, Panama, Ecuador, and Venezuela. It will manufacture polycarbonate sheets for sustainable architectural purposes, mostly roofs and facades. We have been its representative in Colombia for the past 18 years, and as the company is in an expansionary phase, it was willing to expand its operations here, too. It has a development pipeline of new products, which is interesting, and so our objective here is to push these new products, which is mostly focused on sustainable systems for facades. This year has been great not only for the new company, but for Exiplast, because our numbers are growing at a double-digit rate. We came from a low rate of growth in 2012 and 2013, and in 2014 have a lot of expectations due to high international interest showed by international investors in our country and also because of the economic stability the country is demonstrating year by year.</p><div class="quote">“Fortunately, the attitude of the Colombian entrepreneur is one of a willingness to take risks and chances."</div><h4>What is Exiplast's growth focus?</h4><p>Our focus is based on innovation and our strategy is to start a close dialogue with our customers and begin identifying what they are going to be doing inside of their projects. With this information we come up with custom-made solutions, looking to improve their key performance indicators (KPIs) and ensuring a return on investment (ROI) that matches expectations.</p><h4>What factors are making Colombia an attractive destination for foreign investment, particularly in the construction sector?</h4><p>Colombia's macro economic numbers and government policies are working. The country is viewed through a different perspective, particularly for this region, and we are receiving many international investors with new projects because the new free trade agreements (FTAs) allow them to manufacture in Colombia and export to the region. Our geographical location is beneficial if you want to export to Central America, South America, or even North America. This situation makes the free trade zones (FTZs) a very interesting project developing market.</p><h4>Exiplast's goal is to become a world-class organization by 2020. How are you planning to achieve this?</h4><p>We are taking this one step at a time. We are first considering our human resources potential, as we understand that people are the most important capital in the company, and so we have a very structured, professional career development process for the people who work in our company in order to develop their competency. We are also accompanying that with a transformational cultural program, which focuses on principles and values. This is a program in which everyone in the company gathers around a round table in groups of eight to 10 people, and has an hour-long to talk about principles and values. We feel we also need to develop and structure our peoples character and for them to take that home and into their community. In order to compete as a world-class organization, we are also planning our investments regarding new technologies. We have strong competitors in the region, and the strategy that has helped us counter their attack into Colombia is our unique products; the legacy that my grandfather left for our company.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In your opinion, what is the current state of development in the construction and real estate industry in Colombia?</h4><p>Thanks to the growth trends the country enjoys, the sector foresees a similar expansion in the next few years as it experienced in the last three to five years. We could divide the main driving forces in the sector into two: the housing segment and the public infrastructure segment. I think the four power generation projects will capitalize the growth of the sector in the near future, especially within the framework of the free trade agreements (FTAs) signed with the US and South Korea, for example. Regarding the real estate segment, we have recently seen fluctuations that are normal in the sector, and I expect these growth trends to continue for quite some time. There is still great potential for development in the entire country—since we are located on the coast, there is great potential in the second house market. As the purchasing power of the society continues growing, I expect this particular segment will also expand in the near future.</p><h4>What is the potential for Santa Marta to become a top regional destination within the health tourism sector?</h4><p>The climate and geographic conditions of Santa Marta make this city the best destination for people seeking treatment and medical procedures. From a health point of view, Santa Marta is the best place to live. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that the reputation of the city in health tourism is growing very quickly.</p><div class="quote">“I do not even think that there is speculation in the real estate market in Santa Marta."</div><h4>What type of profitability can real estate investors find in Santa Marta?</h4><p>This is something very subjective; it depends upon the type of housing and the segment in which this is located. We can talk of an average 5% to 10% profitability, which is still low. However, we have developed projects in the second housing segment with profitability levels, even before construction, of around 22%.</p><h4>What would you say to those who contend that there is a real estate bubble in Santa Marta?</h4><p>First of all, in order for a real estate bubble to exist, the value of the assets has to be akin to the debt, which it is not actually happening. Buyer's debt is around 55% of the value of the property. Santa Marta still enjoys very high revaluation levels. I do not even think that there is speculation in the real estate market in Santa Marta.</p><h4>What are the challenges facing Santa Marta with the hosting in 2017 of the Bolivarian Games, which predict the arrival of over 5,000 people?</h4><p>Hosting this type of international sporting event requires either having or building a first-class sports infrastructure. We see this as the perfect opportunity to better position Santa Marta at the international level, as happened with Barcelona and Beijing after the Olympic Games. It will help consolidate Santa Marta as a top tourism destination. Therefore, there are many opportunities and challenges.</p><h4>How important are the Two Towers and Portovela projects for the city, and what will those offer to Santa Marta?</h4><p>We have been pioneers in terms of design in the entire country, because we brought to Colombia, as a partner, one of the most recognized architecture companies in the world. We are leaders in terms of design. Also, we have the best teams of specialists. The locations of these two projects are unbeatable; they are located in the most dynamic areas of the city, by the sea.</p><h4>In terms of social responsibility, what are some of the main actions Constructora Jimenez has implemented?</h4><p>We have developed a couple of projects to help orphaned children in the city, and at the moment we are about to close an agreement with a consultancy company specializing in providing technical assistance in terms of corporate social responsibility (CSR), as we want to take our actions to the next level. Also, I would like to say that we are highly committed to providing the local population with labor opportunities; at the moment, 80% of our staff are from the local region. Additionally, we offer regular and continued training courses; we also provide them with financial support in order for them to further specialize their careers or take particular courses they are interested in. Finally, we have also developed a scholarship program on four occasions to support local students.</p><h4>In your opinion, how should Santa Marta's tourism potential be met?</h4><p>Santa Marta has great potential in the tourism sphere, but at the same time it is surrounded by natural spaces that are legally protected, meaning that there are no construction options around these areas. I think we need to increase cooperation between local and national authorities, developing a long-term strategy for the city to fulfill its potential. For example, I think some lands should be given to develop certain tourism infrastructure projects, as well as other commercial projects. This applies to areas like Tayrona. At the same time, there are other areas in the city that in the last few years have consolidated their potential.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you rate the current healthcare system in Oman?</h4><p>The Sultanate of Oman has made remarkable achievements in health developments over the past four decades. These health achievements have been praised by a number of international organizations. The UN Children's Fund (UNICEF), in its Progress of Nations 1993 report, ranked Oman first in the Middle East and North Africa Region (MENA) and second globally as regards to the percentage reduction of the under-five mortality rate. The same report also ranked Oman first in the MENA region as regards measles immunization coverage. Oman was among the 12 developing countries that achieved the 2000 year target, set by the World Summit for Children 1990, of at least 90% childhood immunization coverage, long before the target date. The Human Development Report 1997 of the UNDP stated that “Beginning in 1970, Oman undertook a comprehensive program of human development, achieving some of the most rapid advances ever recorded. Life expectancy has increased by 30 years; from 40 years in 1970 to 70 years in 1994. Infant mortality was reduced from more than 200 per 1,000 live births in 1960 to less than 30 in 1994." This report considered Oman as a global pace-setter for human development, especially in the areas of health and education. A study commissioned by the government of Oman, UNICEF, and the World Health Organization (WHO) on health achievements in Oman reported that Oman's decline in childhood mortality is one of the fastest recorded in the world. The health system in Oman is judged to respond to peoples' needs, whether health or non-health. The Oman World Health Survey, conducted in 2008, showed that about three-quarters of the surveyed people needed some sort of healthcare during the three years preceding the survey, and that 98.4% received the care they needed; only 1.6% did not receive care. The survey also showed that the health system was responsive to their overall non-health needs, with an average score of about 76% for inpatient services and slightly more than 77% for outpatient services. The results clearly show that the people are satisfied with how healthcare providers treat them as well as with the quality of health service amenities.</p><h4>How is the Ministry working to develop healthcare infrastructure in the country?</h4><p>Healthcare infrastructure has showed remarkable growth since the early days in 1970. From only two small hospitals with only 12 beds and 19 clinics distributed across the country in 1970, today, after 43 years by the end of 2013, Oman had a total of 66 hospitals; 49 run by Ministry of Health, five by other public healthcare providers, and 12 by the private sector, with a total of 6,178 hospital beds. There is now one hospital bed to serve about 624 members of the population, compared with about 50,000 in the early 1970s. The Ministry of Health is now running 195 health centers, all providing high-quality primary healthcare. In addition, there are 50 clinics owned by other public healthcare providers and 1,026 private clinics providing basic medical care. There are also incentives for the private sector.</p><h4>What emphasis are you placing on finding well-educated local medical professionals?</h4><p>Medical education commenced in Oman in 1986 with the establishment of the College of Medicine and Health Sciences at Sultan Qaboos University (SQU) in Muscat. Prior to that, Omani students had to travel abroad in order to pursue medical degrees. The College of Medicine and Health Sciences at SQU enrolled its first batch of 45 students for the MD program in 1986, and graduated a total of 1,676 of medical graduates between 1993 and 2012. The MD degree from SQU is accredited by the General Medical Council of the UK. There are a total of 658 students studying specialties related to healthcare abroad. SQU has also contributed to the graduation of a number of paramedical personnel. In addition to Oman Medical College (OMC), another private university, the University of Nizwa (UON) was established in 2004/2005 and offers undergraduate programs for pharmacy and nursing. These educational institutes have graduated a total of 1,940 physicians, 47 dentists, 407 pharmacists, 342 nurses, and 94 medical laboratory specialists. The expected future challenges and the epidemiological profile with a predominance of non-communicable diseases require highly skilled healthcare providers, and there are plans to convert Ministry of Health educational institutes into colleges. The Health Vision 2050 has clearly laid down a vision to promote the education of health professionals.</p><div class="quote">“The success in developing tertiary services will make Oman a hub for medical tourism."</div><h4>What is the importance of the International Medical Center for the Sultanate of Oman? How would you assess the potential of Oman to become a hub for medical tourism?</h4><p>The current existing tertiary-care hospitals are congested and cannot accommodate the expansion of existing sub-specialties or the addition of new super-specialties and services. The congestion seen in tertiary-care services and lack of sub-specialties had forced numbers of patients to seek tertiary care outside the country, partly at the cost of the government and for others as an out-of-pocket expense. The new super-specialty procedures require high-tech ancillary services, more operation theater time, and more intensive infection control procedures. Alterations and/or upgrading of the existing tertiary-care services would not be ideal in terms of logistics and technological requirements. The construction of fresh, state-of-the-art tertiary care facilities should thus be considered for the future development of tertiary-care services. The analysis of the expected admission rates to tertiary care, population growth, and disease profile suggest the construction of 2,000 beds for different specialties. Comprehensive care requires multi-disciplinary inputs suggesting that the construction of proposed tertiary beds should be in the same campus, as in a medical city. Having such services in one place would also optimize the utilization of staff and technology. In the coming years, we aim to achieve world-class tertiary care in hospitals of excellence. This would reduce health expenditures made by patients seeking care outside the country and would provide care to patients near their homes and within their families. Ensuring the availability of tertiary care to patients close to their families would not only have financial, but also social implications. Attempting to make curative services accessible to the people of Oman, efforts need to be made to provide the best possible diagnostic, therapeutic, and rehabilitative services and to introduce certain, super-specialty services that are not available in the country, which would reduce the number of those seeking medical care abroad. The success in developing tertiary services will make Oman a hub for medical tourism.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does the healthy growth of local construction sector mean for Colombia's economy at large?</h4><p>I think the boom the sector is enjoying is the direct result of the boost the current government has given to the construction sector in recent years. Government policies have contributed to providing lower income citizens with housing units. I think that there have never been so many favorable tools for people to access the housing market with, such as low interest rates, the result of which is the sector's current buoyancy.</p><h4>What role do public-private partnerships (PPPs) play in the sector?</h4><p>PPPs are a great tool to promote the development of infrastructure projects, and boost activity in this segment, rendering Colombia still more competitive within the framework of the several free trade agreements (FTAs) it has recently signed. We have also seen a growing trend lately to implement PPPs within the housing segment to boost the development of such projects in municipalities across Colombia's regions.</p><div class="quote">“PPPs are a great tool to promote the development of infrastructure projects."</div><h4>In your opinion, what kind of housing project does Cali require the most at the moment?</h4><p>Cali and its neighboring municipalities have a characteristic demand trend. Over the past few years, Cali and its environs have received people from other regions, which has increased the demand for low-cost housing units. Therefore, average demand for such properties is higher in Cali and neighboring towns than elsewhere in the country. In other words, 33% of the housing transactions in Cali and neighboring municipalities are for these low-cost types of properties. Since demand is still more than relevant in this segment, we foresee an increase in demand in the market for properties within strata 3, 2, and 1. I think the future of the construction and real estate sector in Cali is quite bright and promising.</p><h4>Since the company started operating in the agribusiness industry and later on shifted to the construction sector, becoming one of the most dynamic companies in the country, how has Constructora Meléndez evolved over the last few years?</h4><p>Innovation and creativity have always been two of the main characteristics of our company. Despite having our origins in agribusiness, the growth of the city and the region, along with the vision of the future our founders had, drove us to become what we are today; one of the most dynamic construction companies in Colombia. The company was initially conceived as Sociedad Garcés Giraldo Hermanos, which engaged in the agricultural business. Also, it had large tracts of land where it cultivated sugar cane, among other staples. The Garcés Giraldo family has always been very close to the development of Cali and the region, and that's why they donated 1 million sqm for the development of Universidad del Valle. After putting an end to its agribusiness activity, the Garcés Giraldo family saw a very interesting opportunity within the construction sector, developing a portion of its land. That was the beginning of what today is Constructora Meléndez and, ever since, it has been a major player in the local industry, leaving a clear footprint in the urban development of Cali and the region. In fact, the commitment of the family to Cali and the region continued throughout the years with the donation of some more land, the construction of key projects, and their involvement in other large projects that have resulted in essential milestones for the development of the region. Constructora Meléndez has built shopping malls, housing properties, industrial complexes, and more.</p><h4>What challenges have you encountered down the years?</h4><p>The construction sector is a rather cyclical one, and our company, like others, has not been oblivious to the crises blighting the sector over the past two decades. The industry suffered from one of the worst crises between 1995 and 1999, a period that saw many companies go bankrupt. Despite its financial difficulties, our company managed to stay afloat thanks to the unconditional and valuable support of its shareholders, and we managed to reverse the situation, positioning the company among the leading companies in the sector in Colombia today. The crisis of the late 1990s taught many companies and authorities to be more cautious when measuring risk. For example, the country adopted the pre-sales model in the industry through real estate trustees, increasing the feeling of security among buyers and making sure constructors appropriately use the money they receive from buyers' down payments. Financial institutions also became more prudent when granting mortgages. The financial and construction sectors are therefore stronger thanks to the lessons learned from the crisis. We currently have great interest in expanding business activities to cities and towns around the so-called “Coffee Production Belt" of Armenia, Manizales, and Pereira, and also in Bogotá.</p><h4>How was 2013 for Constructora Meléndez?</h4><p>We closed the year with a property sales value of around $90 million, with $70 million from housing properties and $20 million from selling corporate solutions. These are the two main segments in which we concentrate our activity today. These were impressive results thanks to the consolidation of projects we launched into the market between 2011 and 2012. The housing properties we sold were praised for their high-quality designs and unbeatable surroundings. Our main goal is to contribute to the development of the city and its communities through several construction projects. Such ambition proves, once more, our commitment toward the development of the city and the region.</p><h4>What are some of the key projects the company has developed over the years?</h4><p>Ciudad Meléndez is a very ambitious project spread over 100 hectares, where we aim at constructing between 10,000 to 12,000 housing units. We also envisage the development of commercial, cultural, and educational spaces, providing our clients with comprehensive services. We can also highlight the Cinco Soles project, set to be developed on an area of around 20 hectares, including some 500 residential housing units.</p><h4>How does the construction and real estate sector work toward a further professionalization of its human work force?</h4><p>The sector is among the largest employers in the country, and fortunately we have changed old stereotypes about employing an unqualified work force. At the same time, labor laws and regulations have also helped to formalize jobs and boost employability levels in the sector. Our company offers stability and regular training tools to its employees.</p><h4>What role can companies like Constructora Meléndez play in the reintegration of people within a post-conflict scenario in Colombia?</h4><p>I think many companies in Colombia, even smaller than ours and engaging in other sectors, need to take a step forward in such processes and contribute to the reduction of violence in the country. We all need to work together to reinsert people and support this process, and our company is willing to take an active role in it.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Ecuador's growth in recent years has mainly been funded by public investment. What is the government's strategy to ensure that this translates into sustainable development?</h4><p>The goal of our government is to promote a change in how the country produces goods and services. We want to change the country from being a mainly primary goods producer to one that has a significant industrial and services sector. In 2013, Ecuador's economy grew by 4.5%, and over the past four years has recorded average growth rates of 5.2%. This is quite stable, not just for Latin America, but globally. But more importantly, the manufacturing sector and the non-oil economy grew considerably. The non-oil sector has grown by 5.8% since the world economic crisis of 2010. Our aim is to transform Ecuador into a non-oil and knowledge-based economy, although it remains in need of generating foreign exchange. These foreign exchange revenues are being used to promote a different growth and development pattern. Public investment has to underpin a basic infrastructure that allows the non-oil industries to shift their costs to become more profitable. This has been happening heavily over the past five or six years. This is because, from a cost structure perspective, it would not be possible to bring about the changes needed solely through private initiatives. The government must provide the infrastructure, roads, electricity, education, healthcare, and higher education. These are all crucial to changing the relative costs of industry over time. Today, all non-oil sectors are growing faster than in the past, in a highly stable economy. Ecuador has solid growth, low inflation and unemployment, stable interest rates, and increasing human talent, all conducive to private sector investment. We do have a current account deficit, since we are investing and importing raw materials and capital goods to support production and these investments, but the current account deficit is still only 1.3% of GDP, which is quite manageable. Our financial system is also stable. We have the highest liquidity rates in our history since becoming a dollarized economy, having increased from 29% in 2009 to 37% in 2013.</p><h4>Considering what we have seen over the past few years among southern EU countries, do you have concerns that you are using a currency over which you have no control, while at the same time engaging in high levels of public investment?</h4><p>This concern explains why we place great importance on stability and responsibility, and accounting for every dollar. As we lack a national currency, each US dollar that goes out means less money to fund Ecuadorean growth, while each US dollar that comes into the country promotes growth, spurring greater investment opportunities and aiding the financial system in general. Three years ago new policies allowed us to control the volume of money in the economy, helping to attract money to Ecuador. In the past it was common for bankers and citizens to save money abroad. Our new policies make it more attractive to keep their money here. This has increased liquidity in the economy, which encourages further investment. Credit policies are also important, be it via the private or public banking sector. Total credit increased from 20.3% of GDP to 28%. In nominal amounts, credit growth has been at 109% over the past five years, while private credit rates have grown by 92%, and the public banking figures are at 356%. We have followed a deliberate policy of increasing credit to keep the country going and the economy running smoothly. In 2013, FDI accounted for 0.8% of GDP, or $702 million, which many consider as low, although FDI in Ecuador is a net provider of foreign exchange, and those rates are still the highest Ecuador has seen in the past five years.</p><div class="quote">“The goal of our government is to promote a change in how the country produces goods and services."</div><h4>The BCE is a signatory of the Maya Declaration for Financial Inclusion. How are you incorporating efforts to promote financial inclusion in BCE policies?</h4><p>We are changing the structure of our means of payment system. In Ecuador, checks used to be important, but we are now shifting to electronic payment systems. That is crucially important because it enables you to increase the amount of money in circulation by promoting faster transactions in the economy. We have also included the cooperative sector in the traditional means of payment system, and their share in the system has increased by 18%, which is an important development.</p><h4>What are your key priorities for the BCE over the coming years?</h4><p>Providing enough liquidity for the economy and making sure it stays stable with an adequate growth rate for credit, and making sure loans are repaid are all key priorities for us. We also have to be careful about spending quality, as we are obviously trying to make sure we have a net increase in the amount of money coming in.</p><h4>As Ecuador prepares to reenter the international bond markets, is there a concern that investors will still remember the Ecuadorean default in 2009?</h4><p>We know that Ecuador does not have a good reputation. What we have said in our meetings with the major financial institutions is that figures show that Ecuador has been changing over the past seven or eight years. Investors must realize that the economy is now stable. They see that we are investing in health, education, development, and infrastructure. They see that Ecuador is more transparent than ever before. Every international financial organization has improved our risk rating, and this is allowing us to change the perception of Ecuador abroad.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What would you say are your core business services?</h4><p>Courteville Business Solutions (CBS) offers services aimed at improving process efficiencies for the private and public sectors. This provides us with opportunities to look at gaps and overlaps in how things are done. We can then decide whether to apply a system to walk a firm through the development of a web or application processing system. We choose to go with mobile web or application services to help companies deliver their products and services to the satisfaction of all stakeholders. AutoReg is our flagship tool, while the other new one is Egole Shopping, an online shopping site that I am proud to say is the only profitable e-commerce site in the whole of West Africa. There are over 250 merchants on Egole Shopping that have been provided with virtual office suites and shops through which they can sell their goods. That is what we do. We help the buyers get onto the site, and we help companies to sell their products. However, you cannot always successfully copy and paste a model that apparently works well in the West into the Nigerian Market. You have to take culture into consideration, and that is what we have done with Egole. That is one very clear reason as to why Egole Shopping has been successful. Egole Shopping is a platform that allows over 10,000 users, on a daily basis, to visit the site and browse for goods. It also allows the users of the site, governments, merchants, and independent outlets to get together. All this combined, the model works to put Egole Shopping at the center of Courteville's intention to diversify its business portfolio. AutoReg works with motor vehicle documentation, which is up to government to approve or not. As a strategy, we decided not to rely entirely on that because things may change. We decided that we wanted to do something that applies directly to the private sector, such that, if someone decides to sell something, they can do so using their laptop. That is Egole Shopping's mission.</p><h4>What are the tools Courteville is offering to different industries?</h4><p>We have a relationship with the Nigerian Insurance Association, whereby we designed, developed, and manage the entire database management system for insurance policy issuance on motor vehicles across the whole of Nigeria on behalf of the Association. And now, we are in the very process of adding marine insurance policy documentation to that. Thanks to practices like this, every single motor vehicle is now authentically insured in Nigeria. I desire a model like this not only for Courteville, but also for the insurance industry as a whole. It would help the way the general tariff is structured in Nigeria. It would also help insurance companies in confirming when the customer signs a policy with them. It allows the regulators of the industry to get a clearer sense of the kind of business that is happening in the industry, and this has been a major issue in the past. We also work with the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) by providing a system that has allowed it to reduce the processing period for the approval of certification processes of all manufactured products or imported/exported goods from what used to be, say nine months to a year, down to a week. That is what we do; we provide efficiency and improvement to your system. We also have solutions in the area of education named PSEAMS, a system that allow parents to monitor their children remotely from wherever they are through active live monitoring, as well as ones that allow students to attend school remotely. Another solution we have is PRM, which helps in the documentation of properties and the collection of taxes for waste management.</p><div class="quote">“We have about 200 staff within the company, but we indirectly employ about 10,000 people across Nigeria."</div><h4>What are the benefits of working in a country like Nigeria on projects such as this?</h4><p>Africa has a population of about a billion people, while Nigeria has a population of some 170 million. That is 17% of the population of the continent. And we realized that there is a huge gap between the supply of education and demand. The demand is huge and the number of institutions is not sufficient to accommodate the demand. We also realized that the direction of the curriculum is much more toward the academic sciences. The next frontier is to educate the youth and this caused the introduction of RELAY, an online educational platform and a vocational-inclined online education program created in collaboration with Ravensbourne, a UK university that has famous alumni like designer Stella McCartney, David Bowie, and many more. We are starting in five main areas: fashion pattern cutting, fashion promotion, website design and content management, interior design, and film-editing and post-production. We are able to achieve the same kind of quality in online education, but very cheaply at around £200 for one module. That is the first of its kind anywhere in this part of the world. Everything about our model is locally designed and locally implemented in Nigeria; we design solutions to match and to identify with what is necessary to overcome challenges in Nigeria. For you to be successful, particularly in Nigeria, you have to be 10 times better than what is used in Europe, the US, and Asia. We are not India yet, but we can be the India of Africa to start with. We believe that in the next five years and, through our medium-term strategy plan, supplying them with services, our next focus cuts across West Africa, Europe, and the Caribbean. As an ISO-certified company, we have been able to deliver services matching international standards. We have about 200 staff within the company, but we indirectly employ about 10,000 people across Nigeria.</p><h4>Is the Nigerian market sophisticated enough to absorb all these services at once?</h4><p>There is always a curve. The curve is regular for every single innovation. In order to be innovative, when you introduce something, you have stick with it. Of course, this will not guarantee that Nigerians will recognize and want what is good for them. If the technology is not coming from India, the US, or the UK, it is difficult for them to trust it. All the government has to do is to trust us.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What milestones has the company achieved in Panama since you became General Manager?</h4><p>Microsoft's presence in Panama spans over more than 15 years. We are one of the oldest IT companies working here directly from its own office. While other IT providers tend to work exclusively through their partners, we work directly with over 1,000 small companies that resell our products and services. I also have responsibility for liaising with the government. We work with the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Commerce and Industries in assisting around 3,000 small companies to develop and grow faster, driven by technology. Three years ago Steve Ballmer, our former CEO, signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with President Ricardo Martinelli, outlining different areas for us to work on. Education, SMEs, and intellectual property rights were areas in which we would work and we also requested President Martinelli's contribution. Panama is not a country with a strong history of intellectual property rights enforcement, and it formerly had a significant piracy rate of over 70%. Part of that piracy was impacting us heavily in terms of revenue, and particularly affected SMEs in terms of security and vulnerabilities. Although our main operation is dedicated almost exclusively to Panama, our staff also does work in several other countries in the region, because it is convenient for our people to travel from here to wherever they are needed.</p><h4>In 2013, Microsoft began an initiative called CityNext to bring governmental services closer to citizens. How has this project developed?</h4><p>Through this project we seek to support the government in different areas such as traffic, security, and health. We have experience in these areas having already provided successful solutions in many countries around the world, which we want to share with the public sector. The Panamanian government is dedicated to improving the urban landscape and reducing traffic to offer citizens a better quality of life. Naturally enough, technology has a key role in this process.</p><h4>The Inter-American Development Bank, in partnership with Microsoft, is supporting SMEs in the local tourism sector through the Microsoft Innovation Center for Tourism. What was the strategy behind this initiative?</h4><p>That initiative was also included in the MoU we signed with President Martinelli. In collaboration with the government, we designed, defined, and created application solutions for tourism. This demands financing and other resources, and will require a number of years before the effects become clear, and is therefore a worthy long-term commitment. We want not only to work in tourism, but also in other sectors. We have begun in tourism, however, because it contributes significantly to GDP.</p><div class="quote">“Over the past three years, we have increased our revenues significantly."</div><h4>What is the importance of social responsibility for Microsoft in Panama?</h4><p>Social responsibility is an important element of Microsoft's ethos, to which each staff member is required to dedicate part of their time. We are carrying out initiatives with prominent families, as well as with the government. Most recently we have also provided software to schools, at an investment of close to $150,000. In partnership with the Ministry of Education, we provide students with a reduced-functionality, heavy-duty laptop called the Balboa Classmate. It has Microsoft Windows and Office. The software was given free and is now used by more than 150,000 students. We have also introduced students to the Windows 8 touchscreen and cloud solutions and are close to providing 100% cloud solutions and Office 365 to university students. We offer over 200,000 university students our technology at no cost, and have invested more than $65 million in education-related technology in Panama over the past two years.</p><h4>How would you assess your financial performance in Panama?</h4><p>Over the past three years, we have increased our revenues significantly. I was assigned to Panama to increase growth, and to keep pace with GDP, which in previous years was growing faster than Microsoft. We therefore adopted an aggressive strategy to keep pace, while investing in the country, by bringing more talent in and hiring more local staff than ever before. That is part of the reason behind our marked investments in education. This is the only means of staying ahead in the future. Panama will need close to 10,000 new engineers over the coming five years, yet there are currently less than 1,600 university students studying engineering. Panama is following Singapore's model, as 50% of that country's population is comprised of locals, with 50% being foreigners. Sooner or later, the same scenario will repeat itself here. Importing talent is the only means of keeping up with local universities that are not able or capable of developing the talent we need to maintain growth.</p><h4>Public and private R&amp;D investment in Panama represents less than 0.3% of GDP. What is your assessment of this?</h4><p>It is too risk-laden a venture for a company like Microsoft to establish an R&amp;D facility in Panama due to the prevailing piracy rate. Intellectual property rights are not yet well established here, which curbs the opportunity of pursuing R&amp;D. It would be difficult even to support small third-party companies to develop local intellectual property at this level. We do have good laws and regulations that stipulate penalties, and yet the reality is that the regulations are not enforced. In this context, we are working with the Ministry of Commerce and Industries by proposing the idea of training its staff to understand how to identify companies and individuals contravening the law. It is not always easy to understand what is legal and what is not in the software industry.</p><h4>What role could Panama play as a regional technology hub?</h4><p>What we have in this market is a logistic hub, which is totally different. Indeed, the main contributor to GDP growth in Panama is the logistics sector. Construction's contribution to GDP is growing, although predominantly in terms of the building of logistics facilities, centers where operations are run like a distribution service. The Panama Canal is the main factor of course, but COPA, the national airline, is also growing in terms of logistics. The economy is growing through finance and logistics, both of which are the key engines of growth today. This is the main reason why companies such as Caterpillar and Procter &amp; Gamble are establishing their regional headquarters here. However, from a technology perspective, Panama will not become a technology hub in the short term. This said, it could become a reference point for technology application, as we know that it will see the establishment of remarkable smart cities.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Colombia is currently third in the QS Latin American University rankings, behind Brazil and Mexico, but ahead of Chile and Argentina. Could you evaluate the current state of Colombia's university education system?</h4><p>Colombia has a centuries-old tradition of education. However, while there are around 300 universities or institutions in Colombia, only 30 are accredited by the Ministry of Education, and of those 30 only 10 have been accredited for just under a decade. The Universidad Externado de Colombia was founded in 1886 as the first non-religious university in the country. It was founded in retaliation to absolutism and the suppression of the freedom of education imposed by the dictatorship of the “La Regeneración." Our university was born following the various civil wars that were fought in the country between 1860 and 1885. The causes of the Colombian Civil War of 1876, also known as the War of the Schools, dated back to approximately 1870 when members of the Colombian Liberal Party attempted to introduce public education to the Colombian states, while the Colombian Conservative Party advocated placing education solely under the aegis of the Roman Catholic church. The university was therefore born out of rebellion. This institution has a liberal tradition of free expression, one which we have been proud of for the past 128 years.</p><h4>Which subjects receive the best treatment in Colombian education?</h4><p>Social sciences and economics are solid subjects in Colombia, and are certainly a part of the tradition of our university. Colombia also has a pedigree in subjects such as politics, art, philosophy, and psychology, in addition to having impressive medical departments. Engineering schools are strong too, particularly for courses related to mining. Meanwhile, although in actuality infrastructure in Colombia is short of what it could be, the study of design and engineering is solid. There is extensive research into biodiversity as well, as a result of the country's naturally diverse environment.</p><div class="quote">“Social sciences and economics are solid subjects in Colombia, and are certainly a part of the tradition of our university."</div><h4>You founded the school of Finance, Government, and International Relations in 1986. How do you maintain the founding vision of this first interdisciplinary school for education in Colombia?</h4><p>Actually, this was the first interdisciplinary school in Colombia. We first began to offer studies in different areas that were not available at other schools. We worked together with Sciences Po in Paris. I am a student of that institution, and we have enjoyed strong input from it, having gone on to build a degree program that could offer studies in finance and government. There is a difference between political science and government, and ours was the first school that groomed the professionals who would go on to govern the various institutions of Colombia and other nations, as opposed to just providing an education in political theory. We also offered studies in economy, business management, and international relations. It was the first school that gave professional studies in international relations. We also placed emphasis on languages, whereby our students would graduate with fluent English and French, and are thus prepared to study in English-speaking and French-speaking countries. This school effectively became a model for Colombia for providing the first undergraduate degree to develop professionals in finance and international relations, or government and international relations, as opposed to the more familiar lawyers, engineers, or economists.</p><h4>What sort of demand is there for your graduates?</h4><p>Our degrees are well received in both the private and public sectors. There is also high demand from other countries in Latin America, and we have students in Europe, Asia, Japan, and India. The demand for our graduates comes from a broad range of sectors, and this interdisciplinary focus allows people to develop their skills in different areas to practice working in different sectors. Our students, upon graduation, are prepared for a wide spectrum of professions.</p><h4>In graduate study, the school enjoys collaboration agreements with Columbia University and the Institut d'études politiques de Paris, also known as Sciences Po. How do these collaboration agreements benefit your students?</h4><p>Our research center “Centro de Investigaciones y Proyectos Especiales" (CIPE) enjoyed collaboration with Sciences Po, and in fact the university worked with Sciences Po even before this school was established. We first began exchanging students, and in the undergraduate program offer exchange programs that allow for the homologation of foreign higher education qualifications. In our undergraduate courses we offer joint degrees with universities such as Audencia Nantes École de Management, Rouen Business School, IESEG School of Management, the International University in Geneva, the Instituto de Estudios Bursátiles de Madrid, ESDEN Business School, and the University of Wollongong. The graduate course teachers come from Science Po, while those from New York's Columbia University also teach the various graduate programs. With Columbia, which is ranked 14th in the QS World University Rankings for 2013, we have a double certification agreement. In particular, we work with Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs, which sends around 14 professors to our country every year. The exact agreement with Columbia University enables our students to study in Colombia for a year and go to New York for their second year of their Master's degree after acceptance. In the English-speaking world, we are establishing links with the London School of Economics and working with Cambridge University and Oxford University, among others. We are also working with Irish and Scottish universities and expanding our programs in that region. In the US we are focusing on Californian universities such as UC Berkeley, UCSD, and UCLA. In addition, we are working with Georgetown University in Washington, DC. However, the main problem that students have with exchanges with American and British universities is cost. We are doing a good job in striking reciprocity agreements that mean that people coming from the UK and the US do not pay our fees, while our students are spared fees abroad. Naturally, we have agreements with important universities from Spain such as the Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, and the Universidad de Salamanca. In France also, we have agreements with leading universities such as Pantheon-Sorbonne University, Panthéon-Assas University, Paris-Sorbonne University, and Paris Dauphine University. In addition, we have international agreements with universities in Germany and Finland.</p><h4>How are you preparing your students for a world that increasingly demands people that are bilingual or trilingual? How do you ensure the quality of your language teaching?</h4><p>We have a strong language school with a large staff body of native English-speaking teachers from the UK. We teach intensive courses for six hours a week over four months each semester, as our program is divided into two semesters. One begins in February and ends in June and the other one begins in August and ends in December. We have intensive courses of six hours a week in English and in French, with six levels available in English and four in French. We also provide courses in other languages such as German, Italian, Japanese, Arabic, Mandarin, and Portuguese.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate Garant Holding's performance in 2013?</h4><p>I am happy to say that 2013 was one of the most successful and productive years in our history. We rebranded the holding with a name more readily understandable in many languages and quickly associated with the various companies that operate under the corporate umbrella. Taking on this new name has galvanized our sense of responsibility and stimulated new initiatives and projects. We are the only holding in Azerbaijan to have been recognized by PricewaterhouseCoopers, and have received ISO 9001:2008 certification from TÜV AUSTRIA Hellas, the International Certification Organization. Another highlight of 2013 was the opening of the luxury Rixos hotel in Guba, a pivotal region in Azerbaijan. By completing such projects, we are contributing to the state program for the social and economic development of other provinces in Azerbaijan through tourism facilities. The project is of considerable importance to the holding, but also to Guba, as it has improved infrastructure, involved local residents, and provided employment.</p><h4>What is the focus of Garant's construction segment?</h4><p>A major success in recent years was our efficient and rapid completion of the Trump Tower project. The challenge that we embraced was to ensure that the style of the building was consistent with the surrounding architecture in Baku, and that the project was sustainable. The main challenge that we are facing now is to promote Baku effectively in the international arena. Meanwhile, the construction arm of Garant continues to work on several large-scale projects.</p><div class="quote">“Azerbaijan is a country with a range of available opportunities and conditions for the development of entrepreneurship."</div><h4>In which areas is the agribusiness branch of Garant engaged?</h4><p>Garant has leveraged the success of its financial branch to diversify, having directed its efforts toward the production and manufacturing of food products. One of the initial steps we have taken in this field is the establishment of Ucar Agro LLC, named after the area in which it is based. This time, we have also remained true to the principle of the development of rural regions of Azerbaijan, employing our best people to ensure success. There are many companies engaged in poultry production, but with demand from local consumers being high we have channeled innovative technologies to meet it, resulting in the introduction of a new brand of poultry product. Our poultry processing operation has an annual production capacity of 17 million (live weight) tons with a cutting rate of 6,000 chickens per hour; it will produce fresh and frozen poultry, whole and sliced. The enterprise is valuable and of great importance in providing employment in rural communities. Overall, 590 workers have been involved directly in our production processes, and 150 people have been engaged in related fields of the enterprise.</p><h4>This year has seen the start to the third term in office for President Aliyev. What will this mean for the business community?</h4><p>Azerbaijan is a country with a range of available opportunities and conditions for the development of entrepreneurship. We have the opportunity to operate effectively due to the care and attention of President Ilham Aliyev. As the President has stated, the growth of entrepreneurship in towns and regions will ensure successful national development. He has underlined the need to pursue a liberal economy to this end. In recent years, through the sensible use of incoming exchange reserves from the sale of oil resources, the government has achieved the advantageous base required for the dynamic development of sectors of the economy relevant to strategic, diversified business structures and the development of the broader economy. The generation of oil revenues has contributed to this development and played a pivotal role in the formation and establishment of developmental tendencies within economic and social sectors. Of course, those engaged in entrepreneurial activity will be entering a more large-scale activity phase in large part owing to this productive environment.</p><h4>As the founder of the Azerbaijan America Alliance, how do you evaluate the importance of this bilateral relationship for the country's economic development?</h4><p>The Azerbaijan America Alliance is a non-political, non-profit organization the main goal of which is to deliver broad information regarding the culture, history, way of life, and lifestyle of the country. The Alliance's mission also includes the provision and building of mutual understanding and fostering mutual respect between American and Azerbaijani people. The alliance has arranged successful projects through academic dialogue, cultural programs, and political debates in the US over the span of several years. Our outreach campaign to create awareness of the Khojaly massacre in the US forms a major part of the goals of the alliance, and we have been attempting to convey the importance of this tragedy and crime against humanity to officials there, in order to foster a better understanding of our region's unique geopolitical realities. This program has been focused on informing people in Washington, DC and New York, in order to achieve a high-impact message. My hope is that the Alliance's cultural, political, and economic relations will play an important role in strengthening and promoting more productive and favorable relations.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize Mozambique's progress in terms of technology adoption?</h4><p>Mozambique's progress has been nothing short of remarkable, although the majority of the population does not recognize this fact. For example, in the area of ICT, it is known that even in the most remote areas illiterate people are using cell phones; there has also been a marked improvement in the expansion of e-government in the various districts of the country over the past five years. Biotechnology is being talked about extensively, and with increased mining activity, cutting-edge technologies for the extraction of ores have been brought into use. This said, there is still a large part of the population that utilizes rudimentary technology to carry out, among other things, agriculture- and livestock-related activities.</p><h4>What role can science and technology play in the economic development of Mozambique?</h4><p>Countries that are economically developed today are like this because they invested in science and technological innovation. The use of scientific models for solving day-to-day problems, plus appropriate technology for these purposes, has room to grow, such as, for example, in the sector of agriculture and livestock, decreasing exports, and increasing imports, which will lead to an increase in the gross domestic product of the country. Without a doubt, the development of Mozambique is linked to its investment in scientific research and in human resources training. Through the creation and rapid diffusion of knowledge based on scientific research, technological progress, and social experience, science and technology have become the main drivers of change in both developed and developing nations. In the emerging knowledge economy, ICT is a key component of its development, driven by knowledge, particularly in the growing service industries and global markets. We believe that the development of this socio-economic pearl of the Indian Ocean not only depends on the allocation of resources, but on the level of knowledge or research that Mozambicans, particularly the new generation, can accomplish. For us, innovation must be the engine of Mozambique's socio-economic development. At the microeconomic level, innovation can increase companies' productivity and profitability and positively change market sizes. At the macroeconomic level, it should improve the level of income and employment, and access regional and international markets. Therefore, for Mozambique to achieve its desired socio-economic development, we must urgently go for approaches that emphasize a knowledge-based economy, in which the synergies of relationships between education and research institutions, and private industry and government, are increasingly important. The primary role of the government of Mozambique is the creation of a favorable environment for scientific and technological development. The manufacturing sector, comprising private and public companies, has the task of acting as the fulcrum of innovation.</p><div class="quote">“Countries that are economically developed today are like this because they invested in science and technological innovation."</div><h4>How would you characterize the significance of the Maluana Science and Technology Park for Mozambique's technological development?</h4><p>This park is a symbol of awareness of a need for the country to develop science and technology. Such parks provide a medium for the creation of infrastructure and appropriate space in one locale for cutting-edge research, education, incubation, entrepreneurship, innovation, and technological development. This is a first for the country, and, due to the size of Mozambique, there is a need for additional parks in other parts of the country to enable integrated development. It is also a challenge because we need this first experience to yield results to justify the investment made so that other Science and Technology Park initiatives can be achieved. The Maluana Science and Technology Park, at a distance of 60 kilometers north of Maputo, has great significance for Mozambique's technological development since this complex will enable the development of scientific research, promote innovation and the development of human capital, and the establishment of incubators and technology-based commerce. If we align the activities of higher education, scientific research, and innovation institutions that will determine the generation and accommodation of technology-based businesses, as well as products and services that may also have applications beyond Mozambique, then there is excellent potential here. This park also includes activities related to research in areas such as biotechnology and ethno-botany. It is in this park where infrastructure important for the economic and social life of the country will be located, such as the data center, which will serve not only the government, but also the national and foreign private sector.</p><h4>What efforts is the government making to meet the challenges that Mozambique faces in terms of technological infrastructure?</h4><p>Government efforts to meet the challenges of technological infrastructure that Mozambique faces are based on the promotion of a program of support and the creation of science and technology infrastructure, aimed at consolidating and qualifying the supply of technologies and services. In terms of the physical infrastructure and equipment components, creating expansion projects or the rehabilitation of existing technological infrastructure may also be considered on an exceptional basis to develop physical infrastructure. This could comprise specific buildings and facilities for common use, as well as lab equipment, and others, enabling the development of expertise in technological areas relevant to the competitiveness of companies and/or the diffusion of knowledge. We seek to promote the consolidation of science and technological infrastructure to avoid the duplication of entities with overlapping objectives, while also promoting the inclusion of this infrastructure in regional and international networks. The efforts of the government include the adaptation, renewal, upgrading, and expansion of scientific equipment and the infrastructure of scientific and technological institutions, including the remodeling or upgrading of scientific infrastructure to promote safety and energy efficiency. The efforts of the Ministry of Science and Technology can be seen through a number of initiatives such as the Millennium Villages, an integrated development program based in impoverished communities operating on the principle that scientific knowledge can foster economic and social development. There are numerous examples of institutions involved in this research, such as the Center for Research and Development in Ethno-Botany (CIDE), the Center for Research and Transfer of Technologies for Community Development (CITT), Maluana Science and Technology Park, Community Multimedia Centers (CMCs), the Umbelúzi Centre for Research and Transfer of Agricultural Technologies (CITTAU), the Xai-Xai Laboratory of Marine Biotechnology, and the National Center of Biotechnology and Bioscience (CNBB).</p><h4>What are your policy priorities over the coming year?</h4><p>The great challenge comes from the need to transform science, technology, and productive innovation into the primary driving force in our efforts to eradicate poverty in Mozambique. In this context we believe it is necessary to ensure that scientists located in research institutions produce knowledge that is geared toward the production of food. Special attention should be given to the improvement of productivity, production, and post-harvest technology and the issue of water resources, and to ensuring that knowledge is available, affordable, and easily transferable to the market, especially rural communities with higher rates of poverty. Our main priorities can be broken down into the following: human resources, infrastructure and facilities, knowledge transfer, and improved legislative regulation of technology-related activities.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The School of Management was founded in 1972 and you are the first school in Colombia to have earned the Triple Crown. What is the significance of this?</h4><p>From the start, Los Andes has defined itself as a School of Management, rather than a business school. We cover a wider range of issues, from public administration, environmental management, NGOs, and development practice to business. In 2011 we broadened our mission statement to include innovation and the sustainable development of organizations. We chose “organizations" because our students and alumni are prepared to work with any organization. Earning the Triple Crown—three different self-assessment processes—has been a vital force to guide our school on a path of continuous improvement, internalizing change, raising standards, and shaping global ties. Boasting the Triple Crown fosters relationships and uncovers opportunities with other top schools in Asia, Europe, and North America.</p><h4>How does your alliance with Yale University work, and why has one of your Master's programs been recognized as Latin America's best?</h4><p>Our Master's in Environmental Management is recognized in Eduniversal's university ranking as the best in Latin America. Our close ties with the Yale School of Forestry got started with a grant from the Moore Foundation. Five of our faculty members teach a course at Yale, and Yale School of Forestry students earn a double degree by enrolling in our MBA, a Master's in Environmental Management from Yale and an MBA from Los Andes. Scholarship support from the Moore Foundation also enabled our school to attract students from other Latin American countries. We are now in talks with ESAN Business School in Peru to develop an Environmental Management program in Lima.</p><div class="quote">“Our Master's in Environmental Management is recognized in Eduniversal's university ranking as the best in Latin America."</div><h4>How do you foster a relationship between academia and the business world and forge the type of links and work experience that you offer to your students?</h4><p>Let me start with the undergraduates; we take students on business visits so they can learn about different industries firsthand. Also, for both graduate and undergraduate students, we offer a learning experience called Consultandes, a consultancy through which business firms come to Los Andes, tell us about a particular problem, and we assign teams of students to act as consultants to those firms during a full semester, recommending a solution. Students gain practical experience, the school learns of current issues of concern to business, and the firms get valuable solutions and/or alternatives. Business and government are linked to the school in several ways. Once a month, a top manager or government official is invited as a guest speaker to a session for all Master's students. Every semester we hold a job fair and company representatives interview students entering the job market and alumni seeking a change. At the CEO level, our Presidentes de Empresa program brings together heads of firms and ranking public officials for a half-day session, once a month, to focus on a given issue of national interest, such as innovation and entrepreneurship. CEOs participating in the program have organized themselves into teams to contribute to the school by becoming mentors to students and being involved in activities that enhance the school's profile.</p><h4>How do your dual programs work and which are the leading universities where your students can study?</h4><p>For some years we have offered dual degrees with Tulane University as well as FIU in Florida and Toulouse in France. In addition to our academic ties with Yale, and our Master's in Development Practice, offered together with Columbia University's Earth Science Institute, we are now reviewing student exchange, executive education, and other partnering opportunities with a long list of schools, including Cornell and Stanford in the US and ESADE in Spain. Without a doubt the newly launched Pacific Alliance—Chile, Mexico, Peru, and Colombia— will draw us toward Asia. We are signing an agreement with Keio University in Japan, and exploring opportunities with Hong Kong Polytechnic University.</p><h4>Many students who consider studying in Latin America opt for Mexico first, followed by Costa Rica, Argentina, Chile, and Ecuador. Why do you believe that foreign students should study in Bogotá, and what competitive advantages does Colombia have?</h4><p>Many people still view Colombia as a dangerous country, but this has changed over the past decade. Bogotá is a good point of entry to better understand Latin America. Colombia is a country of regions, and Latin America is certainly a continent of regions. Each country is different, and business customs differ from one country to another. At our school, we already have faculty members from Argentina, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, and Venezuela. We also plan to hire faculty from Brazil, Chile, and Mexico. And we also have faculty from North America and Europe. A key strength of our school is being part of Universidad de Los Andes, a ranking Latin American university with a large campus housed in handsome colonial and modern buildings in downtown Bogotá, offering students the opportunity to interact with engineers, physicists, musicians, social scientists, physicians enrolled in the MBA, and a much wider range of students than is typical of business schools generally.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[growth-starts-here]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role can science and technology play in promoting the economic growth of Mexico?</h4><p>The support of scientific and technological activities, as well as of innovation, is essential in boosting economic development. President Enrique Peña Nieto realizes this and has shown his commitment to reaching a total expenditure in innovation, science, and technology of 1% of GDP. In 2012, expenditure in these areas reached 0.43% of GDP, whereas in 2013 it was already at 0.5%. It is important to create synergies between diverse economic players; government efforts should be supported by private initiatives and also by the academic sector. This cooperation should contribute to incorporating technological developments and scientific research for Mexico's productive matrix.</p><h4>What is your opinion on the study from Public Policy Laboratory Ethos, which suggests that Mexico needs a better distribution of public resources in order to achieve successful tax reform?</h4><p>The government should streamline spending and allocate it to those sectors of the economy that have a real impact in terms of productivity and competitiveness. This approach is fully in line with the vision of President Peña Nieto, in the sense of promoting the efficient use and allocation of factors of production in the economy, including government spending. According to our National Development Plan, today, 46% of our population lives in poverty. For this administration, this is an urgent call to action, not only with financial discipline, but also responsible and efficient public spending, with a clear sense of social justice. The tax reform aims to promote a progressive and simpler tax system that raises the financial capacity of the Mexican state to meet its obligations through more efficient infrastructure spending, social security, and the fight against poverty. In Mexico, tax revenues represent 13.7% of GDP, while the average in Latin America and the OECD is 18.4% and 26.3%, respectively. Our public spending accounts for 19.5% of GDP, while in Latin America the figure is 27.1% and at 46.5% in the OECD. This data shows us that low tax revenues have been one of the factors curbing our spending and, consequently, the possibility of redistributing income in this way to reduce social gaps. The tax reform is to compensate for these differences and generate greater benefits, especially for those who have less.</p><div class="quote">“The TPP is the most important and ambitious multilateral trade framework that exists internationally for its coverage of products."</div><h4>How will the signature of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) economic association agreement impact Mexico's commercial ties?</h4><p>The TPP is the most important and ambitious multilateral trade framework that exists internationally for its coverage of products, spanning the disciplines and economic and commercial importance of the countries that comprise it. This agreement will give Mexico preferential access to six markets in the Asia-Pacific, and will facilitate the integration of national exports to Asian production chains, strengthening Mexico's position as well as our role as a commercial and investment platform. In our region, the TPP will boost the integration of global value chains, which means, on the one hand greater intra-regional exports, and on the other new opportunities for joint production and exports to TPP markets, where Mexico's exports have shown greater dynamism. Over the past eight years, exports from Mexico to the markets of the US and Canada have grown by an average annual rate of 6.9%, while in the TPP markets the growth rate was 15%.</p><h4>According to IMF estimates, Mexico's economy decelerated in 2013. What are the reasons behind this?</h4><p>A combination of multiple internal and external factors was the cause of the modest growth registered in 2013. Internationally, moderate growth in the US, the slowing of productive activity in various emerging economies, and observed volatility in international financial markets were some of the factors that caused a decrease in the rate of expansion of external demand for the export products of Mexico. From a domestic perspective, the lower spending in 4Q2012 and 1H2013, resulting from the change in administration, highlighted the slowdown in domestic demand. Finally, the negative trend in the housing sector influenced the weak performance of the construction industry, which accounts for 20% of industrial activity and exhibits cyclical behavior.</p><h4>What is your general outlook for the impact of the recent economic reforms over the medium term?</h4><p>There are two key elements in assessing the benefits of the economic reforms implemented by this administration; the first is time, meaning how long it will take to see the constitutional reforms translated into laws and secondary regulations, and actually impacting the economy. The second element is the actual depth of the reform. Educational reform needs several years to show results fully reflected in the economic and the social productivity of the workforce. Instead, tax reform could offer more expeditious results in consolidating public finances. The labor, financial, and energy reforms have different thresholds and complexity levels. It is estimated that once the complete package of structural reforms is implemented, it will increase the potential growth of the Mexican economy from about 3.5% to 5.3% by 2018. The proper implementation of these reforms is a key element in increasing the attractiveness of Mexico as a destination for domestic and foreign investment, which will result in more formal and better-paid jobs, thereby accelerating national productivity and benefiting many Mexican families. In 2013, Mexico received a record amount of FDI at $38.3 billion, although it should be noted that a portion of this amount was due to the acquisition of Grupo Modelo by AB Inbev, which was a $13.2 billion operation. Even subtracting this transaction, the total net amount of FDI in 2013 was $25.1 billion, an increase of $7.5 billion on the $17.6 billion of 2012. This amount exceeds the average for the past five years ($20 billion). For 2014, we expect a minimum of $25 billion, and depending on the speed of implementation of structural reforms, we could be aiming for levels of $30 billion.</p><h4>Could you comment on measures being implemented to curb Mexico's informal economy?</h4><p>According to the National Survey on Financial Inclusion, in 2012, 44% of the adult population (18-70 years), almost 31 million people, had purchased items through the formal financial system. This survey also revealed that approximately 43% of adults save via different mechanisms to those offered by financial institutions; they prefer saving in cash (64.8%), or participating in pools of collective savings known as “tandas" (31.7%). Also, the survey found that 33% of adults prefer informal financing through loans from the family (57.4%), or friends (40.3%). The financial reform is based on four pillars: promoting credit through the Development Bank; increased competition in the financial sector; extending credit from private financial institutions; and ensuring the development of the financial sector as a whole. The common goal of these four actions is to strengthen and increase financial inclusion among those often neglected or marginalized by commercial banks, to expand the range of financial products and services available, to reduce financial transaction costs and increase affordability of credit via competition, and to improve the quality of financial products and services by ensuring the soundness of banks.</p><h4>What are your economic perspectives for Mexico for 2014?</h4><p>In 2013, we experienced growth that was below the potential of our economy; however, the cyclical indicators that INEGI published recently confirmed that we are in the final stage of the slowdown and our economy is heading toward recovery. As a demonstration, the main economic indicators are beginning to show positive signs; industrial activity grew 3.4% in March 2014 and reported an annual growth of 6.8%. For the month of May, the IMSS reported an annual increase of 3.2% in employment. There has been an 80.5% (427,029 positions) growth of permanent-type jobs and 19.5% (103,289) in other types of jobs. In terms of retail, an important indicator of the state of our domestic market, April data for the National Association of Supermarkets and Department Stores (ANTAD), suggests that for stores with more than a year in operation, there was annual nominal growth of 2.4%, while total sales experienced annual nominal growth of 6.8%. By the second half of 2014, we expect to see a start in the recovery of the growth rate, which according to some organizations and economic analysts will be between 2.5% and 3% in 2014, and at least 4% by 2015.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you provide us a quick overview of the food and beverage market here in Oman?</h4><p>Oman Refreshment Company (ORC) operates in different categories of the food and beverage market in Oman. Carbonated soft drinks is our main forte, which includes Pepsi, Mountain Dew, 7UP, and other world famous PepsiCo products. In that category, we have an 89% market share. We are amongst the top-10 countries in the world with the highest market share in that category. Then we have the water category, in which we are also among the top-three players in the market with an 11% market share and are growing fast, at around 20%-25% annually. Aquafina is our core brand in that area. The third category is non-carbonated beverages (NCB), like Tropicana, Lipton Ice Tea, Gatorade, and the like. We are the market leader in non-carbonated beverages. The fourth category is juice, in which we have our own brand, Top Fruit, and we are among the top-three players here also. The final category is snacks, including the Lays and Doritos brands. In this category as well, we are among the top-three players in Oman. We are currently a distributor of the Lays range of snacks in Oman, and not a manufacturer, but in the future we plan to be a manufacturer as well.</p><h4>Are the tastes of the local population changing?</h4><p>They are changing for a few reasons. Firstly, people are becoming more conscious of their health and wellness. This is why we are focusing on three categories. “The fun for you" range includes brands that are preferred by our loyal consumers, such as Mountain Dew, Pepsi, Lays, and Cheetos. “The Better for you" range includes brands such as Diet Pepsi, Diet 7UP, Lays Forno, and Sunbites. And “the good for you" range includes brands such as Aquafina, Gatorade, Lipton Ice Tea, Top Fruit, and other products. In our portfolio, we have products that fit each consumer segment based on these three categories. As an example, Mountain Dew is a brand that commands a lone share of over 40% in the total carbonated beverages in Oman. Mountain Dew is the preferential brand for Omani consumers. Worldwide, Oman ranks as the number one for consumer preference of the brand. We try to provide the right product for each occasion, each consumer taste, and each age group. We have products for people that like light products that also taste good. We have Diet Pepsi and Diet 7UP, and we offer water for people that don't want sugar or artificial sweeteners. When it comes to our revenue as a company, we are a listed entity, so those numbers are public; during 2013, our revenue was OMR69 million, compared to OMR66.7 million in 2012. We have grown significantly over the past five years; in 2009, we were at OMR42.7 million in terms of revenue. In terms of coverage, we have nine distribution centers across Oman and cover more than 12,000 retail outlets through direct distribution. In terms of customer reach, we are among the largest companies here in Oman.</p><h4>What role does logistics play in your business?</h4><p>We have a quite robust logistics network. Our strategy is to expand the capacity of our nine distribution centers, or depots, as we commonly refer to them. In 2012, we started building a huge warehouse in Sohar, which was completed in early 2013. Similarly, a new separate central warehouse has been built in our Muscat headquarters to cater to the growing snacks segment. Our plan in each location, from a warehouse standpoint, is to have enough capacity to cater for the next 15 years. We are currently building two warehouses, which will be completed before the end of 2014, and then we will follow that every year with other warehouses. We have also invested in renovating and expanding our existing warehouse in Muscat, where we have moved all our warehousing to a racking system with different racking tools employing new technologies, like gravity racks. What we have in Muscat in 2014 is 2.5 times the warehousing capacity of 2013. That is just one side of the business. The other side is that, from a logistics standpoint, we used to operate with many logistics providers for the intra-depot transfer of our products, but now we have reduced that down to few major service providers and we have increased the capacity of the trucks, which really provided some added value to our organization. They are more cost efficient, better maintained, and also keep the goods at the right temperature.</p><div class="quote">“In 2012, we started building a huge warehouse in Sohar, which was completed in early 2013."</div><h4>What is the relevance of the agreement that you have recently signed with CHEP?</h4><p>We used to buy pallets, and then we developed a workshop that would repair them. I had agreed with the board that we needed to focus on the core business, whereby we could add value to things that were critical to our consumer. We focus on the consumer delight. That is our job. Any task or duties outside that are not core duties can either be outsourced or made into secondary services. One of these was the pallets. We are not experts in that business. We used to spend a lot of money repairing them, and we didn't have the right monitoring for those pallets in the system. Now CHEP takes care of that and we have software that monitors all the pallet movements, thanks to which we have seen a remarkable improvement.</p><h4>What factors and trends will lead your growth in Oman in the future?</h4><p>First, the population growth is leading to a general widening of the economy. Continued government spending on the infrastructure projects and the oil recovery enhancement initiatives, besides the major investments committed in oil and gas sector, would drive the employment opportunities, thereby widening the customer base for any retail business in Oman. On top of that, a lot of market-driven initiatives focusing on consumers are pushing more people toward our products. In the case of water, for example, more and more people are becoming conscious of the quality of water they drink and are opting for our Aquafina. People becoming more conscious of quality will grow and drive our business. Consumers like our products, so we've launched a lot of initiatives, including partnering with the best football player in the world Lionel Messi, for which we had some unique flavors of Lays made. We are focusing on customer preferences and responding to that demand.</p><h4>What segment of the population are you focusing on?</h4><p>Our main focus is probably the 20-30 year age group. However, our products cater to all ages. And for kids, although we do not target them directly, we do have two varieties of Top Fruit, namely juice nectar and juice drink. We offer 30% nectar and we cover around 30% of the schools in Oman. We are also a partner of many major cultural and economic events, such as the UN's World Water Day under the regional municipalities and Water Resources Ministry, the Muscat Festival, which is close to 30 days of celebration and is a great event, the Salalah Khareef festival, and more.</p><h4>What is the importance of human capital and Omanization in your company?</h4><p>The Ministry of Manpower has set Omanization targets for each sector. For the manufacturing industry, the target is 35%. Our Omanization rate is 42%. In that respect, we are seven points higher than the target. There are managers, supervisors, skilled works, and semi-skilled workers. For each category, we are trying to achieve that minimum number. To get that golden figure requires hiring the right people with the right skills and attitude. We also offer incentives to our staff to recommend new employees. Then, if their recommended person is recruited, they receive an incentive. Oman Refreshment also has a training and development budget for the entire company, focusing on Omanis in particular. We have a program working on different fronts, such as technical skills. For that, we have the PepsiCo University, which is focused on leadership skills, marketing and technical skills, and so on. It is a long-term program. We have other programs, also through PepsiCo University. We are working to be among the top 10% of players in Oman's FMCG market and we review the situation constantly—the strategy is to benchmark ourselves to the leading players every two years. This year we have selected the 15 best Omani employees, then held a separate felicitation ceremony for them with valuable gifts for their good work. We have an annual bonus system that focuses on employee performance as well.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>With over 20 years of experience in the financial sector, what have been your landmark achievements since becoming President of Banistmo in October 2013?</h4><p>I would say that our main achievements have been the way customers welcomed us—both brand and bank from the very first day—and the extremely warm and pleasant welcome our 1,500 partners gave me personally. These two elements combined have enabled us to achieve impressive growth and expansion during this year.</p><h4>After Grupo Bancolombia acquired HSBC'soperations in Panama, it decided to rename the bank Banistmo. What were the core reasons behind the decision?</h4><p>Bancolombia's business vision promotes a more human banking model, i.e. banks that admire people and prioritize quality, inclusiveness, and respect. There was no better way to prove, on our arrival to Panama, before the eyes of customers, our respect toward the brand we represent in this country. Banistmo is an old and well-recognized brand in this country, and that is why the company decided to bring it back.</p><div class="quote">“Bancolombia's business vision promotes a more human banking model."</div><h4>Which segments will capitalize on your future growth?</h4><p>Our current strategy has two main pillars; transforming the organizational culture, meaning to make all our partners inclusive in the bank's activity and its development, and achieving a closer level of communication with our clients. Banistmo is a universal bank; we cover all types of clients with comprehensive products and services. Our growth strategy is to strengthen our presence in all segments of the market. Today, Panama offers some interesting opportunities, one being increased banking penetration among those of lower purchasing power, a segment we will grow in, among others.</p><h4>After the purchase, Banistmo became one of the leading institutions in the sector with a market share of 14% in personal and corporate banking. What are your expectations for 2014?</h4><p>When taking over in Panama, we are setting a growth goal at the same level of the banking and finance sectors. The country has a growth expectation of around 6% to 7%, whereas the industry will be around the 10% mark. We expect to be in line with this growth. During the first half of 2014, we have achieved great results, consolidating our presence in key segments with key products. For example, we have seen a positive and promising rise in the demand for mortgages, a clear representation of the growth of the construction sector and the increase in Panamanians' purchasing power. We have also experienced positive growth in other segments such as corporate banking, and expect the same for the end of 2014.</p><h4>How would you assess the development of the banking and finance sector in Panama?</h4><p>This sector has experienced positive and dynamic growth, positioning Panama as a regional finance and banking hub. There is a strong presence of multinationals in the sector. There is also a strong presence of Colombian banks, reinforcing the idea of a regional hub. Panama is a logistics and banking hub, and this regional leadership opens many opportunities for Panamanian banks to expand operations to other neighboring and traditional markets. The positive and dynamic trends we have experienced in the past few years will only become more relevant in the near future.</p><h4>Banistmo is the only Panamanian bank listed in the Dow Jones sustainability index. What is the significance of this for your institution?</h4><p>Our commitment to sustainability is considerable, and represents a hugely important part of our activity. All in all, it proves that we are not only here to become a relevant player in the economy, but a relevant actor in society, too. When talking about correlated parties and partners, we look for those that share our values. We have a group of volunteers that represent around 25% of our workforce that engages in activities aimed at improving quality of life, from the cultural and social point of view, for over 25,000 children in Panama. We do this in collaboration with a large network of foundations and other institutions. For example, we are active actors in SOS Children Villages in Panama. We enjoy a solid relationship with the Panama Channel Foundation and Nature Foundation, as well as a number of other such institutions, to improve the quality of life of people living along the river basin.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the upcoming OECD review of Panama?</h4><p>Panama has achieved much from a financial perspective. For example, it has signed around 19 double taxation agreements, increasing efforts to bring international standards into the finance and banking sector. One of the main challenges now is to continue adapting our industry to global standards in regulatory terms. The upcoming review will contribute to better identifying our challenges and the necessary tasks. This will only help us to become stronger, more efficient, and will strengthen our regional leadership.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[on-the-gas]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the importance of BG's assets in Tanzania in relation to BG's overall strategy?</h4><p>Tanzania is a great example of how BG works to its competitive advantages. Our group strategy focuses on the exploration and LNG segments. We entered Tanzania in 2010, driven by an exploratory analysis of the country's suitability and potential for exploration success, and natural gas exports to customers in Asia, where demand for energy is growing strongly. In addition, we saw an excellent opportunity to meet Tanzania's growing domestic energy needs. The early exploration work we did indicated that there were some potentially very large gas-prone basins, and to date we've made multiple discoveries, with total gross recoverable resources of around 15 trillion cubic feet. We've also made good progress on the proprietary work needed to progress the selection and acquisition of a site for an LNG terminal. This puts Tanzania squarely among the leading opportunities BG Group is pursuing, alongside Canada and the US, to expand our LNG business. We focus on identifying exploration opportunities early, moving swiftly to make discoveries, and then developing world-class LNG projects and supplying LNG into our global LNG marketing business. We're still at an early stage in Tanzania, but we've made an encouraging start.</p><h4>What are your short-term expectations regarding your ongoing exploration activities in blocks 1, 3, and 4?</h4><p>We've had a 100% success rate with offshore Tanzania so far, succeeding in 15 out of 15 wells since 2010. That's really amazing in this industry, where exploration wells often have a success probability of 10%-20%. A total of 10 of those were discovery wells, and the other five were appraisal wells, and we've also performed three successful drill stem tests on those discoveries. These have proven sufficient resources for a two-train LNG project. We're currently conducting further appraisal and exploration work, and we'll be moving on to preparing for another phase of exploration, probably in 2016 or 2017. So we'll be doing a lot of preparation work for that next campaign. What's really exciting is that, in addition to our exploration work program, we're now moving ahead with what we call the “select phase," where we conduct careful analysis of different options for developing the proven gas resources we have. This includes detailed design to determine the best configuration for our offshore and onshore facilities, as well as maturing the commercial structure of the entire project. Our joint venture partners, including the Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation, and also various government agencies, will be involved in maturing the commercial structure, with the signing of these agreements targeted for 2015. Overall, I'm proud of everything we've achieved to date, and I expect the next 12 months will be an exciting and pivotal period.</p><h4>How can Tanzania fully realize its vast potential as an LNG exporter?</h4><p>We have a very large upstream project that we're progressing and developing, and we've formed a consortium to develop a joint LNG project. That's between ourselves and our partners (Ophir Energy and Pavilion Energy) in block 1, 3, and 4 and with the consortium for block 2, which is Statoil and ExxonMobil, which have also discovered significant gas resources. In 2012, the government asked us to explore the opportunity of building a joint LNG plant. It's a great opportunity for everyone involved because it saves on costs and it's a more efficient solution. So we're working with officials on that, and we've now agreed with those five companies and the government that we will work together on the feasibility of that energy project over the next couple of years, and BG will take a lead role in that consortium. We've established a joint venture team with representatives from all organizations. We have an office here in Dar es Salaam and also one in London for that joint venture to progress the work. I'm also very excited by the way that in both the joint venture for the LNG plant and the upstream operation, we're working very carefully and closely with Tanzania to help build a platform to maximize Tanzanian involvement in the project, and use the capacity of Tanzanian institutions and local companies to construct and operate the project.</p><div class="quote">“We've formed a consortium to develop a joint LNG project."</div><h4>How is BG Group working to further increase its level of local content?</h4><p>We're dedicated to improving livelihoods and supporting development in Tanzania through our investment activities. We've only been here a few years, but we've already made some strides there. BG has established a dedicated offshore drilling supply base in Mtwara in collaboration with Ophir and Statoil. As part of this we have upgraded the port in Mtwara in collaboration with the Tanzanian Ports Authority (TPA), investing about $40 million, 70% of which has been invested through Tanzanian-registered companies. That involved working with them to make sure they're able to meet international oil and gas safety and quality standards. That's been successful, and it's a statistic we're very proud of. We're committed to continuing to work with the local government and companies in Tanzania to maximize local content throughout our operations while maintaining the safety and quality standards that we expect. There are things we need to do to make that happen, obviously, as it isn't going to happen by itself. We have a big part to play, as has the government and other institutions. The key is to have the human capacity to take this on. So we're taking an education pipeline approach to that, and we have a number of social investment initiatives to support this approach. It's important to get young people interested in the key disciplines that are important in oil and gas, so we have a partnership with Young Scientists Tanzania (YST), which runs a science competition in schools in all regions of Tanzania. The final factor starts at home; we have a lot of national staff in our organization, and a point we're particularly proud of is our international graduate development program. In the past two years we've recruited nine Tanzanians from universities. They then go on a two-year program where they work in three to four other countries that are part of our international operations around the world. After that they move into roles within the company. We have also been providing scholarships for higher education in science-related studies. From 2012 to date, 14 students have been sponsored to pursue Master's studies at British universities. Areas of study include Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Petroleum Engineering, Petroleum Geophysics, and Oil and Gas Chemistry. From 2012 to date eight students have also been sponsored to pursue Master's studies in Materials Science Engineering at the Nelson Mandela Institute of Technology in Arusha.</p><h4>What are BG's short-term goals in Tanzania?</h4><p>The key for us is finding the right options for developing our proven gas resources. We've got the gas, and we know what we're going to do with the gas. We just have to figure out how we're going to connect those two things together. We need to choose from several options for accomplishing that, and that's our key objective for 2015. This includes selecting some options, and then doing some detailed design work to develop the best configuration for our upstream and LNG facilities. Once that is complete we will be  preparing for the bidding, evaluation, and award of the contracts for the detailed design of these facilities. We'll also be making concrete steps in maturing the commercial structure of the entire project with the government and our joint venture partners. So that's the next big challenge, and it's a very exciting period for us.</p><h4>What is your long-term outlook for the sector in general?</h4><p>Natural gas projects are complex and costly and they can take many years to develop. And so for BG, the next step means doing rigorous assessments and studies aimed at understanding the full impact of the investment that we plan to make, not just on the technical side but also in terms of the social and environmental impact we have on Tanzania. We'll be looking at those very carefully to make sure that we select measures that either avoid or offset any social or environmental impact the project would have. Once that's all done we can make a decision on whether to proceed with the LNG project, which we expect to be made sometime after the end of 2016, with the first gas produced early in the next decade. The project would have an operational lifespan in excess of 20 years. So in that time period I expect to see, as other countries have, a progressive increase in the participation of the Tanzanian economy in the project. More importantly, I think this project can be decisive in contributing to the government's goal of becoming a middle-income country by 2025. We're very excited about Tanzania.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[build-up-not-out]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you explain the reasons for the positive momentum Colombia's real estate sector is experiencing?</h4><p>I think there are three key factors: first, the internal and external perception that there's room for economic growth; second, the growth of companies that creates employment, allowing people to start spending on basic goods and services—middle-class growth has doubled over the past 10 years and, culturally speaking, Colombians prioritize investment in their own homes; and finally, there's an imminent need to modernize our real estate infrastructure, such as offices, shopping centers, logistics facilities, and the like.</p><h4>One of the most interesting products within the sector is residential real estate. What sort of construction projects are most necessary now in cities like Bogotá or other cities you have experience in?</h4><p>The residential segment is always the most interesting in any growing economy. Government incentives for VIS and VIP housing have been determining factors for first-home access for Colombian families. Another issue motivating growth is the government commitment to subsidize 100% of a home's value. In any case, I think we haven't seen the full potential of this plan; we still continue to reinvent it, having many social gaps to fill before we can say implementation is completely successful. In Colombia, we have more than 12 cities with approximately 500,000 inhabitants and a housing deficit of more 2 million and an annual production of 150,000 houses. There is huge growth potential in this segment. Additionally, housing purchases begin with the 20- to 40-year-old demographic, the largest and most fully productive segment of Colombia's population pyramid. Other sectors are consumer goods and the need for commercial spaces in mid-sized cities; and we must not forget the government's connectivity and infrastructure development projects and how these will drive distribution and logistics platforms in underdeveloped places in the country.</p><div class="quote">“CREA's objective is to structure successful commercial projects, thus filling a gap in the market."</div><h4>Could you share with us your view regarding the potential for a price bubble in different strata of residential real estate here in Bogotá?</h4><p>Bubbles are driven by oversupply and excessive debt, but I do not really see a bubble. Instead, I see a scarcity of land due to the absence of urban renewal legislation, mainly in Bogotá. It is very difficult to find areas larger than 2,500 sqm to build interesting developments that make urban sense, and which could include complementary, mixed-use spaces. My perception is that we are making updates very rapidly, that land prices aren't in keeping up with construction capacity according to the norm (residual value), and that the city needs to grow denser, vertically, rather than expanding horizontally. Therefore, when we refer to the financial part, borrowing is controlled at the real estate level. I believe that the financial crisis of the late 1990s left us well regulated in this aspect.  Prices are sustained by demand in the northern area of Bogotá, and at the limits of Stratum 6, as a housing area; it's for this reason that the city desperately needs urban renewal areas, and this includes the development of infrastructure and public transportation.</p><h4>In 2013, Jones Lang LaSalle declared that the hotel sector was one of the most interesting and exciting markets here in Colombia and Latin America. Can you share your perspectives regarding this sector and the possibility of gaining exposure through real estate investment trusts (REITs)?</h4><p>We needed to update hotel infrastructure to be aligned with the economic growth of the last 10 years. The government of Alvaro Uribe understood this clearly and implemented tax exemptions to motivate the sector to grow. The fiscal incentive implemented at that time also encouraged independent developments; however, the major brands are the ones that will have a great market advantage. There are many regions in Colombia ripe for the tourism industry, including local tourism, and this is a great opportunity. On the other hand, REITs are a topic of investment regulation. Institutional funds already introduce the possibility for individuals to invest as well as the trust investments. Popular investment in the real estate market is a great advancement, a step toward the sophistication of our capital markets, and this most definitively has begun with the hotel sector.</p><h4>What potential is there for new office buildings that are managed in a different manner to attract the interest of institutional investors?</h4><p>The opportunity definitely lies in the ownership consolidation of the properties. We come from a culture of small property deed-based investments and sales, this meaning that the available offers do not meet the actual demand mainly in the traditional office areas in Bogotá. The new market paradigm we face demands property development that technically meets international standards. There is a lot of room to professionalize our models of investment and our management of real estate development. Corporate buildings were merely the most secure investment option for individuals in a market offering no alternatives. Now, occupants of every type, including businesses, merchants, logistics managers, and hotel managers, all look for added value, and this is the unknown territory for the traditional investors and developers and is one of the main reasons for the existence of CREA.</p><h4>What are CREA Management's main objectives?</h4><p>CREA's objective is to structure successful commercial projects, thus filling a gap in the market. We have very good builders and large funds with great provision of capital, but none is ready to develop an asset and take the commercial risk. Now, we're not talking about construction, sales, and exit—now builders have a major responsibility in the long term. Investors consider long-term viability and rent potential based on what they pay per square meter. In my experience, from an investor's perspective in Colombia, it's not easy to find someone to advise on these types of transactions. And CREA's mission is to be the best advisor in technical, commercial, and financial aspects. We need to transform the information of the market into opportunities, look for development niches, and transform it into attractive real estate products that have distinguished services and real estate structures that can get converted into destinations, transform the city, and get companies to see non-traditional office locations as an option. This is what makes real estate assets become liquid and hence transactionable.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Xerox developed its document-focused business into the comprehensive tools it offers in 2014, and what do those products and services mean for the growing Middle East?</h4><p>Xerox has always been at the forefront of innovation and advancement in the IT industry. The office of today would not be what it is without the many Xerox inventions and enhancements to help processes and capabilities. In 2014, Xerox has the most comprehensive portfolio of document-based services and solutions for diverse customer types across the major commercial and governmental sectors. It is this one-stop shop service that stands Xerox apart. More importantly, today our relevance in the wider Middle East market place is at its peak. The Middle East is a dynamic market place and our products and services are enabling customers to focus directly on their core business. Specifically, Xerox' services, products, and expertise enable workplaces, whether big or small, to simplify work processes so that they can focus on what matters more; their real business. Making processes simpler has been in our DNA since we invented the copier. Xerox believes that customers will want to add value to their business through the use of strategic IT initiatives, which we can help with. Consultancy, post-sale excellence, and the provision of management data to drive efficiency and excellence adds value. Xerox Managed Print Services (MPS) is a good example of this trend, and we are seeing significant demand for this type of high-quality offering. Xerox is also working with various governments across the Middle East to offer services that support transport infrastructure, healthcare, and financial processes. Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) is another trend that will see a significant increase, and clients will have to work with vendors on the challenges this brings to security, application development, and mobile working. This is an element of the consumerization of IT that is affecting all organizations around the world. Xerox has been working to help clients in the region with these challenges and provide users and IT professionals with the best of both worlds.</p><h4>Xerox has been in the Saudi market for over 25 years. What importance does this market still hold for Xerox?</h4><p>Saudi Arabia is part of Xerox Middle East and Africa and within the remit of Developing Markets Operations. As of today, Saudi Xerox is the single largest Middle Eastern operation by any measure of Xerox partners. It is with immense pride in the Xerox people in Saudi Arabia that I say this, because it is their hard work that allows us to say this. To put it into context, there are more than 89 countries represented in Xerox Middle East and Africa, and it is not just the results that make Saudi Xerox a leading light in this stable; it is capability, reliability, and consistency. As such, Saudi Arabia, as a market place, is considered to be an important part of Xerox operations across all developing markets, and it is a market where Xerox chooses to lead with a premium line up of services and technologies, enabling our Saudi customers to compete globally.</p><h4>As Saudi Arabia grows and the world digitalizes, how will Xerox's products assist Saudi businesses to compete domestically and internationally?</h4><p>Today, Xerox is not only a technology provider; we also offer services and IT platforms that help businesses integrate their processes. Moreover, our solutions have been developed to adapt to the rapid pace of technological advancements, both in Saudi Arabia and in the wider international environment. In today's economy, everyone is looking to cut costs. For most companies, the ongoing expense of office printing—cost-per-print, routine maintenance, and service—is an unexplored opportunity for significant, cumulative savings. Our worldwide network of certified reseller partners deliver managed print services to help large organizations and SMEs centralize the management of all their devices—including printers, copiers, and multifunction printers from multiple manufacturers. A centralized management of networked print devices through MPS can help organizations reduce outgoing costs and budgets by cutting costs on printing across organizations of all sizes, reducing energy consumption through device consolidation and using more efficient devices, freeing up IT resources for more business-critical tasks rather than installing, and supporting, and maintaining output devices. MPS helps in reducing around 50% of calls to the help desk ensuring greater productivity at the work place. It also allows people to forecast budgets accurately by setting printing and supply costs up-front. Along with our services-led approach, Xerox technology also helps workers adapt to new challenges. Over the years, while the working environment remains the same, the way people work has changed, leading to demand for better services to increase productivity and reduce workload. ConnectKey is an operating system and software for Xerox multifunction printers (MFPs). It was designed for one purpose; to simplify the way work gets done. The ConnectKey MFPs do much more than print, scan, fax, and copy. You can print from just about any device from anywhere. Documents can be scanned directly to cloud services such as Google Drive, Evernote, and Office 365 for storage and collaboration, right from the MFP touch screen. The common user interface also allows anyone in the workforce to easily connect into the company's business processes. For IT professionals, this common user interface as well as embedded security protection from McAfee allows MFPs to be managed and protected as easily as the rest of the network. The total Xerox package of service and hardware brings together the sustainable competitive advantage that organizations are looking for.</p><div class="quote">“Today, Xerox is not only a technology provider; we also offer services and IT platforms."</div><h4>How do joint ventures and local partnerships, including your historic partnership with Olayan Group, factor into your long-term strategy for growth in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>Olayan is a local and multinational organization that has been in business since 1947, and its diversified portfolio and expertise has made it a leader that many organizations aspire to be. We at Xerox have the privilege of partnering with it to ensure that this history of success and performance is brought to the Xerox brand and operations in Saudi Arabia. Xerox recognizes the value of partnering with local Middle Eastern companies of note, and Saudi Arabia is not the only place where we have joint venture companies. In other markets we choose to work with significant organizations of local standing with a strong ethos of partnership, and always with the best intentions for excellent performance with local people who understand the requirements of the region. With this approach we are confident that these partnerships will help us both grow and prosper to achieve our aspirations.</p><h4>Where do you hope to see Xerox positioned in the market in five years? What initiatives are driving you toward that goal?</h4><p>Currently, Saudi Xerox has achieved leadership positions in IDC rankings for the sale of equipment in color and production spaces. We have had significant success in offering customers our global document outsourcing services, and we continue to drive new business in our entry printer business in the Kingdom. In five years, we must protect that achievement, but also introduce new customers to the wider offerings that Xerox makes in services, new technology, and solutions, and to be recognized in the market for being a leading player in business process outsourcing. Our future success as outlined above and as an organization is contingent upon our people first and foremost. We need to continue building their skills and capabilities so we can offer our customers the best-of-breed services and technologies that we currently do. We will also continue to expand the number and quality of partner organizations who work with Xerox in the country, ensuring that customers can access solutions and services from Xerox through accredited partners, doing business with the same quality and high ethical standards that Xerox itself does. We will sustain our leadership position as a service and technology provider by advancing technologies, launching new applications, and investing in innovation to provide our clients with state-of-the-art comprehensive services that will simplify their business processes and help them compete globally. The next five years will also be a growth period for MPS within the Middle East and Africa. Many industry experts predict that MPS will continue to grow as organizations look to reduce print and the associated costs. There will be a key focus on the broadening of existing agreements to support new and existing clients with business process services and content management as the print and IT worlds continue to converge.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Saudi Arabia is a founding member OPEC and its largest producer. What role does Saudi Arabia play in OPEC's current policy objectives?</h4><p>Saudi Arabia is OPEC's largest producer, with major reserves and potential, and an experienced and highly skilled workforce educated both at home and internationally. But there is far more to Saudi Arabia's role than just its size; it is vital to OPEC's decision-making process and in helping achieve the central objective of oil market stability. In this regard, it is always looking to find positive solutions to any challenges the Organization may face, and to work constructively with all the other Members. In terms of the history of the Organization, Saudi Arabia is a founding Member, has hosted a number of OPEC Ministerial Conferences, has held the OPEC Conference Presidency on several occasions, and afforded the Organization a Secretary General in the 1960s. In addition it also hosted the Third Summit of OPEC Heads of State and Government in 2007, which concluded with a Solemn Declaration in which principles were set out to guide the future work of the Organization. Saudi Arabia has contributed much to the Organization. We respect and appreciate its support and input. And this goes for all Member Countries: each of them has a voice and their views are important to the Organization's present and future.</p><h4>Throughout the history of OPEC, how has cooperation between member states encouraged greater trade between them? What about in the Middle East specifically?</h4><p>For OPEC, in terms of overall trade between Member Countries over the past 50 plus years, this is obviously difficult to quantify. But I think I can safely say that the relationships that have evolved between countries, through their involvement with OPEC, have helped advance bilateral relations and trade ties. From the perspective of the oil sector and OPEC, over the years the Organization has brought together its Member Countries to discuss and share knowledge on various issues, such as technology, R&amp;D, investment, capacity expansion, and the environment. I certainly hope that in a small way these activities have advanced dialogue, cooperation, and trade among Members.</p><div class="quote">“For OPEC, the main focus will continue to be on trying to ensure the market is stable and balanced."</div><h4>OPEC has predicted an increase in oil demand in 2014 by over 1 million barrels per day. At the same time, it also suggests that non-OPEC countries will meet this demand increase. What does this mean for expanding OPEC production in the years ahead?</h4><p>Yes, we expect that supplies from non-OPEC producers will meet the expected global oil demand increase this year. We have recently seen an expansion in non-OPEC production, particularly in the US with tight oil. These developments are welcome—we need diversity in production. There is room for all sources of energy, and oil, in particular. However, we also need to keep our eyes on the long term and where supplies will come from. When we talk about our future, we are not just talking about the next few years. What is clear is that significant OPEC capacity expansion will be required. We expect to see the call on OPEC liquids increase by over 10 million barrels a day—to over 47 million barrels a day (bbl/d) by 2035. This is greater than the expected increase in non-OPEC liquids supply over the same period, at just under 9 million bbl/d.  Of course, OPEC continues to invest—to maintain existing capacity and add new production—to meet these future expectations. And as it has done for many decades, OPEC and its Member Countries will continue to monitor the market on a daily basis, and make sure that production and future investments are in line with how we see the market in the coming months and years.</p><h4>The majority of OPEC's members are from the high-growth Middle East region, and many Gulf nations, like Saudi Arabia, are beginning to consume significantly more oil than in the past. What is OPEC's approach, from a policy perspective, to this trend of domestic consumption?</h4><p>We have seen a number of OPEC Member Countries make statements about trying to reduce their domestic oil consumption. For example, through the utilization of natural gas and renewables for power generation, as well as the advancement of energy efficiency measures. It is clearly an important issue, one that OPEC Member Countries are looking at closely, and one in which the OPEC Secretariat has worked with its Members to analyze some of the issues through a study and workshop. Let me stress, however, that OPEC is not involved in its Member Country policy choices. How they utilize their crude oil resources is a decision for them to make.</p><h4>As the world's energy demand increase in the medium term, what are your goals for OPEC as an organization? Where can we expect to see OPEC in 2020 in terms of membership, production, and influence?</h4><p>For OPEC, the main focus will continue to be on trying to ensure the market is stable and balanced in terms of supply and demand. This means better understanding and helping overcome any future industry challenges, such as excessive market speculation and volatility, potential human resource shortages and rising costs, as well as those that today could be termed as “unknowns." This also means working, where appropriate, with other industry stakeholders. In an increasingly energy interdependent context, dialogue and cooperation can be expected to play an expanding role in the years ahead. By 2020, we should also be heading into a period where OPEC's production needs to expand significantly. It has the capacity to do this, with proven reserves in OPEC Member Countries currently totaling more than 80% of the world's total, and as I have already mentioned, it is committed to making sure investments take place to meet future demand increases. In terms of membership, I cannot predict whether we will see new Members in the future, but any oil producer that is a net exporter can apply to join the Organization. We do not actively seek new Members, but we are always ready to talk.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of the Mexican market for your company?</h4><p>At a global level, Pirelli has always had a strategy of diversification regarding its manufacturing locations. The NAFTA market has been one of the great opportunities for the company. When we made the decision to build another plant to serve the NAFTA region, we selected Mexico for a number of reasons. Geographically, it is very well situated to serve markets to the north and south. Mexico enjoys 12 free trade agreements (FTAs) with 45 countries, and this means that production can be sold in both the NAFTA region and many other markets. Mexico's population is young, and so the market has much room for growth. This is a demographic bonus, and we will have customers for a long time to come who are economically active, as well as staff for our plant. Mexico is also enjoying good growth within its education system, in particular the college and university systems. At our plant in Silao, we have a research and development group of 22 engineers, 20 of whom are Mexican, and we continue to provide our compatriots with employment in their home country. At this plant, we made an initial investment of $200 million, and we are now in the process of investing an identical sum. This is a large plant of 135,000 sqm under one roof. In 2017, when it becomes fully operation, it will employ 1,400 direct and 400 indirect employees with a total of 1,800 jobs created. In 2017, it will produce 17,000 tires daily, which amounts to 5.5 million a year. Last year, we celebrated the production of the 1 millionth tire. In 1Q2014, we celebrated the production of 2 million tires, and by November 2014 we expect to have produced 3 million tires. The numbers keep growing, and as a result we will have reached our targets by 2017.</p><h4>What are the figures regarding the development of Guanajuato?</h4><p>The factory not only contributes new jobs, but also provides for personal development. When we initiated the project, we sent about 120 people to Europe to work at our factory for 3-6 months, so they could learn the process and system, and bring that knowledge back to Mexico. We are hiring local providers to help us install equipment in the plant, the result being they have had to learn the skills to do so, boosting their professional knowledge in the process. We are constantly looking for local suppliers of required materials, so there is a considerable development of local providers. If a local provider wants to sell us something that does not meet our standards, we help them achieve those standards. We run a green plant: none of our production scrap ends up in a landfill. We recycle our water, use natural lighting to save on energy, and are constantly looking for ways to make our products more environmentally friendly. In the second investment project we are making, we have added space and equipment for the production of special green tires that assist cars in using less gasoline by reducing the rolling resistance a tire has. Gasoline consumption is an issue around the world, and anything we can do to reduce it is a benefit to society and the consumer.</p><div class="quote">“In 2015 Formula 1 will return to Mexico City, we will of course be a major sponsor of the event, and plan to use our visibility to promote road safety."</div><h4>What are your short-term expectations for the market?</h4><p>In the NAFTA region, we are growing at a double-digit pace. We have excellent contracts with auto companies that are already public knowledge. One that we are particularly proud of is our contract with the new 50th Anniversary Ford Mustang. For North America, this is an important landmark, and the special high-performance tires for that car are made in Silao. The production of the plant is generally reserved for export markets. If you think about NAFTA in terms of market size, Canada accounts for about 10%, the US 80%, and Mexico 10% of regional GDP. It is logical, therefore, for 70-90% of what we produce to be exported. We have to consider local carmakers and where they are producing. Mexico today is the biggest provider of cars for the US market. We recognize that some of the technical skills we need at the high-end aspects of our plant are not readily available, so we are in the process of launching the Instituto Piero Pirelli, in association with local and state governmental and teaching institutions. The purpose is to develop talent to work in the automotive market on the machines, hydraulic systems, and electronics. Those trained at the Instituto Piero Pirelli will work in diverse companies, not just at Pirelli, so it will ultimately benefit everyone. In addition, as a company, we have a long-standing relationship with soccer legends Inter Milan. Around the world, Pirelli has set up Inter Milan campuses, where hundreds of children from lower-income families have the chance to be trained, play soccer, and to gain a more aspirational perspective on life. Our hope is for these children to one day come to work for Pirelli. Even if they don't, one day they will be customers and their lives will been changed in some way. We have been around long enough to know exactly who we are, and moreover, we know where we want to be. We provide premium products, and use leading-edge technology to produce them. My desire is for Pirelli to be the brand of choice for consumers, the supplier of choice for distributors, and the employer of choice for our associates. If we accomplish these things, we will consider ourselves successful, and are making encouraging progress so far. Currently, we have a good managerial staff comprised of expatriates and Mexicans, although our goal is for Pirelli Mexico to be managed by Mexicans from top to bottom. We treat our employees as associates, because in the world we live in today, we choose where we want to be. If you think of your employees as associates, it opens up communication.</p><h4>Apart from the Inter Milan campus and the Piero Pirelli institute, do you have any other initiatives?</h4><p>Those are our primary corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives. I do a lot to build the brand, because I spent many years as a marketer. I know what makes a brand powerful and memorable. Pirelli's strategy is very straightforward. In 2015 Formula 1 will return to Mexico City, we will of course be a major sponsor of the event, and plan to use our visibility to promote road safety. We can also demonstrate tire technology at its limit. The fastest speed achieved last year, during Formula 1, was by a Mexican. The speed was 342 kilometers per hour, using our tires. An incredible 1.5 billion people watch Formula 1, which makes the sport an ideal marketing tool. Another part of our strategy is our calendar. This year we celebrated the 50th anniversary of the calendar, which is particularly special in that it has featured many celebrities, such as Penelope Cruz, Amy Smart, Heidi Klum, and Naomi Campbell. Meanwhile, locally we are big supporters of the growth of society through education. For the future we want people to continue taking pride in working at an institution such as Pirelli.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did Nissan become the biggest automotive exporter and investor in Mexico's automotive sector?</h4><p>Mexico was the first country where Nissan established manufacturing operations and facilities outside of Japan in 1966. Today, Nissan Mexicana is the operating global benchmark for the corporation when we look at some of the key metrics: sales volume, market share, manufacturing, the financial arm (Credi Nissan) and investment, among others. Nissan has been the sales leader in the market for 61 consecutive months, as of June 2014, when we established a 26% market share. We firmly believe that Nissan has maintained its leadership in the Mexican automotive industry primarily due to various key elements, the first being our talent in our team, a winning mindset philosophy, and our product portfolio that reflects our passion for innovation, quality, durability, and reliability. We also have top satisfaction indexes in both sales and customer services. We also have a network of dealers with more than 230 modern and efficient facilities in optimal locations, with solid geographical coverage. We have a strong financial arm through Credi Nissan, the leading financial institution in the country. We count among the leading manufacturing operations in the country, through our three plants. Nissan has been established as the top investor in the country in this decade, through two particular projects, including investment in a second plant in Aguascalientes in which we started production for the new Sentra in November 2013, incorporating the first phase of a $2 billion investment. Most recently, as of June 27, 2014, we ratified a partnership with Daimler, representing an additional investment for another plant in Aguascalientes, incorporating a $1.4 billion investment for the production of Infiniti and Mercedes-Benz vehicles.</p><h4>Nissan has opened its third production plant in the country, located in Aguascalientes. What will this new plant bring for Nissan Mexico in terms of job creation and production?</h4><p>In November 2013, Nissan inaugurated its third plant in Mexico, involving the first phase of a $2 billion manufacturing complex in Aguascalientes, Mexico. The Nissan Aguascalientes 2 plant incorporated 3,000 direct jobs to operate the plant, with an annual capacity of 175,000 units, taking Nissan's total manufacturing capacity in the country to 850,000 vehicles. The Sentra produced in this new plant is being exported mainly to the US and Brazil, along with satisfying the local demand for this vehicle, which is among the top-10 selling vehicles in the country. Most recently, the Renault-Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn and Daimler CEO Dieter Zetsche announced that both companies agreed to establish a 50-50 joint venture, the business entity that will oversee construction and operation of the new plant in Aguascalientes, the third one in the state, and fourth in the country. The new plant will be built in the immediate vicinity of the already existing Nissan plant and will have an annual capacity of 300,000 vehicles when fully ramped up. The start of production is planned for 2017 with Infiniti models. The production of Mercedes-Benz branded vehicles will follow in 2018. Daimler and Nissan will share the total investment cost for Aguascalientes of approximately $1.4 billion. The companies will add almost 5,700 jobs (including engineering, line workers, and support staff) by the time the plant reaches full capacity, expected in 2021. In addition, a high localization rate will significantly increase the Mexican supply base, while also incorporating more than 10,000 indirect jobs. These two investments confirm, just in this decade, a total figure of over $3.4 billion, while also generating almost 9,000 direct jobs, along with more than 20,000 indirect jobs.</p><div class="quote">“Mexico was the first country where Nissan established manufacturing operations and facilities outside of Japan in 1966."</div><h4>What role does innovation play at Nissan Mexico?</h4><p>Innovation is the central part of Nissan's DNA. It's proven that in Mexico our vehicles have a clear, strong reputation for quality, durability, and reliability, including six of the top-10 selling vehicles in the country, all locally produced. NissanConnect is one of the top technological innovations we have incorporated in our vehicles, a service that allows the user to synchronize applications from a smartphone, to his or her Nissan vehicle, enabling customers to stay in touch no matter where they go. We also have Nissan Safety Shield, which provides the driver with an all-around driver support system, including around-view monitor, back-up collision intervention, lane departure prevention, and distance control assist. Nissan Safety Shield monitors 360 degrees around the car for risks, offers warnings to the driver, and takes action to prevent an accident. One of the latest additions to the Safety Shield technology program is the smart rearview monitor; the world's first LCD monitor that helps provide clear rearward visibility unimpeded by traditional obstacles such as cargo, tall passengers, inclement weather, or the design of a vehicle. This technology will be incorporated into our vehicle line-up starting 2015. Nissan has been the first automotive company in the country to launch an electric vehicle this summer, the 100% electric zero emissions Nissan LEAF, after more than two years of working to establish infrastructure in various states, along with pilot taxi programs in Mexico City and Aguascalientes. We are working to expand our infrastructure in 2014 and beyond. Nissan has incorporated in Mexico the solid base and the elements that have made our zero emission strategy the most relevant around the globe, with a global market share for electric vehicles of almost 50% through 35 countries in which the LEAF is sold, with more than 120,000 satisfied customers in over two years. Among the activities that we conducted we established the world's largest electric taxi pilot program with 50 units in the city of Aguascalientes. We are also coordinating efforts with the government of Morelos to integrate soon the first electric corridor in Latin America between Mexico City and Cuernavaca.</p><h4>The automotive industry employees 500,000 people in Mexico and represents approximately 4% of GDP. What will 2014 bring for Nissan Mexico?</h4><p>In 2013, Nissan established a new sales milestone in the country with over 267,000 units sold. In 2014 we are looking forward to surpass this figure, even with an industry that has shown a contraction in this first semester. Along with that, our manufacturing strategy is considering a new milestone of 800,000 units for this year. The base to continue with this growth is well established in the top talent we have in a team of more than 14,500 employees, our leadership mentality, a solid financial arm, customer satisfaction, and preference for our vehicles, along with the introduction of products with top innovation in our line-up such as the Nissan LEAF and Nissan Xtrail, along with consolidating stronger sales of products with higher growth potential like Nissan Versa (the second best-selling vehicle in the country), Sentra and Altima (integrating new technologies and connectivity), Pathfinder (the new favorite crossover for the Mexican public), and Nissan NOTE, among others. Through the recent investment announcement in partnership with Daimler, we look forward to the day in which Nissan will produce over 1 million vehicles in the country.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

Could you evaluate the role this economic engine is playing?</h4><p>This is the fastest route for Colombia to keep growing and opening doors to investors keen on the opportunities available in an emerging market. Thanks to government strategy, investments, and innovation in its systems, cities and education programs have demonstrated to other nations the potential and stability this country offers. Medellí­n was recently named the Most Innovative City in the world as the Wall Street Journal identified Colombia as a target for significant investor groups from the US and other countries interested in the output of its digital business entrepreneurs.</p><h4>How important is your sector in contributing toward the reduction of unemployment and poverty, and what role do you believe it could have in a potential post-conflict scenario?</h4><p>In Colombia, more than 80% of new businesses disappear during the first five years and an average of 90% will not survive more than 10 years. This data clearly highlights a weakness in business management. Many businesses simply do not comprehend how to get business through the door, which is precisely where we come in by offering products to help local businesses grow, while also fortifying our users' marketing efforts. We do this though events, courses, and content exclusive to all MyLocal users. We don't want to just sell, but we also want to guide and help sustain local businesses.</p><h4>You founded MyLocal in Spain in December of 2013, after a successful career in leading technology, media, and consumer companies such as Fox Mobile, Panda Security, Orange, Ericsson, and SproutLoud Media Networks. What success has MyLocal had in Spain and how did your previous experience prepare you to launch this company?</h4><p>Every company has taught me something about internet usage and behavior. I've experienced the growth and decay of online business models such as mobile subscriptions, where abruptly a government may shut down an entire country's operations. On the other hand, I have thoroughly studied the power of local marketing and how it helps businesses to grow, thereby contributing to the broader local market. The combination of good and bad practices along with massive data from many countries has allowed me to design a service that fits the objectives of all local businesses. Spain's situation has been a perfect start for MyLocal since there was a challenge with variables such as a difficult market, a tight economy, and extremely low confidence reflected in all businesses and professional services buffeted by the global economic crisis. Our product was well received by local business owners. Factors such as pricing, results, and the importance of a technology innovative solution helped local businesses improve the sales and services provided to their clients.</p><div class="quote">“Every company has taught me something about internet usage and behavior."</div><h4>In which of your markets do you foresee the greatest potential, the US, Latin America, or Europe?</h4><p>The answer is definitely Latin America, where I strongly believe MyLocal will, in a tangible way, help thousands of local business owners, managers, and professionals not only obtain results, but also develop their skills and knowledge of local marketing.</p><h4>MyLocal selected Medellí­n as the address of its first office in Latin America. What was the thinking behind this?</h4><p>Medellí­n is a great example in the arena of innovation and transformation. This city is not only beautiful, but also has the right attitude. Every candidate who applied to any of our job openings showed a great attitude in terms of personal growth, and a love for and commitment to their city and country. I love working with Colombians and every member of our company proves on a daily basis how important it is for them to make things work since they understand how this will positively affect their families, city, and country in terms of growth and prosperity.</p><h4>Could you briefly describe the Colombian market?</h4><p>The Colombian market is complex but extremely open to new products, with companies willing to offer services that are results-oriented and in an attractive price range. This is why MyLocal clients are extremely satisfied and loyal to the brand. Our online service offers a tangible value that is focused on results and a long-term relationship accompanied by a range of exclusive and additional material to develop local business owners' and manager's skills in local marketing. The idea is that they are equipped to continue developing their business once our service has been fulfilled.</p><h4>Looking ahead, could you describe the range of MyLocal services that you expect to generate the most demand?</h4><p>We focus mainly on one goal with our clients, which is to expose their business in as many digital environments as possible to increase the opportunity of attracting new customers out of the thousands of customers that perform searches related to their geographic location. Around this goal arise additional needs that increase value for our users and alignment with our goal. Anything related to local marketing can turn into a product of value for local businesses. This involves the use of local advertising, radio, and newspapers with tracking technology and realistic pricing for our smaller clients. I think services such as content generation for social media along with reputation management for business reviews have the capacity to generate huge demand and advances within our innovation and design/R&amp;D division.</p><h4>How many people do you employ worldwide and how do you invest in human talent?</h4><p>We currently have over 75 employees worldwide, but monthly growth is at roughly 10%. Talent is the most important consideration for us, right after our clients' needs. We sponsor health programs for our employees and provide free time during the week for people to develop themselves, or work on personal projects.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In a highly specialized industry, labor represents an important part of success. How does your human capital policy attract the expertise required to support your operations?</h4><p>When we talk about human resources, we talk about our own business. We have to look at what differentiates one operator from another, in the sense that the same regulation is applied to all by civil aviation, but it doesn't make a big difference except in the caliber of the people that you use to carry out the task. Therefore, we have been very conscious of the fact that we are a service provider. Our focus and strategy has developed and evolved on providing quality services to our clients, meaning to achieve this we have to attract, train, and retrain human capital, which is what we do now. The main focus of this organization is on the production side, people who work on the anchor floor, engineers, and pilots, to make sure we will always have the best. Therefore, we provide them a decent way of living. To achieve this objective, we always try to look at what is important to the employee. We look at logistics support. Graduates travel in and out and they work from six to six. As a part of our plan, Abu Dhabi is becoming a busy city, and we offer our own accommodation for employee families. We started providing accommodation for our single workers, but now we are moving our plan toward employee families as well. This will provide them with peace of mind when it comes to variables. We don't want our staff to suffer. Therefore, we try to maximize what we can do for them. The other part of the plan is to ensure that our employees are aware of their job, what they want to do, and when they need to deliver. Basically, this is our human resources policy, and I think over the years it has proven to be a great strategy, as we have had some people with us for more than 25 years.</p><h4>One of the services that you provide is training. You do it internally but also to support your customer base. To which type of institutions do you provide training?</h4><p>We provide different services that we were able to sponsor outside Abu Dhabi. We are looking for clients who have been in our position at some stage, where they need somebody to come with experience to support them as they grow their business. This has created an opportunity abroad because we are not looking for giants or established institutions, because they are most likely in the same position as we are. We are looking for somebody who wants to start a new business, but doesn't know how to grow. We will go there and support them, and we have great examples. We were able to grow the business of a small Brazilian operator, who we started a partnership with five years back. After five years, we could pull back and let it go its own way. We are happy that we were able to support it. It is not a specific training course, just training for the engineers and pilots, but we also transfer know-how.</p><div class="quote">“Offshore is our bread and butter; this is what we have done for years."</div><h4>The largest share of your business is to support the offshore oil industry. In which other sectors are you looking to expand?</h4><p>Offshore is our bread and butter; this is what we have done for years. When it comes to other sectors, we started with search and rescue, and we gained a significant amount of experience in Saudi Arabia with the Red Crescent. Actually, it is been excellent being part of its program because it was just starting up, and we started with it. It was a challenging experience, because we were dealing with clients that wanted to start a new business in a new area with new rules and regulations, and they were trying to do it independently. This kind of environment has created a quality team with a high amount of knowledge in the business. After three years, we started to focus in-house, and we were able to win a similar activity with an oil company in the UAE by providing medical support. Abu Dhabi Aviation partners with specialists who provide medical care; we provide the aircraft, and this partnership provides the ideal solution for our clients. I believe this is a good strategy, and we are expanding the business and providing more training courses. We built our own simulator, which will cover the training needs of all our clients in the UAE and the MENA region. Clients in the Middle East don't need to go to Europe for training anymore. To expand this business, we have a separate building just for the simulator, and we are trying to develop it to be an international hub for helicopter training. This will mean that different platforms, aircraft, and manufacturers can come here and we will be able to offer training to many clients. Additionally, we do fire fighting courses in Europe, seismic work, VIP transfers, filming, and lifting. For example, to celebrate 100 years of Aston Martin in 2013, we lifted an Aston Martin Vanquish to the top of the Burj Al Arab in Dubai.</p><h4>What is the vision of Abu Dhabi and the aerospace sector in the long term?</h4><p>If I look back over the last five years, I think Abu Dhabi has made a major statement in the aviation industry as a whole, whether it is from Etihad Airways or other related industries. In my opinion, Etihad Airways has performed a kind of miracle over the last decade. I have been in this industry for over 25 years, and I am very impressed with what it has done. Abu Dhabi has its own position and statement when we come to aviation; therefore, we will see more expansion when it comes to number of flights in and out of Abu Dhabi. We will also see more airlines from here flying to new destinations. This is happening so rapidly, but in reality it is something we never expected. Aviation is an economic enabler.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What benefits Palm Utilities bring to Empower and the market?</h4><p>Palm Utilities was an established business, but we found that it was not managed properly. Good management is key in any business. Look at the aviation industry, for example. Emirates Airlines started in 1985 with a capital of $2 million and two hired aircraft. Today, it has a huge capacity. We plan to do the same, and are confident that we can turn it around. And, over the next few months, we believe we will manage that.</p><h4>You also took on $600 million and spent $500 million on this acquisition. Will you use the remaining $100 million for investment in new projects?</h4><p>We do have projects and a plan. We covered the price of the acquisition, so the remaining money can be spent correcting the business. Empower is building two pontoons in Business Bay that will cost quite a lot of money. We are paying for them from the revenues and investor finances. It will generate cash through its operations. This is a continuous process. We need a certain level of debt in order to grow, whether at a personal or a business level. You do not take that money to spend on something fancy, as you are taking it to develop your business. The minute we stop growing is the minute we start stagnating. If you keep investing, then you are going to increase the size of your business over time.</p><div class="quote">“Dubai is searching for green solutions to reduce the Emirate's carbon footprint and to focus on the push toward clean energy."</div><h4>Will this acquisition represent the creation of the largest district cooling service provider company in the world?</h4><p>I am a member of the International District Energy Association (IDEA), the largest and most authenticated body of district energy, based in the US, which has over 1,700 members in 25 countries that deal with district energy issues. The total tonnage register for the next-largest company shows 700,000 tons of air-conditioned distance cooling units. Empower has 1 million air-conditioned distance cooling units, so we are the largest by far.</p><h4>What does district cooling bring to Dubai?</h4><p>Dubai is searching for green solutions to reduce the Emirate's carbon footprint and to focus on the push toward clean energy. District cooling is a key part of this process. You never know what will happen in 10 years, but you do know about the next two or three years, and district cooling is a part of that future.</p><h4>What improvements are you arranging in the cooling sector to help the environment?</h4><p>On the environmental front, we have found a solution in using treated sewage water instead of potable water for district cooling. At some of our plants, we recycle the water and put it back into the system. We save a lot on potable water, while at the same time achieving clean and environmentally friendly air conditioning that reduces the city's carbon footprint.</p><h4>What is your strategy or sustainable model for Empower in 2014?</h4><p>Empower has to continue on the same path it has followed for a decade, by working hard and focusing on the future. For 2014, I assume that our turnover will jump to $1.4 billion or $1.5 billion, and I intend to boost my profit in double-digit terms. We will be repaying some of the debts we have on our books—settling around $100 million over 2014—and at the same time we have started paying dividends to our shareholders.</p><h4>To what extent has Empower improved its market share in the UAE and Dubai following the acquisition of Palm Utilities from Istithmar World?</h4><p>After the acquisition, we hold 70% of the market in Dubai alone. In the UAE, we have about 60%. It is important to stabilize the market. So, if we fix prices, then all of the other companies will have to compete with us. We want to set the benchmark and act as the main driver of the industry in the UAE in a way that benefits the government, our investors, and our clients.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In 1997, Panama Ports Company began implementing an infrastructure for new world-trade operations. What other major milestones has the company achieved since entering the market in that year?</h4><p>We certainly believe that we have done nothing less than open a gateway for container transport on the Pacific side of the Panama Canal. We are also pleased to be the largest container operator in the country, operating more than 3.6 million TEUs in total in 2013, and directly employing over 4,000 people. Over the past 17 years we have invested over $800 million, and in 2014 we are seeing growth rates of 5% to 7%.</p><h4>What was Hutchison's impetus for entering the Panamanian market?</h4><p>The Panama Canal is a prime tool that the shipping industry has to its advantage. The connectivity that it provides for the trans-Pacific and trans-Atlantic trades, connecting the east and west coast of the US, as well as the east and west coast of South and Central America, is a tremendous asset. Most of the world was experiencing port privatization 17 years ago. Hutchison Ports Holding (HPH), the largest container operator in the world, saw the opportunity to invest in Panama since the government was undergoing the privatization process of a port concession, which represented an opportunity to develop container terminals at both ends of the canal. Today, HPH Panama is considered the most important port operator in the country. With operations on both ends of the canal, a major initiative for the company is to further assist in this connectivity in order to develop a more efficient manner for crossing the canal. This, in turn, will reinforce the process to logistically make Panama the best network in the world.</p><div class="quote">“Our operations in Panama, at the Port of Balboa and the Port of Cristobal, are both equally important for us."</div><h4>Panama Ports Company has operations on both sides of the canal, in the ports of Balboa and Cristobal. Which is the most important factor for the company's activities?</h4><p>Our operations in Panama, at the Port of Balboa and the Port of Cristobal, are both equally important for us. We envision a system that utilizes diverse modes of transportation, such as barges, trucks, and rail to provide a high-value service structure to fulfil our client's needs. The Hutchison portfolio is very solid with an extensive history in Asia, where some of the largest ports are located. The company operates 52 ports in over 26 countries and strategic cities such as Rotterdam, Felixstowe, and Barcelona; nonetheless, Panama has two of the most important ports for the group.</p><h4>What is your future plan for expansion?</h4><p>We are currently reengineering our container operations, which represent a solid business with room for further development. We will therefore have greater capacities and new licensing ideas, similar to what we have implemented in other countries, such as automation; between the two ports we handle about 3.5 million TEUs per year, but have the capacity to reach a total  of 6.5 million TEUs per year. We are also focusing greater efforts in areas such as automobiles, general cargo, agricultural grain, and minerals. We have considerable capacity available in the Atlantic, an area that has not been fully developed, and are currently working on a master plan to do so.</p><h4>What are the key routes for your operations?</h4><p>The trans-Pacific route is the most important, connecting Asia to the west and east coast of South America. On the other side, there is the trans-Atlantic route from Europe to the east coast of North and South America. A smaller portion is destined for the Caribbean and the west coast of South America.</p><h4>What are your financial expectations for 2014, and which main challenges do you anticipate facing over the next few years?</h4><p>Containers depend extensively on trade, which we expect to steadily grow. For example, 2009 and 2011 were years where global trade dropped and immediately impacted shipping lines. Survival in the shipping industry at that time depended on reduced costs, which has consequently resulted in the rapid increase of ship sizes over recent years. We invested in cranes that normally would last for 15 years, but were obsolete within five years due to the fact that ship sizes grew so rapidly. Although we do not see triple-E class vessels coming through Panama, we will eventually see larger vessels coming through such as 12,000 to 15,000 TEUs in capacity, which requires additional infrastructure. Approximately 17 years ago when we started, the largest vessel was around 5,000 TEUs, but today are closer to 20,000 TEUs. Meanwhile, the longest ships were less than 200 meters, and have now been replaced by those of 360 meters in length. Ships of that magnitude affect your business strategy and force you to make higher investments.</p><h4>Panama is now signing numerous free trade agreements (FTAs) like the one signed with Mexico in April, which will make it possible for Panama to participate in the Pacific Alliance. What impact would this union have on your business activities?</h4><p>For Panama it will undoubtedly be beneficial, although for us it will have a limited benefit. This alliance is designed to increase and foster international trade. For our ports, the majority of business involves transhipments, with only 5% of local cargo going through Panama. Global trade is much more important for our business, where China plays a very important role.</p><h4>What will be the impact of the Panama Canal expansion at your company?</h4><p>It will have a major impact because of the increased container (trade) volume. Although our ports already have the capacity to handle vessels of up to 15,000 TEUs, it is very probable that a good amount of these vessels, which nowadays aren't able to cross the canal, will eventually be able to cross, reducing the amount of containers operated in the ports.</p><h4>As a leading company in the world, how do you evaluate the level of competition in Panama, given its status as a logistics hub?</h4><p>In Panama we have around five competitors in the country, which results in quite a competitive market. Additionally, shipping lines can vary transhipment operations very easily.</p><h4>How do you evaluate the level of port infrastructure in Panama?</h4><p>The port infrastructure in Panama is excellent. We are prepared to receive vessels of 15,000 TEUs and our ports are equipped with the newest Super Post-Panamax cranes on both sides of the canal. The current capacity in Panama is over 10 million TEUs and the total throughput in the country is approximately 7 million containers.</p><h4>What are your thoughts on the concept of Panama becoming the “Singapore of the Americas?"</h4><p>It is an excellent time for Panama to assume the role of logistics hub for the Americas, if not the world. The high demand and traffic of vessels and aircraft gives Panama an incredible opportunity to literally connect your business with any part of the world.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main strengths of the Colombian construction sector?</h4><p>As a whole, the sector foresaw the current boom ahead of time, and that has enabled us to prepare ourselves for this moment. In particular, we were ready for the increasing arrival of foreign companies in the country. There have been already several large projects developed in the sector, but I believe the real boom is yet to come.</p><h4>How are the public and private sectors working toward the development of the infrastructure sector in Colombia?</h4><p>Public-private partnerships (PPPs) are great tools for boosting cooperation between both sectors, contributing to the faster development of the infrastructure sector. SAINC S.A. currently participates in nine different PPPs in the construction of aqueducts and roads. We can say that there are over 250 ongoing PPPs in Colombia at present, and our company is set to increase its project portfolio as a result of this model of construction.</p><div class="quote">“When starting operations in any market, you need strong growth to properly take off from the beginning."</div><h4>How can the sector advance toward an increased level of professionalization among its human resources?</h4><p>Keeping in mind current employment figures that show that the construction sector is the largest employer of all the economic sectors, with over 1.2 million people, the sector's capacity to generate employment opportunities should grow by five fold over the coming five years. SAINC S.A. employs around 1,500 people today, and we plan to reach 10,000 within five years.</p><h4>Why was your company rebranded 20 years ago?</h4><p>The company was established in 1976 under the name Otero, Tafur y Duran Ltda, and I was the first employee of the company. After five years of operations, the company was experiencing some serious challenges, and I proposed that I take over from the three founders of the firm to run it. I took over along with two relatives. The company has been slowly but gradually evolving ever since then.</p><h4>What were the main challenges you had to face during this period of time?</h4><p>The sector experienced a considerable crisis around 15 years ago, and we were only one step away from closing down the company; we literally had no business activity. However, the US Mining Institution contracted us to develop a number of projects in Colombia, and this changed everything. It helped us to maintain our activity during the years of crisis, and pushed us to develop infrastructure projects in other regions of the country, and ever since we have been growing. SAINC S.A. has developed many projects across the country.</p><h4>What have been the main projects you developed in Cali?</h4><p>We have had a great amount of projects in the city of Cali and its surroundings. Some of these include: buildings for the most important universities, Pontí­ficia Universidad Javeriana, Icesi University, and San Buenaventura University; buildings for three major banks, Banco de Occidente, Bancolombia, and Banco de Bogota; the most important shopping centers, Chipichape, Unicentro, Cosmocentro, Premier Limonar, and most La 14 branches; two of the most important hospitals in the city, Hospital Imbanaco and Fundación Valle del Lili; one of the major avenues in Cali, Avenida Quinta, as well as the Cali-Yumbo Highway. Nationally, we have completed many projects as well. Among these are: the tunnels for the deviation of the Cauca River in Ituango-Antioquia, the large shopping mall La Primavera in Villavicencio, the building for the Colombian Chamber of Infrastructure (CCI) in Medellí­n and the building for the Fiscalí­a General de La Nación. We are about to start developing the Urban Renewal Plan “El Pedregal," and a development project called America Centro Mundial de Negocios in Bogotá D.C.</p><h4>Since the company expanded its activities to Peru in 2013, could you tell us a bit more about the internationalization process SAINC S.A. has been experiencing?</h4><p>When starting operations in any market, you need strong growth to properly take off from the beginning. That is what we did in Peru, where we secured the construction of three different projects. The three contracts we closed in Peru are large in size and scope. For the moment, we want to strengthen our position in Peru, and after that we will look into moving to another neighboring country. The Bolivian authorities have already shown interest in us developing certain projects there.</p><h4>What role could companies like SAINC S.A. play in a post-conflict Colombia?</h4><p>Peace would undoubtedly act to further boost the development and growth of Colombia. SAINC S.A. is willing to fully support the peace agreements and give everything possible to make such agreements last. Everybody will benefit from peace in the country, and we are set to contribute in whatever form is deemed necessary.</p><h4>What have you learned from your vast experience in the sector?</h4><p>There are three main qualities that any constructor should always look out for in projects. Quality comes first, followed by always carrying out the promises that have been made. These are two aspects of the job in which SAINC S.A. excels. Profitability must also be kept in mind. When it comes to development, it is important to understand the requirements and demands of the market, and ensure you have enough flexibility to adapt to a changing market.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Broad Strategy]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[broad-strategy]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why did the Council of Ministers establish the Oman Broadband Company?</h4><p>Oman is facing many challenges when it comes to geography and population distribution. Oman has a population of 10 people per square kilometer, which is very low compared to other regional countries. That means that any infrastructure projects that you carry out will only serve a few people at a high infrastructure cost against a low return on investment. That makes it difficult for the telecommunications operators or for the private sector to invest as the commercial justification is simply not there. As a consequence, Oman has been experiencing significant growth when it comes to mobile broadband; however, we are lagging behind when it comes to fixed broadband penetration. We are the second country in the Gulf in terms of mobile penetration, while we are the last when it comes to fixed broadband. Mobile broadband cannot take us further, because it does not have enough capacity to accommodate the growth in bandwidth demand; consequently, the focus on fixed infrastructure is a must. Somebody has to take care of it. Of course, it won't be the service providers, because it does not reflect a good commercial investment for them, so the only other viable option is for the government to support the investment in order to enable this much needed connectivity for the benefit of everybody in Oman. The government would like to achieve open access to telecommunications infrastructure for both current and future operators, with equivalence in access and transparent pricing. Having this infrastructure funded and owned by the government makes it easier for the operators to focus on competing and investing in high-quality internet and other services. These reasons encouraged the Council of Ministers to approve the national broadband strategy, which entailed establishing a national broadband company. The national broadband strategy has three pillars. The first pillar is related to the changes needed in the regulatory framework to enable and stimulate the investment in broadband-related infrastructure and services. This is related more to the Ministry of Transport and Communications and the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority. The second pillar is stimulating the demand for broadband, and this is mainly related to stimulating demand and encouraging e-services. The third pillar is to enhance the broadband infrastructure and make it more affordable, and this represents the main goal and focus of the Oman Broadband Company.</p><h4>What will be the impact of consolidated broadband infrastructure on Oman's economy?</h4><p>It has been proven worldwide that any growth in fixed broadband reflects a direct impact on GDP. Statistics say that the GDP of developing countries grew by 1.38 percentage points for each 10% increase in national broadband penetration. This is the direct impact on the economy, but there are other benefits of having more widespread broadband, one of them being the creation of a knowledge-based economy. We want to create job opportunities in the technology and ICT sectors, and employ graduates. We will also assist in the creation of a platform for electronic services and the development of the content- and cloud-based service sectors. The new broadband infrastructure linked with Oman's strategic geographical position and the favorable access to international internet gateways creates opportunity for elevating Oman to become a key internet and hosting hub in the region. This in itself has fundamental implications for Oman's economy and international recognition.</p><div class="quote">“It has been proven worldwide that any growth in fixed broadband reflects a direct impact on GDP."</div><h4>Health and education are pivotal focuses of the government. How will the enhanced broadband network enhance these two important sectors?</h4><p>Education and health are the most important clients when it comes to electronic services. The Ministry of Education runs an e-education portal, although it has been suffering from low bandwidth. The plan is to focus on schools, especially in rural areas, and on hospitals and medical facilities that are scattered all over the country. At the same, time high-speed connectivity to Omani households will unlock the possibilities of some health services, such as remote patient monitoring. The same applies for remote learning and access to global scientific content in the education sector.</p><h4>What kind of technology will be applied to the development of broadband in the Sultanate?</h4><p>We are trying to implement the latest technologies when it comes to fiber optics. The two current operators have solid infrastructure when it comes to fixed broadband; however, it is dependent mostly on copper or fixed wireless technology. Therefore, the deployed technology has limitations in terms of coverage and speed upgrades. A few years back, the government used the opportunity and decided to lay fiber alongside wastewater network projects in Muscat. This strategic decision means that we are not starting from ground zero; we are starting with around 20% coverage of fiber optics in Muscat. Therefore, the immediate task and opportunity is to enable the operators to use the existing fiber optics. It will be operational from 2015, and will be offered as a wholesale service for all licensed operators to be able to offer fiber broadband services to their customer base in Muscat. In general, the Oman Broadband Company has three main plans when it comes to the implementation of broadband. These plans will run in parallel to expand the reachability and accelerate the rollout of broadband across the Sultanate. The first one is for the Muscat region, where as mentioned we will be commercializing the existent fiber of Haya Water after transferring it to Oman Broadband Company and then expanding the rollout to cover about 90% of Muscat by 2021. The second plan focuses on the urban regions lying outside Muscat where, due to the lower demand and the geographical spread, we are to steadily deploy fiber until 2030. Again, in order to do this we are to align with other utility projects across the country, therefore lowering the civil works cost of the fiber deployment program.  In the interim period until the fiber reaches these areas, we are to support the operators in delivering mobile broadband by providing backhaul connectivity to their sites and supporting the deployment of new telecoms towers. The third plan is for the rural areas that are currently not covered. We are working with the operators to reach all areas by satellite or wireless, and to provide basic broadband services. We build the backbone infrastructure, and the operators come in and offer their services.</p><h4>A skilled workforce will be required to build such important infrastructure. What will be the Omanization level of the company?</h4><p>When it comes to human resources in Oman, especially in ICT, we have many universities providing good quality graduates in this sector. I don't think we will be facing a problem in having skilled people in managing and operating this new infrastructure. I think we will be facing another problem, which is finding enough skilled subcontractors to work on our projects when it comes to the initial roll out of fiber optics all over Oman. Most of the big companies are focusing on Muscat, but we need to support implementation and maintenance in other places, which can only be served by local people. Having recognized this issue from the very beginning, the Oman Broadband Company will be supporting the training plans of skilled technical resources and SMEs in Oman that could effectively deploy the network in different regions.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Having opened its doors in 2009, Barwa Bank has already made a real impact by realizing substantial growth rates every year. What are the main forces behind this rapid growth?</h4><p>It was our decision to choose service as a point of competition. We really have the desire to make the bank revolve around the customers. We focus on understanding and catering to our clients' needs, ensuring the best-in-class service possible, and offering tailor-made services that satisfy those needs. We understand that the mass-market network for banking is already well provided for, but we feel that there is a space for a focused bank that looks at service for a selective customer base, and clearly our clients agree. In 2013, we maintained our title of fastest growing bank in Qatar in terms of profitability and also in terms of asset growth. Another advantage we have is the way we operate. We have a light hierarchy, which enables us to move quickly when it comes to decision-making and execution. That flexibility makes our business model unique in many ways.</p><h4>What is the profile of Barwa Bank's customers and clients?</h4><p>The majority of our customers are corporate, which has been our main catalyst for growth over the last five years. We've also been extremely busy on the retail banking side, expanding our branch network and experiencing continuous growth in the number of relationships, accounts, and business activity as a result. Although we are a relatively new and small bank, we've established ourselves in the market in a short period of time, and we're proud to have the reputation of punching above our weight. When it comes to private banking, our focus is on high-income earners.</p><h4>In Barwa Bank's assessment of 2013 it was mentioned that the bank had significantly matured due to the fact that it now has a balanced income profile. What are the specific elements that indicate this evolution?</h4><p>A balanced income profile is one of the targets that we had set for ourselves. We wanted a balanced portfolio so that we weren't particularly exposed or reliant on any particular sector, such as, for example, real estate. This is a result of our strategy to diversify and grow various business units. We've also developed our debt market capabilities and have established a leading status in sukuk transactions. I also believe that the various cross-selling concept on its own and between the various divisions within the bank and the investment-banking subsidiary, The First Investor, will naturally allow us to have a balanced portfolio. This became a reality in 2013, spurred on by tremendous growth in assets and our bottom-line profitability.</p><div class="quote">“The majority of our customers are corporate, which has been our main catalyst for growth over the last five years."</div><h4>The sukuk market in Qatar is likely to continue to grow due to big infrastructure projects in the run up to the 2022 FIFA World Cup. How does this development feature in the growth strategy of the bank?</h4><p>The sukuk market is an important area of growth for us. Since our inception, we've worked extensively on building a qualified team that can compete in this sector. We have held several joint lead management positions for a number of sukuks, namely the State of Qatar sukuk, followed by the Republic of Turkey sukuk in 2012, which is a testament to our competence and expertise domestically and internationally. The capital markets business is very much a credentials business, and being involved in such high-profile transactions has the virtue of attracting new business. We're confident that we'll continue to play an increased role in future sukuk issuance. When it comes to sukuk, we are particularly proud to have set and launched the first sukuk trading platform in Qatar.</p><h4>Barwa Bank is involved in a wide range of projects through its investment bank subsidiary The First Investor. In which specific sectors here in Qatar do you see potential for investments?</h4><p>In terms of The First Investor, in which we own a 100% stake, we have an advantage in the market with our ability to provide a one-stop solution to our customer base. Not only are we able to cater to their requests on the banking side, but we can also cater to their investment needs through The First Investor, be it asset management, real estate advisory, or general investment banking advisory. We can provide tailor-made exposure to equities, real estate, and private equity in Qatar and the region. In Qatar, we're proud of being the only investment bank to have invested in the education sector. We're funding the development of schools in Qatar, working in partnership with companies like Qatar Insurance Company and GEMS. We remain keen on the education sector, as well as the healthcare sector, and we expect to be more in these fields going forward.</p><h4>To what degree is your staff Qatarized, and what is your strategy to ensuring that you attract and retain skilled employees?</h4><p>We're proud to have been able to assemble a skilled managerial team that brings energy, enthusiasm, and ambition to the office every day. We have bright Qatari talent working to contribute to the growth and development of their country and the financial sector, and we're committed to giving them continuous support to help them develop their skills and reach their future goals across our various departments. We also have ongoing internships with universities to introduce new students to various specialty areas in banking and help attract talents who can continue to develop their careers with Barwa Bank Group. We are a firm believer in having a combination of Qatari talent and also non-Qatari talent working hand-in-hand to fulfill our bank and our country's vision.</p><h4>The Qatar Exchange went from being a frontier market to being considered as an emerging market in 2014. What does this mean for Qatar's financial sector and the economy as a whole?</h4><p>We're very excited and happy for the acknowledgement of the many achievements of the financial sector in Qatar. It's the result of years of hard work and the clear strategy laid out by our financial sector regulators and executed by all financial institutions in the country, backed by a strong economic environment at the state level. This acknowledgement will definitely serve to increase the already huge appetite of investors and businesses to enter the Qatari market and will further cement Qatar's position as a regional financial center. We at Barwa Bank are extremely excited about this, and expect to see an increase in business activity as a result.</p><h4>The financial sector has become one of the main driving forces of the Qatari economy besides the energy sector. What is your outlook for this sector, and what role will there be for Islamic banking?</h4><p>The outlook is very positive for the financial sector. The general business and investment authorities are very supportive regulators, and they've worked hard to ensure that Qatar's financial sector has a clear and focused strategy. We believe that has contributed to Qatar becoming a financial hub in the region. We're very pleased to be operating in an environment with consistently positive growth figures and forecasts, and we expect to see a continuation in growth and prosperity. When it comes to Islamic banking, we see that it has gained in popularity, starting with retail, where individuals prefer to have their activities conducted in a sharia-compliant manner. That has gradually worked its way up to the corporate and even government levels. We expect to see a continuation of that trend, and at the same time we need to ensure that we continue to develop a customer experience that is not only in line with conventional banking, but also goes beyond it. We would like to work toward ensuring that sharia-compliant banking is superior to conventional banking.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You are the first Saudia affiliate to launch an IPO. Could you talk about the results of this process and the strategy that has produced it?</h4><p>We had a fantastic IPO and have experienced significant development in our share price over the past two years. A share price always represents a market assumption of the future development of the company. We believe that we have a solid strategy that has convinced our investors of Saudi Airlines Catering's value. Today, we are an in-flight catering company. We generate about 80% of our total revenues from the airline business. When I joined the company in 2012, we produced a top-level strategic review and worked out a five-year growth plan. The main components of the growth plan are all factors of the KSA airline market, including Saudi Airlines' aggressive fleet and passenger development plans, the in- vestments of the General Authority of Civil Aviation (GACA) in airport facilities, and our diversification strategy. We were proud to announce in early 2014 that we renewed our exclusive contract with Saudi Airlines to the end of 2019. Besides the airline business, we want to expand our activities in our Support Services Division, which includes business and industry catering, remote site and camp management, the industrial laundry business, and our catering activities for Hajj and Umrah pilgrims. Our strategic partnership with Newrest offers Saudi Airlines Catering both the expertise and corporate reach to back and support our diversification, ensuring such an activity is supported by a leading global service organization.</p><h4>How do you plan to maintain your market share as the country liberalizes?</h4><p>Today, we have an estimated inflight catering market share of 98%; however, we know that this kind of monopoly position will not last forever. Our 2017 growth plan includes the assumption that an inter-national in-flight caterer will enter the Saudi market. We simply have to continue to provide high-quality services in competitive conditions—then we don't have to be afraid of any competition. Currently, we do not do much business with other Middle Eastern airlines, because when they fly from their hubs into Saudi Arabia, they practice back-catering, meaning they bring the meals for their back flights with them. This is the industry standard for flights up to about three hours and also Saudia's common practice; however, as soon as foreign airlines start domestic operations, their aircraft will stay over- night in the Kingdom, and consequently will need a local catering service provider. Being the number one in-flight catering service provider in Saudi Arabia, I am confident to be able to establish a fruitful co- operation with any airline that enters the domestic market.</p><div class="quote">“We simply have to continue to provide high-quality services in competitive conditions."</div><h4>How do you expect the government's infra- structure investment will impact the long-term aspect of your business?</h4><p>One major growth factor for our in-flight division is the huge airport infrastructure investments of the GACA. It plans to more than double the capacity of Riyadh's air- port, increasing passenger numbers from 15.3 million in 2012 to 35.5 million in 2017. Another project is the new airport in Medinah, increasing passenger numbers from 3.6 million in 2012 to 12 million in 2015. And of course the new airport in Jeddah is also significant, increasing passenger numbers from 23.6 million in 2012 to 30 million in 2015 (Stage I) and up to 80 million in Stage III by 2035. In addition, there are plenty of expansion projects ongoing for smaller airports, such as Jizan, Abha, and Qasim, to name a few. All these expansion projects will massively drive the growth of our company.</p><h4>How will you meet the growing demand?</h4><p>We are in a constant process of adapting our resources to future market demands. We are constructing a kitchen facility at the new airport in Medinah; two years ago we opened a state-of-the-art central production unit in Riyadh with a capacity of 18 million meals. This production facility will double its capacity by just adding two production tunnels. We are convinced we are ready to cope with the huge growth rates the Kingdom provides us in our business activities.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main achievements of Abu Dhabi National Tanker Co (ADNATCO) and National Gas Shipping Company (NGSCO) in the petroleum sector, and what role did the companies play in developing the Emirate of Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>We primarily serve Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) and its group of companies; however, as a well-positioned and growing regional maritime operator, we also contribute to the trade growth of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. Trading with a diversified fleet of ships, which includes LNG carriers, bulk carriers, chemical and products tankers, and container ships, provides us the opportunity to extend our services to the different business sectors of the Emirate. Our vessels carry LNG from Das Island in the Arabian Gulf to Japan, while ADNATCO is involved in worldwide transportation of hydrocarbon products that are produced by ADNOC Group companies.</p><h4>In 2011, the company acquired over 15 new vessels. How are ADNATCO and NGSCO evolving, and what are the expansion ambitions for companies in the medium term?</h4><p>We took delivery of our latest ethylene carrier earlier in 2014; however, while we have no immediate orders in the pipeline, we certainly have plans to expand our operational capacity over the coming years in line with our vision to become the leading shipping company in the region and in alignment with ADNOC Group's production growth. Accordingly, we are looking at a wide range of additional shipping options that could include VLCCs, LPG, chemical carriers, and container ships. In the meantime, we will focus our attention on improving our services by following best practices in all areas of operation. As part of this, we succeeded in the implementation of enterprise resource planning (ERP), an integrated business solution to all our support functions and the fleet. This makes ADNATCO and NGSCO one of the first marine companies in the region to have acquired such an integrated, technology-based approach to managing all our businesses.</p><div class="quote">“Our Cadetship Program, which trains UAE nationals to become seamen, is one of our most successful initiatives."</div><h4>How are ADNATCO and NGSCO planning on fighting high energy prices and resolving the need for more efficient and high-tech ships in the market?</h4><p>We believe that saving fuel consumption and establishing an organizational culture based on energy efficiency is an effective alternative fuel for the future. To achieve this, we embarked on an initiative called the Al Daffah Project, which was aimed at reducing the CO2 emissions generated by the company's ships. By using new tools and techniques in managing our fleet, as well as installing new measuring instruments to achieve the company's targets and improve key performance indicators (KPIs), Al Daffah's ultimate aim is to achieve huge savings in fuel consumption and greatly reduce CO2 emissions.</p><h4>How do you think your experience as UAE Governor of OPEC had a positive impact at ADNATCO and NGSCO?</h4><p>Working for OPEC enables you to have a holistic view of the world economy, particularly the vital role that the energy and transport sectors play in sustaining the vibrancy of global business. As our fleet works in global markets, the insights gained in my capacity as UAE Governor for OPEC definitely contributed to augment my strategic thinking and helps me make more informed decisions.</p><h4>The recent trends in the crude oil and products tanker market show demand growing in Asia. How do you see the market developing in the medium term, and what will be the strategy of ADNATCO and NGSCO to maintain their leading position in the region?</h4><p>We always look at the long term. Our strategic objective is to meet the needs for ADNOC and its group of companies for efficient marine transportation. We know that ADNOC certainly remains firmly committed to maintaining a strong presence in the shipping industry. This provides us with numerous opportunities to grow our business and stay in the lead.</p><h4>The maritime industry faces the increased threat of piracy. Which innovative defensive measures is ADNATCO implementing to ensure the protection of its seafarers and ships?</h4><p>We remain vigilant and ensure that we have the right preventative measures available to safeguard the security and safety of our crews and ships. We always seek innovative ways to strengthen the defensive mechanism of our ships, and I am happy to say that some of our company's award-winning innovations in this regard have been adopted by other companies.</p><h4>Through the Cadetship Program, ADNATCO and NGSCO are strongly committed to the employment of UAE nationals. How is ADNATCO and NGSCO currently investing in the UAE's capital by forming skilled petroleum professionals?</h4><p>Our Cadetship Program, which trains UAE nationals to become seamen, is one of our most successful initiatives in developing and employing UAE nationals in key positions throughout the company. Every year we accept over 40 new young high school graduates to join the program, which offers attractive career prospects. Over the years, we have trained hundreds of UAE nationals as maritime professionals, who today hold senior positions, not just at ADNATCO and NGSCO, but also in shipping and port companies throughout the UAE. As a result of this program, over 40% of our seafarers are Emirati nationals. Over time, our national seafarers are taking increasingly senior positions on-board our vessels and already hold Master and Chief Engineer tickets. We also provide a wide range of other opportunities for office-based UAE nationals. Our Tamkeen program provides a structured training program for onshore UAE nationals to support their long-term career development within the company.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the profile of the students following the highly popular MBA program of the Manchester Business School (MBS)?</h4><p>MBS opened the Middle East Centre in Dubai Knowledge Village in 2006 and was the first top-ranked school to open a physical presence in the region, offering the MBA, the world's most popular business qualification and a pre-requisite for a serious career in international business for many companies. Since we opened our Middle East Centre in Dubai, we have supported over 1,600 MBA students from 85 nationalities. They study for the highly applied graduate, post-experience degree; the part-time Manchester Global MBA program. The quality of our MBA students is a key feature of the region and around 10% of our students are already educated to the Master's level and 30% are already in c-level roles. Our students are highly committed working professionals who want to progress in their careers, or perhaps compete internationally. We have also seen many students use the MBA program to develop their entrepreneurial skills and launch their own businesses. In addition to current students, we have an alumni community in the Middle East comprising of around 2,000 graduates of our full-time and part-time MBA programs, making for a vibrant professional network. Our new Global Executive MBA program, launched in July 2014, is a more personalized program designed for the most senior executives, who will join the MBS international alumni community of more than 50,000 working professionals.</p><h4>What advantages does the MBA bring students who want to enter the workforce of Dubai?</h4><p>All our students are working professionals and our vision is to transform the careers and lives of our students and in doing so, transform their organizations and the communities in which they work. Student motivations for studying an MBA are very personal, but there are a number of common trigger factors. Career advancement and salary acceleration feature strongly, and students pursuing their MBA expect to move up or move out. We have many students with strong technical backgrounds or a very specific, functional set of skills, who use the MBA to broaden their business perspectives, competencies, and skill sets to move into different industries or more general management roles, and are able to apply their new knowledge immediately in the workplace. They do so with the help of the MBA and the additional career services that we offer them. Since the global economic recession, more students have increasingly found this period to be an excellent opportunity to use the MBA to help develop their entrepreneurial skills and start their own businesses. We continue to work extensively with our students beyond the MBA program, through our alumni relations, and we take an active interest in supporting their career development beyond just the networking opportunities and connections that the school provides.</p><h4>Most universities here in Dubai have partners with international or local companies, or governmental institutes to promote scholarships and networking opportunities. Which do you specifically have in Dubai?</h4><p>Collaboration is central to the way we work and to the success we have enjoyed in the Middle East, so we have many active partnerships in place, with government organizations, professional bodies, business groups, education clusters, and media, each of which is richly rewarding. You cannot succeed without aligning what you are doing with the overall vision and strategy of Dubai and the UAE to develop a diversified knowledge economy, and so from the outset we have worked with government organizations, whilst professional associations help us stay close to businesses and our programs up to date and relevant by making sure we understand the needs and aspirations of working professionals. We enjoy healthy collaboration with other MBA providers to help foster a wider active network working for the good of the country. A prime example of our commitment to our hosts and of the potential for collaboration here is the Manchester Innovation Award for Emiratis, an initiative of MBS, designed to stimulate entrepreneurship and business innovation among UAE nationals and provide practical, academic, and financial support to develop the best ideas submitted by Emirati entrepreneurs into successful businesses. The Award enjoyed the support of Dubai International Academic City as well as many other leading organizations from the private and public sectors. Recent research shows that Dubai is the fourth most sought-after destination for education worldwide and we often partner with Dubai's education clusters to promote Dubai as an education hub, at events and conferences. As a successful model of a global business school serving the region from Dubai, we actively promote the benefits of the partnership with Dubai Knowledge Village and Dubai International Academic City, which has been central to our achievements. A major milestone in this successful partnership was the University of Manchester's first MBA graduation ceremony in the Middle East, held in Dubai in 2013, and presided over by the Dean of MBS, Professor Fiona Devine. One particularly interesting set of collaborations has focused on the role and development of women in business in the region and we have been active promoters and supporters of those organizations recognizing this vital contribution, from regional awards recognizing the most influential women to sponsoring training programs for Dubai Women's Council to encourage and help women set up their own businesses through the support of one of our own entrepreneurial students.</p><div class="quote">“The local and regional economy has matured and diversified and we have kept pace with this."</div><h4>What is Dubai doing in order to cement its status as an educational hub?</h4><p>Dubai has taken many positive steps already to attract and support top quality education providers. When we wanted to set up our Middle East Centre in 2006, Dubai was the natural choice because of the strength of its “three Ts:" trade, tourism, and transportation. Dubai is very business-friendly and attracts top corporates and business service providers, as well as educated working professionals. Dubai International Academic City is the world's first purpose-built facility for education providers, and now hosts more than 20 international branches of  universities, the largest concentration anywhere in the world. As a partner of Dubai International Academic City and Dubai Knowledge City, this relationship has played a major role in our success and has led to the Middle East Centre becoming the largest and fastest growing center in the Manchester Business School international network, even larger than Shanghai and Manchester. There is an appetite and need for quality education providers in Dubai. MBS was the first top ranked business school to set up here, and received considerable support from Dubai and this support continues; Dubai is not taking its regional hub status for granted and it continues to involve its education partners and reinforce its regional hub status. Our students find everything they need here, from the world-class education that we provide, to high-quality infrastructure, transportation, and air connections. The creation of the Knowledge and Human Development Authority, which works closely with the education cluster, provides the reassurance that only quality education providers will operate here and receive support in the UAE. MBS has triple MBA accreditation and is often cited as a prime example of a successful, high-quality international education provider operating regionally from Dubai, and we are very proud to be held up as an example of what is possible. This has also led us to include Dubai as one of the four international host centers of MBS for students on our new Global Executive MBA (GEMBA) program, launched in July 2014</p><h4>How has the school changed in light of the diversification of the local economy?</h4><p>The local and regional economy has matured and diversified and we have kept pace with this, offering more flexible MBA options and a broader range of formats that are market-led, to match the way that people increasingly live and work—collaboratively, remotely, and on the go; sometimes face to face, often virtually. Business people still want the familiar flexibility of a top global business school, but want more and faster global networking opportunities. They also look for customized options for their MBAs for greater professional and personal development. For example, our new GEMBA program, launched in July 2014, starts in Manchester, then moves to Shanghai, comes to Dubai, then to Miami, and ends in Manchester 20 months later. It focuses on personal development, international exposure, and intensive coaching, as well as academic rigor. We are also looking at diversifying our sectoral focus with an increasing emphasis on healthcare, for example, and introducing more products in the future.</p><h4>Dubai has a number of universities as an educational hub. How do you value this competition?</h4><p>We welcome quality institutions and the increased choice they bring and the strength they add to the education cluster and the regional hub from which we all benefit. Students select MBS for our values and the programs we offer, and there is a market for all of the schools here. We all have different models and these suit some candidates better than others. As regards UK educational providers, we are supporting an initiative to promote recognition of the UK education brand, working very closely with UKTI and the British Embassy, and we join forces with all quality education providers to promote what UK education has to offer.</p><h4>The UAE government is spending more than 20% of GDP on education, but research is just a small part of it. What are your thoughts on this?</h4><p>We know how important research is, and also how challenging it can be and it needs greater coordination between the public bodies and private government organizations, education and research organizations, and sponsors. Our MBA degrees are research based, and MBS is a first-class research organization. Our MBA students undertake research as part of their program and the majority of their academic credits are based on research undertaken here. Now we are working to see how we can publish this substantial body of accumulated local research and make it available to the public. We also sponsor our full-time MBA students from Manchester and bring them to the region to work on part of their international business project. As a sponsor and researcher, we were delighted to collaborate on a research project with Dubai Knowledge Village and Dubai International Academic City, on the first research into the GCC market for executive education.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Valle del Cauca has managed to attract and successfully host international events such as the VII Pacific Alliance Summit and the World Games of 2013. How has the region worked to better position itself in the international arena?</h4><p>Those involved in regional development have the common goal of building trust. Fortunately, too, Cali and the region are two prosperous areas of Colombia that for unfortunate reasons suffered from serious deterioration in the past. However, over the past few years, the local authorities, along with the national government, have worked to turn that situation around. That's why building trust is important, and I have to say that we have succeeded so far. The region also has certain unique elements such as the Buenaventura Maritime Terminal and Port, with its state-of-the-art infrastructure on the Colombian Pacific coast, through which roughly 50% of the country's cargo passes. Although, in terms of infrastructure, we still have a long road ahead of us, we have already come a long way and there are some important ongoing projects. All this investment in infrastructure will boost Buenaventura's role at the national level.</p><h4>What advantages does the Pacific Alliance offer to the Valle del Cauca region?</h4><p>I think such initiatives are key to strengthening the formalization of employment in the region. For example, our free trade zone (FTZ) brought in a business model that hadn't been implemented here before. Such elements boost the industrialization of the region, too, improving the development of regional cities and generating employment opportunities.</p><div class="quote">“In order to take full advantage of these FTAs, the country needs to strengthen logistics chains."</div><h4>What role does CELPA play in the government's efforts to generate formal employment opportunities linked to the development of Buenaventura?</h4><p>We operate in a city in which unemployment and informal employment used to have a major impact on the local economy. I would even say that the ports were the only two entities generating significant formal employment opportunities before our arrival. In this context, we were established in 2012 and we implemented an employment strategy along with the national government that included large investments and the generation of qualified human resources that, in turn, made investment in our FTZ more attractive. In this context, we started implementing training courses in 2H2013 to teach a broader section of the local population about the technical and operational aspects of FTZs. Our idea is to train future business leaders for companies arriving here, as well as provide a skilled and qualified workforce. In this context, we have also implemented personalized training programs for specific companies. All in all, I think we are on the right track, which will be borne out over time. I think that once CELPA Permanent Free Trade Zone becomes 100% operative, in around three years time, we will be generating around 2,000 direct job positions in Buenaventura.</p><h4>How relevant is the Maritime Port of Buenaventura for Colombia? What role does CELPA play in the development of the Port of Buenaventura?</h4><p>Colombia offers a very attractive, competitive, and interesting FTZ business model. In this context, CELPA enjoys a privileged geostrategic location next to the main maritime infrastructure on the Pacific coast, which handles roughly 50% of Colombia's foreign trade. This activity impacts Colombia's entire economy. CELPA is the base, offering services that address the demands and requirements of the Port of Buenaventura. In this context, the port is in a process of specialization and we are the industrial and logistics platform that will achieve this.</p><h4>What are CELPA's plans to develop the 348,000-sqm site?</h4><p>We plan to invest $50 million in the urbanization and development of infrastructure in the FTZ. Currently, we have already invested $15 million as part of the first stage of development of the overall project. We are aware that we hold in our hands a promising and interesting project; however, we need to build trust among the investor community, which is only achieved by demonstrating the tangible development of the project itself. In this context, certain large banking institutions that believe in this project are supporting us, which definitely helps to build credibility. Also, I think we have achieved a common understanding between local authorities and the private sector on the future development of the city and the wider region. Therefore, this has been our main focus at this stage of development; to build trust and show that we are developing an economically viable and significant project. This will generate further investment for the project's subsequent stages of development that will continue to generate employment opportunities. CELPA always had the mission of establishing itself as a pre- and post-maritime port, industrial, and logistics platform located close to the Port of Buenaventura. In this context, we have a clear logistics and industrial vocation as a FTZ. Local authorities can support that with the development of strong educational and health platforms, as well as great infrastructure connectivity. Overall, I think we generate value-added for the Port of Buenaventura and the companies operating in it and around the port.</p><h4>How will the recently signed free trade agreements (FTAs) between Colombia and other countries impact CELPA's activity?</h4><p>In order to take full advantage of these FTAs, the country needs to strengthen logistics chains and platforms adjacent to its main maritime ports and airports, which will reduce production costs and make our industries even more competitive. CELPA can benefit very much from these FTAs, positioning itself as a tool for local and foreign investors to generate value-added and develop industrial activity, allowing them also to reach strategic markets from its operating centers. We should keep in mind that today, globalization renders the entire world our audience, which demands high efficiency and the exploitation of such facilities as FTAs.</p><h4>What are the competitive advantages of CELPA as an FTZ?</h4><p>We offer a promising and real platform in Buenaventura that did not exist before. We are an industrial and logistics platform that offers total legal security and support, located next to the Port of Buenaventura, which helps to reduce production costs. CELPA allows investors to get a return on their investment within five years thanks to the tax environment that we offer, which means more efficient and profitable companies make the FTZ their base.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>General Electric (GE) established its regional headquarters in Panama in 2012. What have been the milestones for the company over the past two years?</h4><p>GE has been in Panama since the construction of the Panama Canal, providing the equipment needed for its functioning. It was a major milestone for GE to create new technologies for transportation, hydraulics, power systems, and power control, even more because some of the original GE equipment from 1910 is still operational. More recently, GE has been providing products, technology, and financial solutions to Panama and other countries in Central America and the Caribbean. GE has a very important oil and gas operation in Trinidad and Tobago, while continuing our presence in the power generation, medical equipment, and jet engines markets to multiple customers in the region.</p><h4>The company established its headquarters in Panama under Law 41 for Multinational Companies. What are the main advantages for establishing here and what is the importance of Panama for GE?</h4><p>The most important advantage of Law 41 is the flexible regulatory framework, because under this legislation GE has been able to bring technology and train both locals and international customers in the latest technology. One point in case is the ninth worldwide GE Healthcare Global Services Training Center, opened in Panama City. Moreover, some of our global customers have their regional operations in Panama, which makes it only natural for GE to be located where our customers are.</p><h4>GE is present in the 37 countries of Central America and the Caribbean. Which are the most important, operationally speaking?</h4><p>Panama's impressive economic growth and its logistical services, particularly in the aviation sector, are very important for us; but not less important than Trinidad and Tobago's energy-intensive economy and its considerable industrial base that provides important market opportunities to our high-tech gas technology applied to natural gas liquefaction. The Dominican Republic, for example, is making important strides in improving its power generation market, and GE is there to support them with technology and high-efficiency power generating turbines. In Central America, we are making significant progress, not only in transmission control systems, but also by providing energy-efficient solutions based on gas availability, such as LNG or LPG.</p><div class="quote">“Social responsibility is very important to GE everywhere we operate."</div><h4>Panama and Trinidad and Tobago have signed a Partial Scope Agreement for the exportation of gas. What is the impact of such agreements for Panama's energy sector?</h4><p>It is clearly a new opportunity to change the energy matrix in Panama. For the very first time, LNG is being considered as a possible fuel for electricity generation. Other countries in the region are also looking at the possibility to move into this cleaner fuel. LNG brings its own complexities as far as scale, volumes, and infrastructure requirements to receive and handle a completely new fuel. GE has the equipment, technology, and expertise to support LNG terminals and natural gas power generation, but one important step toward the use of natural gas in the region is associated with the integration of the Central America electric market. In the Caribbean, GE is supporting some of the local efforts related to this technology. For example, the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico already have their own LNG terminals.</p><h4>What role can public-private partnerships (PPPs) play in terms of the energy market regarding foreign investment?</h4><p>PPP is a very useful concept, particularly when companies can operate in an environment where the initiative runs under a very clear set of rules, and regulation is unbiased toward any of the partners. We are looking at the new legislation being introduced in the region, and the definition of these structures and the financial requirements that will come along with these opportunities. We are committed to diving deep into these business opportunities and bringing our experience from other parts of the world to the region.</p><h4>What is the view of GE in terms of corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives and sustainability?</h4><p>Social responsibility is very important to GE everywhere we operate. You can tell it from the commitment of our workforce to do more, and reach out in our volunteers. Our commitment to design and manufacture products for the betterment of people all over the world, particularly products that will be in operation for decades, is also important. With “ecomagination," GE dedicates a significant amount of resources to design and produce technology that preserves the environment.</p><h4>According to some sources, 17% of energy produced in Panama is lost due to faulty transmission lines. How would you evaluate Panama's energy infrastructure?</h4><p>Generally, infrastructure plays catch up with demand; and for this reason, systems need to work with some spare capacity. Electricity must move from generation to consumption, and the only way to do it is with adequate transmission and distribution lines. One cannot operate without the other.</p><h4>What does General Electric foresee in the mid-term in Panama?</h4><p>We are positive about Panama and not just because of its high economic growth rates, but because it is an excellent location to operate from. Central America and the Caribbean is a challenging region with new opportunities coming along at all times. GE arrived in Panama for the construction of the Canal, and, after a hundred years, there is no reason to move anywhere else.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As the first company in Tanzania to produce natural gas, how would you describe PanAfrican Energy's pioneering role in this sector?</h4><p>PanAfrican Energy is a subsidiary of Orca Exploration Group, which is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. At the beginning of the 1990s, the company began discussions with the Tanzania government about developing the Songo Songo gas field. At that time the government had not yet decided what to do with the gas, after having made a serious effort for 10 years to develop the gas for a fertilizer project without success. Following the first of several bouts of power rationing in the national grid system in 1992 due to drought and over-dependence on hydro-based power, the government decided to use the gas for power generation. Development proposals were solicited from several companies in 1993, and the PanAfrican Energy and TransCanada Pipelines were selected for negotiations. Formal negotiations commenced in 1994 and continued until October 2001 when the Songo Songo Project agreements were signed. It was a profound learning experience for PanAfrican Energy, the government, TPDC, TANESCO, and probably all of the other eight parties to the 18 agreements that were needed to define the project legally, physicaly, and commercially. The parties included the World Bank and other development finance institutions. The scope of the project included gas exploration, development, production, transportation by pipeline and marketing to industries, and power generation, as well as payment guarantee mechanisms. Even today the commercial arrangements of the Songo Songo gas-to-electricity project represent a complex but practical way to balance risks and rewards for the parties. In putting the arrangements together Tanzania had never undertaken a project like this before, and on several occasions the negotiations nearly failed. PanAfrican's role as the gas development pioneer in collaboration with Songas, and as TPDC's partner in gas production sharing, has essentially been to enable Tanzania to become East and Central Africa's first commercial natural gas producer and to demonstrate that it is capable of attracting, negotiating, and hosting projects as complex as Songo Songo. This has no doubt contributed to attracting the larger foreign investment that has since led to the discovery of the much bigger offshore gas resources. After a decade of production TPDC and the government have together earned over 80% of the net gas sales revenue. The issues that make a small investor comfortable with the national environment are generally the same issues that make the big ones comfortable. After 10 years of operations, PanAfrican Energy is still around, and this speaks to our positive outlook.</p><h4>How will PanAfrican Energy work to expand the production capacity of its assets in Songo Songo?</h4><p>There are some geological structures near the main Songo Songo reservoir that have yet to be drilled that may yield additional volumes of gas beyond the current estimate of about a trillion cubic feet. At the moment, PanAfrican Energy is negotiating with the government the terms on which it will double gas production capacity from 100 million to 200 million cubic feet per day in order to provide enough gas for the National Natural Gas Infrastructure Project (NNGIP), which is dedicated to delivering gas mainly for power generation.</p><div class="quote">“Tanzania has and will continue to have many opportunities for energy sector investors."</div><h4>How would you describe the current environment for foreign energy companies trying to operate in Tanzania?</h4><p>If you consider the basics, Tanzania is in a relatively unexplored and underdeveloped region. It has considerable petroleum potential, as is evident from the gas that has already been discovered, and it has one of the fastest growing economies in Africa. At the same time, the strategic location of Tanzania is a huge bonus, and with adequate infrastructure it could become an economic gateway to Southern and Central Africa. That being said, we are of course in a tough neighborhood, as the past 50 years of the region's history have shown. But Tanzania stands out as being stable, which is of course a very positive attribute. The overall environment is therefore attractive in terms of the investment opportunities that exist, but it is challenging when it comes to dealing with the complicated processes for negotiating with the government and other local partners, obtaining the necessary permits and approvals, and dealing with the commercial and taxation issues and stakeholder relations once projects are up and running. A particularly challenging aspect of the investment environment recently has been TANESCO's inability to meet its payment obligations to private energy suppliers. This issue will hopefully be addressed by the government through the extensive restructuring and commercialization of the power sector that it has just launched. Another challenge is that even though the basic terms of petroleum exploration and development agreements are clear, the policy environment is still being defined. This makes the future value of oil and gas development investments difficult to project and thus enhances perceptions of risk. For example, the new Gas Act is expected to prescribe a gas industry structure that was not envisaged under the existing production sharing agreements.</p><h4>How confident are you that the Gas Act, currently in its draft stage, will address most of the sector's major framework concerns?</h4><p>It is difficult to describe how a shoe fits without wearing it first. Issues will definitely arise during the anticipated discussions about the Gas Act in which stakeholders will seek to further or safeguard their interests. Although the stakeholders have an overriding common interest, they nevertheless will have competing sub-interests. No doubt we will see stakeholders attempting to  have the Gas Act crafted so that their interests and concerns are addressed. It will be difficult to completely satisfy any stakeholder or group. The key will be to strike a balance that everyone can live with, the overriding consideration being to facilitate the optimal, efficient development of the gas industry within the boundaries set by natural gas policy. Once we start implementing the Act, issues that the stakeholders had not foreseen will probably emerge, and that may require amendments to legislation or new regulations to iron those issues out.</p><h4>How would you characterize PanAfrican Energy's role in the NNGIP?</h4><p>The company's involvement will be simply as a supplier of some of the gas that will be needed in order to bring the new NNGIP pipeline into operation. PanAfrican Energy is expected to provide up to 100 million cubic feet per day to the NNGIP. However, production will have to be doubled to 200 million cubic feet per day. As I mentioned earlier, we are currently in negotiations with the Ministry of Energy and Minerals and TPDC about the gas price and other terms that will enable PanAfrican Energy to secure financing from the International Finance Corporation (IFC) to double gas production. We are talking about an initial investment of about $150 million in order to drill new wells, service some of existing ones, and install additional infrastructure.</p><h4>What is PanAfrican Energy's long-term future in the country?</h4><p>Tanzania has and will continue to have many opportunities for energy sector investors. As long as those opportunities are assessed to make business sense, PanAfrican Energy will consider pursuing them. The company took nearly a decade of hard work to earn the government's final approval to invest in Tanzania, and it has now been here for a decade producing gas reliably, with no major problems or incidents, for generating most of the power in the national grid and for the largest industries in Dar es Salaam. We would obviously want to continue that way indefinitely.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did Norm perform over 2013?</h4><p>It was a very busy year, being the last phase of our project. We did our best to complete the cement plant and get production underway. In September, we successfully commenced cement production at our plant, and in October, after ensuring the quality of our product, we started to market it. Over the course of 2014, we expect to increase the range of grades and achieve full production capacity.</p><h4>What led to the establishment of Norm?</h4><p>The construction industry in Azerbaijan is one of the fastest growing industries today. It has become one of the driving forces of the country's economic development. A growing need increased the investments aimed at cement production and stimulated Norm to implement the Norm Cement plant project. When the company was established, Azerbaijan was importing 65% of its cement needs either in direct cement or clinker form. In the cement industry, clinker is a core input. Once you produce clinker, you can grind it into cement or else sell it directly as a product. Currently, the installed capacity of Azerbaijan can meet just 35% of demand, meaning that 65% was imported from neighboring countries, mainly Iran. This was one of the driving forces behind our construction of the plant. Another driving force was to bring up the quality of cement in Azerbaijan.</p><div class="quote">“The Norm Cement plant is the largest cement plant in the South Caucasus."</div><h4>What are the special features of the plant?</h4><p>The Norm Cement plant is the largest cement plant in the South Caucasus. The capacity of plant is 5,000 tons of clinker per day and 2 million tons of cement a year. The plant, constructed in the Garadagh district of Baku, is designed according to the most advanced European technology. The main process equipment of the plant is supplied from leading manufacturers in Germany, France, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and other EU countries. The cutting-edge technologies and equipment will ensure high quality, safety, and efficiency, as well as minimize fuel and power consumption while preserving the most stringent European and global ecological standards. The project, one of the largest in terms of investments in the non-oil sector, will cost $350 million and provide immense social and economic benefits.</p><h4>What measures are taken for environmental protection?</h4><p>In the cement industry the biggest pollution comes from dust emission. The proper control of dust emissions requires significant investment in technology and environmental protection equipment. At the Norm Cement plant, the entire production line is equipped with modern dust filters. Air quality is continuously monitored by the optical measuring devices installed in all sources of dust according to the strictest standards. The allowable dust emission by EU standards is 35 mg per cubic meter, while filters installed at our plant ensure 30 mg/cubic meter or less. The plant is equipped with a strict noise protection system to comply with another EU standard of 85 dB maximum noise at 1 meter from the source. The application of the latest technologies ensures the operation of the plant in accordance with European and international environmental norms.</p><h4>What sectors account for the bulk of your portfolio?</h4><p>In Azerbaijan, there is roughly an equal three-way distribution between residential, infrastructure, and non-residential construction. A total of 4.5 million tons of cement is consumed in Azerbaijan. We want to be present in all the segments of the cement market, including infrastructure, residential, and non-residential. By the end of 2014, we will have a large portfolio of products targeted at all cement segments. The Norm Cement plant will also supply the oil industry of Azerbaijan and of the whole Caspian region with oil-well cement that complies with the standards of the American Petroleum Institute. We will start producing this type of cement for the oil industry at the beginning of 2015.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Turkish Airlines (THY) was named “Best Airline in Europe" for the third consecutive year in 2013. What key factors have contributed toward this achievement?</h4><p>Naturally, as a global carrier, we have adopted the “hub and spoke" strategy, which given our unique geographical position provides us with enormous reach. That is an exceptional opportunity that no other airline can boast. In fact, our excellent geographical position translates into a 30% cost reduction when compared to most European carriers. Waste is anathema to our corporate culture, and cost cutting is a way of life. Moreover, we enjoy greater economies of scale thanks to our fleet of new aircraft. Accordingly, our production costs decline by virtue of increased productivity. Our strategy, therefore, is based on cost cutting in pursuit of growth through productivity.</p><h4>THY recently signed a $560 million deal with International Aero Engines (IAE) to power 25 new A321 aircraft with V2500 engines. Could you elaborate on consequences of this deal?</h4><p>THY entered into an agreement under which IAE AG's V2500 engines will power 25 new A321 aircraft in our fleet. This brings the total number of V2500-powered A320 aircraft to 90. The deal is valued at $560 million and includes an option for a 12-year Fleet Hour Agreement. The aircraft will be delivered between 2015 and 2017. We appreciate our long-standing relationship with IAE, and are delighted with the reliability of our V2500 engines. The engine supports our mission to become the preferred European air carrier with a global network, since we are one of Europe's fastest growing airlines.</p><div class="quote">“We are of the belief that the center of gravity of the global aviation market is still shifting from West to East."</div><h4>Which new routes or regions is Turkish Airlines prioritizing as part of its expansion strategy?</h4><p>We are of the belief that the center of gravity of the global aviation market is still shifting from West to East, which should become ever more relevant for Istanbul over the next decade. Meanwhile, we value the African continent for being a relatively undiscovered aviation market. Ultimately, however, as a global network carrier flying to more countries than any other airline with the largest international network, one can say that the entire globe is our market. Via our hub in Istanbul, we fly to almost every point in Europe and crucial points in the Middle East, Africa, the Americas, and Asia. Over time, we will also enhance our service in the Americas and Asia, while commencing flights to Australia.</p><h4>What are your main targets for 2014?</h4><p>According to the non-consolidated 2014 budget approved by our Board of Directors, the guidance regarding Turkish Airlines' targets and expectations is as follows. By the end of 2014, our fleet number is set to reach 267, including 204 narrow-body, 54 wide-body, and nine cargo aircraft. With the inclusion of 16 new routes, the total number of destinations we serve will reach 259. Meanwhile, the total number of passengers carried is targeted to reach to 59.5 million including 26.2 million on scheduled domestic routes, 32.3 million on scheduled international routes, and the remainder on charter and Hajj flights. While the passenger load factor is expected to be 78.8%, total available seat kilometers (ASK) will reach 141 billion on an increase of 21% compared to 2013. Capacity ASK is expected to rise 33% in Turkey, 29% in South America, 25% in Africa, 22% in the Far East, 20% in North America, 16% in Europe, and 13% in the Middle East. In 2014, cargo/mail carried will increase by 23% to 653,000 tons. Compared to 2013, we expect a 2% decrease (in TL terms) in passenger yield on domestic routes, a 1% increase (in EUR terms) on international routes, and a 2% increase (in USD terms) in ex-fuel unit costs. In 2014, Turkish Airlines' total personnel count is expected to rise 18% along with a 23% increase in fuel consumption, and 2% increase in utilization levels compared to 2013. As a result of scheduled commercial activities, Turkish Airlines is targeting to increase its sales revenue by 17% to $11.4 billion.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The latest National Institute of Ecology and Climate Change (INECC) figures shows that Mexico released 748 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) in 2010, which represents 1.4% of the world's emissions. What specific programs is SEMARNAT implementing to reverse this trend?</h4><p>On April 28, 2014 the Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT) launched the Special Climate Change Program 2014-2018 (PECC). The PECC is one of the policy planning instruments derived from the General Climate Change Law (LGCC), and is aligned to the National Development Plan (PND), cross-sectional programs from the federal government, and the sectorial programs from 14 federal ministries that participate in the Inter-Ministerial Commission on Climate Change. The PECC lays out a diagnosis of the present situation of Mexico regarding climate change. It comprises five objectives, 26 strategies, and 199 lines of action, of which 77 focus on adaptation, 81 on mitigation, and 41 on the construction of public policies for tackling climate change. It also includes an annex with 31 complementary climate change-related activities and 10 performance indicators to monitor the results of the program during the 2014-2018 period using a 2013 baseline, a 2018 goal, and a calculation methodology. The PECC aims to reduce the vulnerability of the population, ecosystems, and productive sectors to climate change, as well as increase resilience in strategic infrastructure. This program presents the federal government's contribution to the greenhouse gases (GHG) emission reduction indicative goal prescribed by the LGCC for the 2014-2018 period, specifically 30% GHG emission reductions with respect to the business-as-usual scenario by 2020. The total amount of GHG reductions to be accomplished by the implementation of PECC mitigation actions is 83 MtCO2e. The contribution of states and municipalities (sub-national governments) and the private and social sectors will be essential to attaining the goals adopted by Mexico both in adaptation and mitigation.</p><h4>What is going to be the impact of the pilot program for using natural gas in transport that SEMANART recently launched?</h4><p>The pilot program is considered a part of the National Development Plan 2013-2018, and aims to strengthen national climate change policy and environmental care for the transition to a competitive, sustainable, and low-carbon economy as well to reduce risks to health and mitigate the emission of compounds and GHGs. As a starting point, a pilot program has been established in the city of Monterrey, which will equip the latter with the largest natural gas infrastructure for vehicular use in the country, both in number of compressor stations and transport units that use natural gas vehicles. The pilot project aims to be implemented in the metropolitan area of Monterrey, and pursues the goal of 8,000 vehicles using natural gas in the medium term, of which approximately 18% will be taxis, 38% heavy vehicles (including passenger and heavy duty trucks or light duty trucks), and 44% light vehicles. The environmental benefits of using natural gas, relative to gasoline and diesel, for example, are there. Decreases were recorded in the range of 25% for CO2 emissions compared to gasoline and 35% compared to diesel. For mono-nitrogen oxides (NOx) and carbon monoxide, emissions are estimated at being 35% and 95% lower, respectively. In the case of sulfur dioxide, the reduction would be 100% using natural gas. Other benefits include not contaminating soil or groundwater, while combustion is practically odorless and the noise level is much lower than conventional motors. The economic benefits are that natural gas is the cheapest fuel available and all varieties are tax-free. Vehicle natural gas, currently distributed in Monterrey, presents ample competitiveness with conventional fuels, 50% from Magna gasoline, up 51% compared to diesel, and up to 26% compared to LPG. In matters of security, natural gas is safer because it is lighter than air, dissipates immediately, and has a low risk of detonation. It is stressed that this project is now in its infancy and is expected, in the short term, to be replicated in other states around Mexico.</p><h4>What is the significance for Mexico of being a founding member of the Global Environment Facility (GEF)? And what is the importance of the “National Dialogue" program that the government and GEF recently announced?</h4><p>Mexico was a founding member of the GEF from the pilot phase in 1991 and, together with Colombia and Venezuela, was one of the few developing countries that supported the GEF as the financial instrument of the Rí­o Conventions. Following objections from the G77, the final decision that was reached was for the GEF to be the interim financial instrument. Mexico participated in the first replenishment exercise and, in March of 1993, the first round of commitments to the instrument, the GEF trust fund, was reached, with financial support from developed countries and some developing countries, including Brazil, China, Egypt, India, Mexico, Pakistan, and Turkey. That converted GEF from a pilot project into a reality. Mexico has participated in all six replenishments and, recently, in Cancún, we announced it will double its financial commitment to the GEF from $10 million to $20 million. As both a donor and recipient country since 1991, Mexico has contributed a total of $32 million to the GEF and has received more than $450 million in grants. During GEF-5 (2010-2014), Mexico contributed $10 million to the GEF and received an allocation of $98.25 million. This is 2.3% of the entire allocation of GEF-5, and makes Mexico the fifth-largest recipient of resources following China, India, Brazil, and Russia. So it is clear that Mexico has been an important partner with the GEF since the beginning, both as a donor and a recipient country. The National Dialogue that was carried out last November as part of the preparatory activities for the GEF 5th Assembly included a roundtable between the GEF CEO and President, Naoko Ishii, and more than 30 representatives from the private sector, chambers of commerce, and development banks. It was very important because Mexican businessmen and women were able to discuss elements of the GEF's strategy to engage the private sector directly with Naoko Ishii and her senior staff prior to the final rounds of the replenishment negotiations. Other issues that were discussed included public-private partnerships (PPPs), the possibility of GEF support for nationally appropriate mitigation actions (NAMAs) in the private sector, investment in clean-energy projects, and areas of opportunity for co-financing activities in the GEF's Small Grants Program. More recently, during the GEF 5th Assembly in Cancún, the government of Mexico and the GEF Secretariat convened at a side event that was attended by a large number of relevant actors from the private sector from all over the world. Some of the issues raised included potential roles for commercial banks, development banks, and the private sector in financing sustainable projects, and how to improve coordination between the different actors to advance more rapidly on the issues of finance for sustainable development and how to foment need-based innovative finance.</p><div class="quote">“The country's government assumes full responsibility for promoting sustainable growth in harmony with our natural resources."</div><h4>You recently defined the energy reform as an environmental reform. What will be the contribution of the new regulation in attracting investment for renewable energy?</h4><p>The energy reform established obligations of clean compounds and reductions in GHGs and energy for participants in the electricity industry. The renewable resources are sufficient to double the installed capacity so far and to meet the goal by 2024 to generate electricity with 35% renewable energy capacity. The transition to renewables in terms of economic costs is not higher compared to conventional sources, especially when considering their co-benefits, including not depleting a non-renewable natural resource like natural gas, which can be made available for better uses in petrochemicals. The old fuel-oil plants will be gradually updated, operating with cleaner fuels such as natural gas, which is less harmful to the health of the communities living in the vicinity of old thermal power plants. Pipeline investments that are being made right now and the plans to make use of shale gas will certainly be useful toward the 2024 goal. The growth of the grid will be a recoverable investment for the state since the electricity market itself will take care of paying the amortized cost corresponding to the wheeling fee. The reform has multiple benefits and democratizes the power supply by making it cheaper in the medium term for many users of high domestic rates under current conditions. In the long term, it will mean huge savings by avoiding energy losses in transmission and distribution, and this will be the true reduction in electricity rates for much of the population. Positive for GDP, the generation of jobs and tax revenues, if 60,000 GWh of renewable technologies were to be developed by 2024, about 150,000 jobs would be created, similar to the current workforce of the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE), considering retiring employees and assets, and the tax revenues would total $23 billion.</p><h4>What is the role of SEMANART in boosting green business in the country?</h4><p>Actions in the environmental sector are aimed at the promotion, regulation, and support of improved environmental performance in the productive sector, both directly and through joint efforts with other federal programs and state and municipal governments. As part of SEMARNAT's strategy to boost linking actions with the private sector, environmental care is a window of real opportunity to promote financial development in Mexico, as well as a mechanism to boost domestic and international tourism. In Mexico, only 0.6% of GDP comes from green business like recycling garbage in a comprehensive manner, forest sustainability, green transportation, renewable energy generation, and ecotourism, which generate economic resources and provide added value each year, increasing its demand and acceptance among the people. It is intended that the increases in productivity and economic growth will be linked to the lower emission of GHGs, less environmental damage, and an increased contribution of environmental goods in GDP, as well as the formal creation of green jobs, particularly benefiting populations living in vulnerable areas and/or with high and very high marginalization rates. The National Special Program on Sustainable Consumption and Production, established by the National Development Plan 2013-2018, aims to link the different public sector bodies involved in production and consumption as well as the private sector and social elements to move toward lifestyles and sustainable patterns of production and consumption. This program involves all producers and service providers to adopt standards that reduce dependence on natural resources and the generation of emissions and waste, and promote recycling and the reuse of materials, making their supply chains sustainable sectors. One of the most strategic sectors in Mexico is micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs), which represent 99.8% of business units in the country, 52% of GDP, and 72% of employment and manufacturing, and to which SEMARNAT will boost funding for renewable energy and energy efficiency, promote the development of sustainable projects, and incubate companies, as well as certify sustainable production and consumption based on recognized standards; likewise, chaining federal and international economic instruments promotes and generates cross-sector partnerships and public platforms to support the transition to sustainable production and consumption practices.</p><h4>What strategies should be taken over the medium term in terms of increasing Mexican competitiveness and taking advantage of the natural resources of the country?</h4><p>The country's government assumes full responsibility for promoting sustainable growth in harmony with our natural resources through the 4th National Goal of the National Development Plan 2013-2018, called México Próspero, through an extensive process that incorporates experiences and proposals from various sectors of society. To achieve sustainable and inclusive economic growth, as well as meet the goal of reaching better wellness for all families, it is necessary that the search for greater productivity concatenates efforts for economic growth with purposes of greater social inclusion and the sustainable use of natural resources and ecosystem services. The planning, development, regulation, and direct support to the conservation and restoration of ecosystems, their biodiversity, and the environmental services they provide, as well as their sustainable use, contribute to increased productivity and job creation and welfare between the owners and beneficial owners of these resources, and so favor compliance with México Próspero as the strategy to protect the natural heritage of the country. To achieve reforms and public policies, including environmental stewardship, it is essential to trigger greater economic development, increase productivity, create jobs, and overcome poverty in the long term. Aligning the different federal programs will promote a mainstreaming scheme in order to enhance the efforts of the environment sector.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What new hospitality projects are you bringing to Dubai in 2014?</h4><p>We are set to undertake approximately 5 million square feet of projects in 2014. One-fifth of this will be allocated to the hospitality sector, either for serviced apartments or for the hotel business with four-and five-star hotels offering superior amenities. The main focus at first will be on serviced apartments, which are in high demand ahead of Expo 2020.</p><h4>How is the Atria project developing?</h4><p>The Atria is a project of approximately 725,000 square feet divided into two buildings, with amenities and retail services. Of the two buildings, one is a residential with 219 units of one, two, and three bedrooms, and has already sold out. Conceptualized by UK-based designers, yoo Studio, the hotel apartment tower, which is comprised of 347 units, will feature studios, one-, two-, and three-bedroom apartments, and three bedroom duplex units across a 30-floor complex. Our strategy is to give added value to our clients, not only with the brand name, but also with the interior design. Our designer is renowned as one of the best in the world.</p><div class="quote">“Dubai has streamlined its policies in a way that enables long-term, sustained development in the real estate and property sector."</div><h4>What is your strategy for improving profitability?</h4><p>In 2012, Deyaar turned AED38.6 million in consolidated net profit and, in 2013, we quadrupled that to an AED154.5 million consolidated net profit. We have seen growth in our stock and hope that profits will continue to rise for the next few years at least. Deyaar's strategy is to diversify its capabilities in the real estate sector and, accordingly, has decided to expand its development portfolio beyond commercial and residential properties, with the inclusion of hospitality projects. In line with our new direction, we have allotted up to 1 million square feet for hotel and serviced apartment projects in prime locations in the city in the coming years. We aim for the right mix, but we will also maintain our hospitality projects. Some of these properties will be retained as fully owned developments under Deyaar, while other projects will be sold to third-party investors.</p><h4>Over 2013, Deyaar added around 600 units to its portfolio. How many units are you planning to add in 2014?</h4><p>We are handing over 180 units. We also have previous stock that remains available. In terms of sales, there are about 500 units available in various areas. Also, through our joint ventures, such as Central Park, a mixed-used development located at the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), a project with Dubai Properties, we will be adding a further 426, two-thirds of which are already sold.</p><h4>What is the percentage of foreigners investing in the company?</h4><p>Deyaar has been one of the most traded stocks on the Dubai Financial Market. The shareholding structure since we took the company public was a minimum of 51% for UAE nationals, with the rest being from the GCC. One of the main shareholders holds about a 41% stake. Another point decided on in 2013 was that the UAE listed company on the stock market would become listed in the Morgan Stanley Index, which allows our shareholders to trade their shares for international funds. This is something that usually comes with longer-term investment. The condition is that the company must have 20% to 25% foreign ownership. We offer value to our existing shareholders as well as interested parties from international markets. The company currently allocates 49% of shares to GCC citizens and foreign investors. However, foreign ownership must not exceed 25% of the total shares allocated. Emiratis, meanwhile, enjoy unlimited share allocation as long as the percentage of shares is maintained at 51% and above.</p><h4>What is your opinion of Dubai's regulatory regime in the real estate sector?</h4><p>Over the past few years, Dubai has streamlined its policies in a way that enables long-term, sustained development in the real estate and property sector, which I think is exceptional, considering this is still a nascent market. With all the regulations in place, it is only a matter of ensuring that developers comply with them before they launch their projects. Ideally, a project should be launched only after getting the master plan approved by the authorities, which should also ascertain that the plan is strictly adhered to during the execution stage as well. I believe that as key players in the real estate market, it is our responsibility toward the community and our stakeholders to offer uncompromising standards in terms of our products and services.</p><h4>Currently, there is about $350 million being invested in the real estate and construction sector in Dubai. What is your opinion on this?</h4><p>When I drive around the UAE, I see a huge growth in the number of projects. The federal and local governments have been spending heavily, and there are some projects emerging that will impact the industry overall. One major issue is related to labor. Following the crisis, many companies chose to let many laborers go. As these large projects require workers, the market may eventually face a skilled labor issue. This will impact the real estate industry as costs will increase. I do not anticipate any huge increases in material costs, but there will be an issue with labor.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the real estate sector in 2014?</h4><p>Dubai has always been competitive and attractive. For people planning to stay, there will always be demand for hotels. In 2014, we are confident of a leasing perspective, and expect there to hardly be any vacancies. As far as sales and the launching of new projects goes, this is dependent on market liquidity. If you have good projects, you will be able to sell them. If the location and quality are right, then people will be interested in buying it. I think this market will continue to grow, and people from the region will continue to have an interest in Dubai and invest in real estate here.</p><h4>Does Deyaar have any plans for expansion?</h4><p>We already have an international presence having completed a project in Lebanon, and have had investments in Turkey for several years. Unfortunately, for various reasons we had to exit the latter country in late 2013. This said, we are open to any opportunities that may arise in Turkey or the Middle East.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>This year marked the beginning of the third term in office for President Ilham Aliyev. What does this new era mean for the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of the Population?<br></h4><p>This election was one of the biggest contributors to the prospects for Azerbaijan's future development. The people of Azerbaijan exercised their suffrage in a free, democratic, and transparent manner and cast their votes of appreciation for the country's achievements in the political, public, and economic spheres. The people have voted for the further successful development of Azerbaijan on the basis of the principles of sustainable development, political stability, and social justice under the leadership of Ilham Aliyev, President of the Republic of Azerbaijan. As a result of the successful reforms carried out in Azerbaijan in recent years, our society-oriented national economy has become fully integrated into the global economy, the achievements made have been further reinforced, macroeconomic stability has been maintained, economic diversification into non-oil sectors and regional development have accelerated, and government assistance for private sector development has further expanded. This has led to a dramatic reduction in the levels of poverty and unemployment, a tangible improvement in the standard of living, and greater social security for the most vulnerable categories of the population. The next stage of the country's development also envisages a focus on social aspects. As is the case in all other areas, this requires the modernization of the governance system on the basis of new approaches. All of these processes have paved the way for the application of new approaches on the part of the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of the Population, which implements the social policies of the state. These approaches require the implementation of the tasks stipulated under the “Azerbaijan 2020: Vision for the Future" development concept and call for a restructuring of the Ministry's activities through the establishment of new subordinated agencies.</p><h4>What were the Ministry's main accomplishments in 2013 and what are you looking to achieve over 2014?</h4><p>Extensive work has been carried out to protect the labor rights of Azerbaijani citizens, improve employment opportunities, reinforce the social protection of the population, provide state benefits to the lower-income population, prepare various regulatory documents in relation to presidential pensions and other social benefits, as well as to develop and implement pilot projects, study best international practices, and modernize the system of social protection as a whole. As a result of the successful implementation of the state program on the implementation of the employment strategy in Azerbaijan covering the 2011-2015 period, approved by order of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan dated November 15, 2011, as well as other state programs of a social nature, we have succeeded in dramatically reducing the level of unemployment, enhancing the social protection of the vulnerable population, modernizing the plight of the labor market, improving the quality and competitiveness of labor reserves, and developing human capital in cooperation with relevant government agencies. The implementation of the Social Protection Development project jointly with the World Bank has helped us improve the quality of the services provided to the jobless, job seekers, and socially sensitive population, strengthen the capacity of the State Employment Service and the State Labor Inspectorate, create an information management system for the State Employment Service, modernize vocational training for youngsters, prepare and introduce vocational and training programs in accordance with ISCO 88/08, and put in place a system of social protection for the unemployed and job seekers, all meeting contemporary international standards. In 2014, the main focus of the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of the Population will be on improving the housing conditions of people with disabilities and the families of martyrs, while also providing disabled war veterans with motor vehicles and benefits. In addition, leaning on the best international practice, we intend to continue working to further improve the system of medical and social rehabilitation, introducing new types of rehabilitation services, aligning the disability criteria with international standards, providing those in need of social assistance with adequate services, engaging qualified professionals, eliminating the factors that can potentially lead to irregularity, and building the relationship between civil servants and citizens in accordance with ethical standards.</p><div class="quote">“Extensive work has been carried out to protect the labor rights of Azerbaijani citizens."</div><h4>In what ways can technology and innovation increase employment opportunities for Azerbaijan's youth?</h4><p>The announcement of 2013 as the Year of ICT in Azerbaijan was primarily intended to facilitate the development of e-government and promote the introduction of electronic services. Specific work was carried out to introduce state-of-the-art service mechanisms, eliminate situations that may lead to cases of corruption and bribery, and to minimize the scope of relations between government officials and citizens. The introduction of financial and tax breaks for employers hiring young specialists, the alignment of the educational system with the growing needs of the national economy, greater focus on the development of vocational education, the provision of uninterrupted educational opportunities, the establishment of job fairs for young people, and a number of other activities have been very helpful. On the one hand, the introduction of new technologies and innovations will enable young people to promptly acquire information about vacancies, employer specialization requirements, and job descriptions, facilitating their integration into the labor market and helping them develop their knowledge and skills using modular and multimedia technologies based on competitive educational and training programs. The development of technologies and innovation will provide an impetus to the creation of new industrial enterprises based on local raw materials and the application of cutting-edge technologies, playing an important role in the sustainable development of the non-oil sector, including the creative economy based on intellectual property and tourism infrastructure, and inevitably lead to the greater employment of young specialists in these enterprises. In addition, as part of the Social Protection Development project implemented jointly by the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of the Population and the World Bank, local and international experts have carried out activities to improve employment opportunities for young people. This work was aimed at facilitating the selection of the right job, expanding employment opportunities, improving consultation work, eliminating long-term unemployment through the application of advanced techniques, streamlining labor market programs, and preparing 200 professional and associated standards, 52 vocational profiles, and 43 modular training programs.</p><h4>How do foreign companies contribute to the training of the Azerbaijani workforce?</h4><p>Azerbaijan's economic achievements have made our country attractive to a foreign workforce. One of the objectives set forth by President Ilham Aliyev is to protect the domestic market from a non-qualified foreign workforce and make the best use of available domestic manpower. To this end, the country has been applying the labor migration quota in certain economic spheres since 2009. The construction of a platform for the Shah-Deniz II project, the operation of the existing oil and gas projects, the establishment of an Olympic Village for the first European Games due to be held in Azerbaijan in 2015, the renewal of road infrastructure, the construction of the White City residential settlement, the new international air and seaports, the petrochemical complex, and the Gizildash and Gazakh cement plants are among such major projects. At the same time, foreign companies active in the Republic of Azerbaijan are paying growing attention to the replacement of expatriate personnel with local staff, organizing the necessary training, and establishing partnerships with local partners and companies. For example, a number of projects have been carried out in conjunction with social stakeholders in the past three months. The State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR) has signed three cooperation agreements with BP, including the Protocol on Cooperation between SOCAR and BP in the area of the nationalization of personnel involved in the implementation of BP-operated projects, the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on cooperation between SOCAR and BP on the training of the national workforce at the Gobustan Regional Training Center, and the MoU on cooperation between SOCAR and BP in the area of training at Baku Higher Oil School. In addition, the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of the Population has signed a Memorandum on Cooperation with Akkord Industry Construction Investment Corporation and another Memorandum on Cooperation with Azersun Holding. The Ministry is expected to sign similar cooperation agreements with several other major companies in the near future.</p><h4>What will be the 2014 highlights for the Ministry?</h4><p>Our main objective at the current stage is to take advantage of the experience of developed countries in creating a modern social security system. To this end, the Ministry is expected to conduct major reforms. The planned institutional reforms and modernization of the legal framework will create more transparency and improve the quality and accessibility of the services provided to the population.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history behind Exact Invest?</h4><p>Exact was founded in 2005 by a Danish investment banker to provide capital for real estate projects, originally in Denmark. However, in 2007, due to market conditions in Europe, we decided to exit Europe and relocate to Brazil. We established ourselves in northeastern Brazil as a key capital partner for leading developers there. Then, in 2013, we decided to pursue business in Colombia.</p><h4>What is the investment philosophy behind your real estate fund?</h4><p>Our philosophy is to be extremely hands-on. Exact's background was in fundraising in a retail market, so we have over 200 private investors who want us to be hands-on and protect them against any downside. Our office in Brazil has 18 people full-time to manage roughly $100 million, which means that we have many boots on the ground managing a relatively small fund. That is an important part of our philosophy; to be much more involved in the project than a traditional fund manager. We want to be more of a developer than an investment bank.</p><div class="quote">“The local pension funds have increased their allocations toward local investment funds and hedge funds."</div><h4>How do you manage risks?</h4><p>For the investors in Denmark, we target annual returns of over 18%, and have been successfully achieving this for the past seven years. The way we look at risk mitigation specifically has to do with our involvement in projects and in applying best practices across them. Many people are involved in these projects, but we are not a passive investor. We participate in value creation when the project is defined, and actively protect the value, which is in the control and execution of the projects.</p><h4>What has driven the company's interest in investing in Colombia, and what is the Tunja project about?</h4><p>Generally, it was very clear to us that the next market in Latin America, after Brazil, would be Colombia. Mexico is another animal altogether, and the other big economy, Argentina, is not that interesting for Exact Invest. Chile is substantially developed, and it has large players and easy access to capital. With its growth, the middle class, and stability, Colombia was a clear next step following Brazil. Specifically, we saw in Colombia what we had seen in Brazil seven years before, namely the growing middle class, access to finance for property buyers, and a growing retail market. The reason we are in Tunja is that we want to be in several cities in Colombia. When we went to Brazil, we did not go to Rio de Janeiro or Sío Paulo; there were already large funds and public developers present. We did not want to be a small player in a large market, so we went to Fortaleza and, within seven years, we now consider ourselves the leading fund manager or capital partner for the development sector in that area. While we do want a presence in Bogotá and Medellí­n, we are very clear that we need to be in the intermediate cities and we want to create a foothold and presence there because that will position us as a leader for the next two decades. Tunja is a relatively small city of about 250,000 people, but there is not that much competition or international institutional capital there. Accordingly, we can position ourselves comfortably for the future, rather than getting into the areas where there is already heavy competition. We are also considering Cali and Barranquilla as two important intermediary cities in Colombia.</p><h4>Are you entering joint ventures or partnerships with local construction firms, brokers, or advisors?</h4><p>Exact Invest always wants to undertake projects together with a local developer. Our modus operandi is just as in Brazil, where we have the capacity to take a project from start to finish. We want to grow into that position in Colombia as well. However, even if we had the capability to do it alone, we always want a local partner. We enter joint ventures at the project level, where the developer and ourselves contribute capital and we develop the project together, with the developer being the operational  partner.</p><h4>What does the support of Denmark's Investment Fund for Developing Countries (IFU) mean for Exact?</h4><p>The move to Colombia was supported by the IFU, which is basically a Danish government fund. That has been very helpful to us, firstly in persuading other Danish private investors to join us, and secondly in attracting partners in Colombia. It is an attractive proposition to work with institutional or government money, along with which we also bring standards of sound business practice. We are closely focused on corporate social responsibility (CSR), pursuing the requirements for our partners; specifically at the project in Tunja, where we will be conducting CSR training to be financed by the Danish government. We will look at the environmental and social impact on the community, and will advise the developers in their processes to be able to identify CSR risk and mitigate it. It is an additional plus for our projects and partners that we are able to bring this to the table.</p><h4>What is the current composition of the office sector in Colombia?</h4><p>Developers have traditionally financed projects by pre-selling units, just as they do in the residential sector. The fiduciary system creates the opportunity for developers to construct and sell relatively large projects with relatively little equity. That then generates the smaller stratified offices, and now because there is a lack of larger office space, funds are going in and financing projects to meet that need. That is what is happening in the office and industrial sectors. Foreseeably, the next wave will be in the residential segment, which could include apartments for rent with a specific strategy, such as student housing or senior citizen housing. These strategies are seen in Europe and the US, but have yet to take hold here.</p><h4>What role do companies like yours play in attracting FDI to Colombia?</h4><p>I believe we are playing a role, although the investment fund or private equity sector is very underdeveloped in Colombia, and still in its infancy. In order to raise funds and deploy capital into projects, the funds are actively promoting Colombia to institutional and retail investors in Europe and the US. In our particular case, we spent two months talking to potential investors in Denmark to promote Colombia as an investment option. I think investment funds are doing a lot of promotional work to raise capital, and that will have a spillover effect on other types of FDI.</p><h4>What potential do you see in the new fiduciary regulations for Colombia's asset management industry to grow?</h4><p>The local pension funds have increased their allocations toward local investment funds and hedge funds. That opens up a market for funds like Exact Invest, or others that could be set up under the new rules. For instance, they are setting up a new investment funds structure that can be managed by fiduciary companies, whereby you can capture local pension funds. If that starts to work, the amount of capital flowing in to, for instance, the private equity real estate market could grow significantly. Right now there is relatively little capital flowing in. There are only a handful of large funds, and the amount of capital is not substantial. If the local pension funds can deploy more through new vehicles, it could have a major impact on the market.</p><h4>What is your opinion of the Colombian fiduciary model?</h4><p>I actually think it is a great system, and would go as far as to say that in the period from 2007 to 2009, Europe could have benefitted greatly from copying the Colombian system. For foreign investors and fund managers, it is now a standard and a prerequisite. We will not invest in a project where the cash flow is not managed by a third-party fiduciary, which gives a substantial sense of security.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you rate the performance of Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) in 2014 compared to last year?</h4><p>We're very proud of our performance in a number of key areas. Firstly, safety, where we recorded the lowest lost time incident frequency (LTIF) and total recordable case frequency (TRCF) on record. In process safety management and asset integrity, several assets reached calculative status, which is a high international standard of integrity assurance. On the production side, we also set new (combined oil and gas) records. We've continued to build oil production and to meet the increasing demand for gas. On the exploration front, notwithstanding more than four decades of drilling, we continue to have high success rates. The portfolio is of course getting more difficult; for example, we're getting into tighter, deeper gas developments, but we are highly encouraged by extended test results. On the well reservoir facilities management (WRFM) front, we continue to set the benchmark and have received much global recognition. Ultimately, it's all about the performance of the fields. You have to get the basics right and also successfully implement enhanced oil recovery (EOR) technologies. We have fields that are producing more today than they were 30 years ago, and there are very few examples of that around the world. Thanks to considerable well intervention and restoration work, we now have very low decline rates in fields that previously were subject to high decline rates. Project delivery is also getting stronger, while the exponential growth and challenge in our business, including water production, number of wells, and power requirements, means that driving lean and continuous improvement is a must do for longer-term success and to manage the transition from primary to secondary to tertiary production. So all in all, it was a good year, but there is no complacency and our focus remains on improving all parts of our business, including how we interact and support our contractor community. We are also continuing on our journey to gain UN Global Compact membership in 2014. We set that roadmap in 2010. It's not easy, but we've had global experts coming to see what we're doing, and they were truly impressed. We still have issues and challenges, sure, but we're fixing them with the aspiration to become a role model in sustainable development.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on the importance of technology and innovation as a key driver for your business?</h4><p>We operate in an increasingly complex environment that needs to rely on more efficient energy management and more advanced and efficient subsurface displacement mechanisms. We're reviewing, testing, piloting, and prototyping some 70 different technologies at any one time. Some of them work, some of them don't, while some of them go into full-scale implementation—it's a never-ending process. We work with a lot of different companies to help us manage some of the challenges we face. One such challenge is water management. PDO produces considerable volumes of water of different salinities. The Nimr reed beds project is a fantastic success, enabling us to handle more than 700,000 barrels of produced water, with a 98% reduction in energy use. We can't use that solution 100 kilometers south or north of Nimr because water salinities, and other contaminants, are very different.</p><h4>How much PDO production is from EOR, and how much of it will it account for in the future according to your estimates?</h4><p>At the moment, EOR projects account for about 12%-14% and, by 2023, will represent one-third of our total production, using thermal, chemical, or miscible gas injection recovery methods. We are currently reviewing 22 EOR project opportunities, four of which are under full-scale implementation, 12 that are in the pilot, design, engineering, or execution phase, and six under examination. Some will be canceled, but the vast majority will progress at a significant pace.</p><div class="quote">“We operate in an increasingly complex environment that needs to rely on more efficient energy management."</div><h4>In 2013 you initiated a new project to produce steam from solar energy as a potential substitute for gas. How successful has this technology been and will you use it in the future?</h4><p>That pilot was extremely successful. It exceeded our expectations not just in terms of the effective and efficient delivery of quality solar steam, but also in terms of reliability and operability. One of the challenges of using solar applications in the Middle East is the high temperatures combined with the dust, wind, and humidity, which essentially coats the solar panels, reducing their overall effectiveness. PDO joined forces with Glasspoint to deliver a very different scheme with an effective (glasshouse) cleaning mechanism, one that was both simple and highly efficient. Now we have a very viable alternative, and we'll be having discussions with the Board about expanding this project. It was one of the largest pilots in the world, and it's going to get much bigger.</p><h4>How is PDO managing the increasing demand for gas, and why is the resource a priority for the country?</h4><p>Gas remains a key and strategic fuel for today and the foreseeable future. It's cleaner, more reliable, and more efficient than oil-fueled energy. Power and desalination plants, energy exports, and domestic industrial expansion are all largely driven by fuel-gas. On the supply side we're trying to explore, connect, deliver, and compress as much gas as possible in a cost-effective way. On the demand side, we're not just a large energy supplier, we're also a significant energy user, for instance for thermal EOR processes that are fuel-gas intensive. As a result, we place huge emphasis on energy optimization, indeed as much as we do on energy exploration. In 2012-2013, our process engineers reduced gas consumption by as much as was found by our exploration teams. Conserving gas creates considerable value along with the opportunity for redeployment for other industrial and development purposes and is achieved through the installation of combined-cycle power plants, waste-heat recovery systems, reduced distribution losses, more efficient turbines, and gas break-through controllers, not least the water and solar management projects previously referred to.</p><h4>To what extent does PDO place importance on in-country value (ICV) in Oman?</h4><p>On ICV, PDO is a strong and active player in Oman, and what we set as a standard tends to be followed by others. We're very proud that, in October 2011, under the auspices of the Ministry of Oil and Gas, we received full support for our ICV strategy and roadmap, which has since become the industry's roadmap, and the ICV acronym is now used as a common term across every publication and every engagement, every day. We're just going to do more and more of what we've been doing, creating jobs and development opportunities. On December 18, 2013, we got together with the Ministry of Oil and Gas, the Oman Society for Petroleum Services (OPAL), and other operators and reviewed 53 categories amounting to more than $100 billion worth of investments by 2020. A number of ICV project categories that we addressed a year ago were recently awarded. For instance, we used to service equipment, pumps, and electrical devices in Jebel Ali, and beyond, and now those services are available locally. Turnaround has improved dramatically and we have established a capable Omani workforce in the process. Whether they stay with PDO or move to other businesses, they've been up-skilled, trained, and can setup their own SMEs in servicing and support. We set ourselves a target in 2011 to create 1,000 jobs per year covering the manufacture and servicing of goods, and have exceeded this target by a factor of four. Maybe forging parts doesn't make sense, but perhaps installation does, and if that doesn't hold true, then we move on to the next stage in the value chain to see if we can service it. It's not just about Oman, but also about how we can help channel supplies in the region. Oman may not necessarily provide a sufficiently large local market for a new strategic investor in a particular specialty area, but it'll need a skilled local workforce. We are therefore also working very hard to align Oman's vocational training programs with the needs of industry. We work closely with the Minister of Manpower and we review how to up-skill, train, and target new sectors. Each month we're targeting a new sector and a new skill.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the oil and gas sector in Oman in the coming decade?</h4><p>It is very positive. We get strong support from the Ministry of Oil and Gas. We have more and more operators, including small and medium scale, and this shows that the sector continues to be an attractive area of investment. On the exploration front, we continue to be successful and our portfolio of projects is very significant. However, there are opportunities also for smaller players, they are able to develop and enhance production from smaller opportunities and turn them into profitable ones. So I think the will is there, the potential is there, and there are great companies like PDO to make it all happen.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Who are your main partners here in Abu Dhabi and what competitive advantages do you realize through them?</h4><p>Our most important partner is the government itself, represented by the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC). Partex has been here since the very beginning; we were pioneers in the oil and gas industry in the Middle East. Our founder, Calouste Gulbenkian, was a key player in the creation of the Iraq Petroleum Company, which pioneered the oil and gas industry in the Arabian Gulf region. Partex has a unique feature in the industry; we belong to a foundation. In practical terms, that means that our profits revert to the foundation and its objectives. Our profits revert to the benefit of mankind because the aims of our foundation are art, science, education, and charity. For that reason, we are not a major player, but we play a major role in human development. On the other hand, we are not constrained or under pressure from the stock market and shareholders. We consider ourselves independent and reliable. We do not compete with the majors, but we are free to challenge them whenever necessary. Gulbenkian was highly skilled in bringing different interests together and reaching compromises for the benefit of everybody. We pride ourselves on fulfilling and maintaining that role. At Partex, we try to help governments in the countries where we operate and safeguard and promote their interests. We cooperate actively in the development of the country and the people. Partex has agreements with other foundations and institutions; in Abu Dhabi we operate closely with the Petroleum Institute (PI), and students from the PI go for summer internships at our head office in Lisbon. In R&amp;D, we develop our own niches, and we apply the results of our research in the petroleum industry, usually in the areas of reservoir engineering, seismic inversion, and reservoir simulation. In addition, we open our doors to nationals from the UAE to participate in our research activities.</p><h4>One of the ways you conduct R&amp;D is through the universities. What new innovations is Partex bringing to the market?</h4><p>We believe that education is a key area, and look to encourage as much synergy as possible. Partex often works in cooperation with Portuguese universities and other institutes, such as the ISQ in Portugal. The ISQ is a quality certification institute, and we have been cooperating with it for 40 years. We avoid duplication and competition where we can get synergy. One example that comes to mind in a niche area is a project we have on microbial enhanced oil recovery (MEOR). There are certain types of bacteria that can break down the molecules of very heavy oil. Heavy oil is hard to extract from a reservoir unless you heat it up with steam, which is what they do in Oman, or you break up the oil molecules and make it more fluid and easier to extract. We have conducted extensive researched in this area and found out what kind of bacteria is appropriate for different types of oil, as well as how the bacteria behaves. It is easy to see how the bacteria behave at 25 degrees centigrade and 1 bar pressure, but if we are talking about 70 to 100 degrees centigrade and 100-bar pressure, it is another story. Some can and some cannot survive, and that is the essence of the research. We are still in the research phase, but we are progressing. Another project we have is a specialized algorithm for reservoir simulation. In simple terms, it is technology for analyzing seismic data. What we do is use the algorithm we developed and try to replicate seismic data from wells that are already known. If we match that simulation with the reality, then we can apply the simulation in other places to improve the recovery factor in the field or assess and optimize where to drill wells. We have done a study for this here, at ADCO's Bu Hasa Field, where we were shareholders, and it improved the recovery factory. We did a similar study with Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) in Oman with good results. If a field has a reservoir of 4 billion or 5 billion barrels, and we improve the recovery factor by even 1%, this represents an additional 40 or 50 million barrels. That adds up to a considerable amount of money for a relatively small amount that we spent on the study.</p><div class="quote">“We believe that education is a key area, and look to encourage as much synergy as possible."</div><h4>Regarding the end of the 75-year concession agreement, how do you see the negotiations going on right now?</h4><p>The negotiations have been taking place over a few years, and we are ready to continue. Nevertheless, the government took other factors into account and, of course, we respect that. Two days before the concession ended, we had a meeting with all of the shareholders and the government and we said we are willing and ready to continue. We are maintaining our cooperation with ADNOC, and we offered a proposal for a joint co-operation agreement, which is being discussed as we speak. We were invited by ADNOC to nominate candidates for positions there, and one of them was successful. We wish to continue working in Abu Dhabi, and hopefully we will be part of the new ADCO. Partex was not invited to the first part of the process of the negotiations when the government invited the majors to submit technical proposals. We hope that the government will see that as well as needing the majors, it needs some of the smaller companies to maintain the balance, which is the role we have been playing for 75 years. Of course, there are other fields in the UAE that may represent good opportunities. And we are present in GASCO. In Oman, we renewed the concession for another 40 years, and 10 years have already passed. In the oil industry, you always have to think in terms of the very long term because of the huge investments involved. That is why we cannot feel hurried.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did AZ-GRANATA expand its international presence in 2013?<br></h4><p>We saw a fantastic period of growth in 2013, with a 157% increase in export sales, more than tripling our target. For a beverage company this marks healthy growth that gives us hope for further expansion and diversification within our segment. Currently, we are exporting to 22 countries worldwide including the US, the UK, Germany, the CIS region, the UAE, and 15 other European countries. And in 2014, we are set to commence exports to Canada, Sweden, Israel, and China. Aside from this, AZ-GRANATA is fully determined to extend its operations beyond Azerbaijan and expand its beverage distribution to Georgia and Kazakhstan. The impressive potential for growth in beverage consumption and lower distribution costs are the driving factors of our interest in these markets. We also proudly offer Vita1000, Azerbaijan's top-selling juice brand that holds a 23% share in the fruit juice market. With a strong domestic presence and export potential, AZ-GRANATA has set a path for its long-term, ambitious growth target of doubling revenue by 2018.</p><h4>AZ-GRANATA was awarded for technological innovation at Prodexpo in 2013 for its new Leyli juice. To what extent do you rely on innovation in your growth strategy, and what other products are you looking to launch?</h4><p>AZ-GRANATA's dedication to constant innovation has allowed us to perform effectively on an international level. Currently, Leyli is the best-selling and only BIO freshly squeezed pomegranate juice brand in the Russian market. By using the best ingredients, modern technology, original design, and practical packaging, we launched an optimum-quality product. Leyli also captures important consumer trends, as it promotes a healthy lifestyle and good eating habits. This combination has made the brand uniquely successful, having become the number one pomegranate juice brand in Russia by surpassing established Armenian and Italian brands within a short period of time. Another huge international success came last year when we launched premium juice brand +More. The brand was highly acclaimed for its creative packaging and won silver nomination at the Pentawards 2013 annual packaging design competition. No other brand from Azerbaijan, or the CIS region, has ever achieved such worldwide recognition. We are planning to introduce bottled water, tea, and lemonade products to our portfolio. By the end of 2014, AZ-GRANATA will have renovated and expanded its winery, doubling production capacity. Therefore, innovation will continue to foster greater success going forward, and is the only means of realizing AZ-GRANATA's ambitious growth targets and export expansion.</p><h4>How do you ensure that AZ-GRANATA's products are organic and meet the highest standards of quality?</h4><p>AZ-GRANATA has over 1,500 hectares of fruit orchards, which, along with related processing and farming methods, are frequently inspected by international and local specialists. Our products have been certified as organic by the German Lacon Gmbh institute. We also operate a USDA organic, kosher, HACCP system and hold 22000:2005 accreditation from Global Group.  Over the past few years, AZ-GRANATA has invested in building drip water irrigation systems and taken extra steps to increase productivity and ensure organic standards.</p><h4>How important are pomegranates in Azerbaijani culture and agriculture?</h4><p>Pomegranates and the products derived from this fruit are famous for their healing properties. The tradition of pomegranate use in Azerbaijan goes back to the ancient times. Pomegranate and Narsharab have been famous in Azerbaijan for many centuries. It is a ubiquitous element in our cuisine. Azerbaijani pomegranates have a magnificent taste and guaranteed quality, which gives us a firm competitive advantage in the global market. Nevertheless, we think there is a further need for promotion at the international level. Therefore, we have committed to researching this area and promoting “Made in Azerbaijan" pomegranate products worldwide.</p><h4>How does AZ-GRANATA select the location of its plantations, and what regions in Azerbaijan are benefitting the most from your presence?</h4><p>AZ-GRANATA has fruit orchards in Agsu, Shamakhi, Astara, and Lankaran, where we grow pomegranate, grape, peach, feijoa, orange, lemon, kiwi, and other varieties of fruits. The total area of these orchards is 1,500 hectares and AZ-GRANATA employs 1,490 people across four regions. Since increased production is one of our foremost goals, plantations are chosen according to their proven fruit productivity levels.</p><h4>How does AZ-GRANATA ensure adequate employee training levels?</h4><p>Overall, our beverage companies and fruit orchards employ 1,840 people. AZ-GRANATA annually participates in over 10 international beverage fairs such as Berlin Green Week, Nuremberg BIOFACH, and Gulfood Dubai. AZ-GRANATA has a capability manager that deals with the specific skill development needs of its employees, and we conduct training several times during the year. Twenty finance and accounting employees receive semi-annual training in international accounting and reporting principles. And over the summer, workers have a full month in which they work with agricultural experts from Turkey and Israel. Engineers from our plant have also benefitted from exchange visits to internationally renowned beverage operations such as Döhler in Germany and Gat in Israel. Almost all managers at AZ-GRANATA are either trained or educated abroad. They are fully equipped with modern tools and skilled in the use of cutting-edge technology and farming methods.</p><h4>In addition to your role in creating employment, how does AZ-GRANATA contribute to community development?</h4><p>The arrival of AZ-GRANATA has created broad economic opportunities for farmers by removing obstacles to market access. Previously, many farmers had failed to bring their fruit to the market due to geographical obstacles and high costs of delivery. AZ-GRANATA supports local farmers by purchasing their crops at a fair market price. Additionally, the presence of AZ-GRANATA also means better-skilled human capital in the regions, and the wider transfer of agricultural knowledge and technology. We believe that such contributions definitely have an encouraging effect on the development of regions and local communities.</p><h4>HE President Aliyev won a third victory at the polls in October 2013. What do you expect his third term to bring in terms of economic growth, and particularly in agro-industrial growth?</h4><p>President Aliyev attended the AZ-GRANATA opening ceremony in 2012 and strongly encouraged us to focus on exports and the human development of the regions. Accordingly, we have benefited from his vision to increase exports, reduce import dependency and serve consumers by producing high-quality products. We have witnessed a decade of major investments, infrastructure projects, regional development, strong macroeconomic stability, low inflation, a stable currency, and firm economic growth in Azerbaijan. President Aliyev's leadership and will to change the country for the better was the overriding factor in this enormous success. It further encourages us to invest in regional development. The coming years will be more successful for the economy of Azerbaijan. The Baku 2015 European Games (with a pomegranate-shaped logo) will be helpful in promoting our image abroad.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In our last interview, you said that you were trying to turn AzerNews into a leading source of information in the South Caucasus and even the Middle East. What achievements has the newspaper made in this regard?<br></h4><p>It was a challenge for me as an editor, and I am very pleased to have made huge progress in this regard. As a first step, I redesigned the print and online versions, making them more aesthetically pleasing. We have added more relevant content, exciting stories, and analytical articles about the ongoing economic and political developments in the region, as well as exclusive interviews and opinions. I would like in particular to emphasize the new columns, which have more exciting stories. We have also created travel and event sections, taking into account the interests of our readers and business partners. Now, we are receiving a number of letters from around the world about the touristic potential of Azerbaijan. We are partnering with dozens of international companies to render media support to world-scale events. And that does not only cover the South Caucasus and Middle East, but also Europe and Central Asia.</p><h4>What are you doing to expand your online activity?</h4><p>Expanding our online activity and strengthening social media connections still remains at the top of our development agenda. The replies, sharing, retweets, and likes that our content receives on popular social networks allow us to say that we are becoming more popular on social networks. That also helps us to get to know and meet the needs of our readers. For example, we know very well that photos of interesting places in Azerbaijan, and in particular the capital Baku, attract much attention. Our articles enjoy popularity not only among our Azerbaijani audience, but we have regular visits from users in different countries, with the top 10 including the US, the UK, Canada, Turkey, Russia, Germany, and France. This is a very important indicator for us. It means that we reach an audience of people around the globe that attach importance to, and are interested in, news and analytical articles from reliable sources on the ongoing developments in the Caspian, Caucasus, and Central Asia. It is no secret that mobile devices are leaving PCs behind in terms of their popularity. People who possess smartphones and tablet computers read news articles online. Over the past few months, we have observed a rise in incoming visits to our website from mobile devices. We will continue working hard on the usability of our website and its mobile version to make it more convenient for our readers to access our articles.</p><h4>The regions of Azerbaijan are fast gaining an international profile. For example, Gabala was the Capital of Culture for the CIS in 2013. How important are the regions in your news coverage?</h4><p>Azerbaijan possesses nine out of the 11 climatic zones, which makes it attractive to tourists all year round. Coverage of regional news and places of interest will definitely raise the interest of our foreign readers in the regions. We can see this in the number of e-mails that we are receiving from people desiring to visit the country. Moreover, we have recently begun a travel column, which is designed to guide tourists visiting Azerbaijan. Many Azerbaijani cities are now developing and becoming international centers. You mentioned Gabala, but I would also like to note here another ancient city, Nakhichevan, the central city of Azerbaijan's Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic, which will become the Capital of Islamic Culture in 2018. Our newspaper covers regional events on the national and international stage in the political, business, cultural, sport, and environmental fields, and more. The development of ICT in Azerbaijan has also enabled us to considerably increase the number of our online readers in the regions. Alongside that, the printed version of the AzerNews newspaper has subscribers around the country—it is distributed in Baku and regions by a local company. That is why we have good reason to cover all the regions of the country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the Ministry's main accomplishments in 2013, as far as improving the quantity and quality of medical services and infrastructure are concerned?<br></h4><p>Extensive work is underway to upgrade healthcare infrastructure and improve the material and technical offering of medical institutions. A total of 81 medical facilities were built and renovated in 2013 alone. Of these, 43 are located in Baku and 38 in other regions. A further 56 medical facilities were renovated in the same year. In addition, the Baku Health Center has been built and fitted with the latest medical equipment. Traditionally, the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev attends the opening ceremonies of major medical facilities, including the Baku Health Center, the Surgical Clinic of the Azerbaijan Medical University, Sumgayit City Hospital No. 1, and the central hospitals of Astara, Agjabadi, Jalilabad, Lankaran, and Yevlakh Districts. The volume and quality of services provided to the population has dramatically improved. At the same time, the effectiveness of hospitals has also risen. In 2003, the average hospital bed was used for just 82 days; in 2013 this figure has risen to 249 days, which represents a three fold increase. The number of patients applying to in-patient and out-patient clinics has also risen by 65%. Additionally, the development of strategies for dealing with such priority fields of medicine as oncology, renal insufficiency, diabetes, thalassaemia, hemophilia, infant and mother mortality, and immunoprophylaxis have been instrumental in expanding the volume and improving the quality of medical service. A total of AZN80.1 million was spent as part of these programs in 2013 alone. The treatment of patients suffering from these conditions has produced positive results. In the past 10 years alone, the mortality rate of thalassaemia has dropped to a fifth of what it was, and that of diabetes and tuberculosis has diminished by a factor of 2.6. Deaths as a result of hemophilia have been halved.</p><h4>How is the Ministry working to promote maternal and child healthcare, and what have been the major advances in this area in 2013?</h4><p>The improvement of the quality of mother and child services represents one of the priorities of the country's social policy. And the national strategy, which involves providing newborns with electronic health cards, and is working on developing immunoprophylaxis, has been a success. A number of important activities were undertaken in 2013 to resolve problems related to the organization of antenatal services and pregnancy hospitalization. To this end, the Ministry has adopted a number of documents regulating the activities of medical facilities in this area. One of the existing problems has been the gradual increase in the number of Caesarean operations in recent years. Certain amendments have been introduced to the laws to prevent such operations in the absence of medical problems. Also, the Ministry of Health has outlined a guideline named “Medical Conditions for Caesarean Operations," and has agreed on a clinical protocol for such surgery. The material and technical infrastructure of medical institutions providing mother and child health services has improved, and this field is receiving more medicine and equipment in recent years. In 2003, the infant mortality rate in Azerbaijan was 16.7 per 1,000, but this figure dropped to 10.8 in 2013. Maternal mortality has dropped from 18.5 per 1,000 to 14.5 over the same period.</p><h4>This year was designated as the Year of ICT by the current administration. How is technology being used to promote better healthcare in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>We are working hard to introduce state-of-the-art information technologies to the healthcare system. First of all, the system of electronic health cards for citizens has been developed and introduced, and there are currently 11 registers for different diseases. In 2013, the Health Ministry introduced a total of 28 electronic services provided through the Ministry's website. A system of electronic control over the activities of medical institutions and centralized recruitment of medical personnel, along with an electronic system for monitoring infectious diseases and the circulation of medicines, an ambulance dispatcher service, and other electronic programs have been commissioned.</p><h4>How is R&amp;D progressing in the medical sector?</h4><p>Medical institutions in Azerbaijan have a total research and educational staff of 2,700 people, including 12 members of the National Academy of Sciences, 171 professors, 261 doctors of medicine, and over 1,200 PhDs. More than 120 doctoral theses and over 600 PhD theses have been defended in Azerbaijan over the past 10 years. In 2013, the scientific research institutions of the Health Ministry completed nine important projects covering different spheres of medical science.</p><h4>Today, the pharmaceutical sector is dominated by foreign medication. In your opinion, what are the prospects for the development of the sector and of domestic pharmaceutical companies?</h4><p>Since domestic medicine production is practically absent in our country, more than 99% of the local demand is met by imports. There are 70 distributors, dealers, and other organizations engaged in the wholesale trade of pharmaceuticals, and around 1,800 pharmacies in Azerbaijan today. The state register of medicines approved by the state currently includes over 4,000 drugs. Proper provision of the population with medicines and state oversight in this area are crucially important. Taking into consideration the vital social role of this issue, the Ministry has joined forces with several other government agencies to introduce the state regulation of prices on pharmaceuticals.</p><h4>What do you expect will be the most important initiatives your Ministry will undertake in 2015?</h4><p>The implementation of the state program on the compulsory medical examination of children will be continued. This is evidence of the importance the government attaches to the protection of children's health. The state program on oncology is also scheduled for adoption in 2014. In addition, according to the “Azerbaijan 2020: Outlook for the Future" development concept, the state program on improving mother and child health over the period from 2014 to 2020 and a strategy for fighting non-infectious diseases in Azerbaijan will be adopted. Also in 2014, the National Thalassaemia Center is expected to complete preparations to begin bone marrow transplantation operations in Azerbaijan.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The government designated 2013 as the Year of ICT in Azerbaijan. In light of the year's developments, how has the educational system benefited from the increased use of technology?<br></h4><p>In 2013, which was declared the Year of ICT in Azerbaijan, the integration of ICT into the educational system became an integral part of the Ministry's Action Plan. Throughout the year, the improvement of ICT logistics in educational institutions, including the provision of computers and other necessary digital equipment, was carried out as in previous years. Procurement contracts for educational institutions on the provision of ICT equipment were signed. As a result, secondary schools and other educational institutions subordinated to the Ministry of Education were provided with thousands of new devices and gadgets, including desktop and laptop computers, projectors, and smart boards. Additionally, educational institutions were provided with intranet services and access to the internet. Furthermore, a further 70 educational institutions joined the Azerbaijan Educational Network, and, in total, 1,695 educational institutions were provided with constant intranet and internet connections. In 2013, in accordance with the implementation principles of e-government, activities were implemented to create a database of diplomas and a centralized diploma-verification portal for the Ministry of Education. More than 5,000 pedagogical, administrative, and technical staff of the education system were trained in the effective use of ICT in education.</p><h4>What efforts is the Ministry making to increase the percentage of practical training and hands-on experience in the curriculum?</h4><p>International experience demonstrates that vocational education and training (VET) is a success when based on an experience-centered approach. This approach allows vocational training facilities to provide learners with respective qualifications by offering them theoretical knowledge via flexible education programs and then putting them through real-world work experience. Analysis of existing educational programs indicates that, depending on the length of study, some 40% to 60% of academic hours in the VET schools are assigned to work experience. This is not a small figure; in fact, the main problem lies not in the quantity of academic hours assigned to the improvement of practical skills by students, but in the ineffective organization of the process in question. Along with real-world work experience, it is important to create appropriate conditions enabling students to master practical skills during the time they spend in a VET school. Thus, a student should already be equipped with certain practical skills by a VET school before advancing in the industry. With this view in mind, opportunities to master practical skills are being expanded for students through the establishment of modern training facilities and resource centers together with the employers and international organizations and with public funding under the framework of the Contemporary Azerbaijani Professionals project by the Ministry of Education. Under this project, resource centers were established at VET schools in partnership with interested foreign counterparts, both public and private. The newly established resource centers provide a platform for learning new professional skills, which are in great demand in Azerbaijan's labor market. Preliminary results show that the conditions created in vocational education institutions attract a greater number of youth, where they obtain a real opportunity to secure employment using skills acquired in VET schools. For instance, we intend to equip several of our VET schools with agricultural machinery and vehicles. The last time vocational education institutions were provided with agricultural equipment was back in the Soviet era. A graduate will face challenges to find a job if they lack operational knowledge of modern equipment and machinery. Preparing competitive human resources by improving the material and technical basis and professional level of teaching staff will remain a priority in 2015.</p><h4>Could you share your views on the importance of educational exchanges between Azerbaijan and other countries?</h4><p>As in every other sphere of life, education needs to be integrated globally in order to be efficient. A flow of students between countries establishes an efficient learning platform. International education creates an environment of cultural understanding that exposes students to new and alternative approaches to learning, thinking, and understanding. Azerbaijani students study abroad and obtain high-quality education and new skills, returning as young professionals. Since the outset of the implementation of the state program on education for Azerbaijani youth abroad 2007-2015, which was launched upon the initiative of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev, so far 2,612 Azerbaijani students have been granted full scholarships to pursue their higher education at leading higher education institutions around the world. They study various majors from medicine to engineering, tourism, information technology, economics and agriculture; all fields which have been identified as a priority for Azerbaijan to sustain its economic development in the mid- to long-term perspective. The government of Azerbaijan covers all of their expenses, including tuition, accommodation, insurance, visa fees, travel, and book expenses during the period of study. The only obligation upon those students is that they return to Azerbaijan and work in the field of their specialization contributing to the further development of their nation. In this manner, they enjoy a sense of joint ownership in the future of our country. This state program is one of the core initiatives inspired by the philosophy of turning black gold into human capital. It is also one of the very few such mechanisms existing in the world today where a government invests significant funds in the education of its citizens at foreign universities.</p><h4>How would you evaluate Azerbaijan's cooperation with international institutions like UNESCO and UNICEF to promote child and youth rights and opportunities?</h4><p>While implementing its development strategy in the field of education, Azerbaijan pays particular attention to strengthening cooperation with relevant international organizations, including UNESCO and UNICEF. Our country collaborates with these organizations on various issues, in line with our national strategy of education development, for example the use of new information and communication technologies in education, development of vocational education, child protection reforms, and the process of deinstitutionalization, as well as the implementation of joint projects on UNESCO-associated schools and the establishment of UNESCO chairs in our higher educational institutions. The vivid example of the commitment of Azerbaijan to further develop its cooperation with UNESCO, as well as its efforts to support the activities of this organization in the field of education, science, and culture worldwide, was the signing of the Framework Agreement between the government of Azerbaijan and UNESCO on cooperation in the field of education, science, culture, and communications. Along with cooperation links, the agreement stipulates the establishment of a Trust Fund to which Azerbaijan contributed $5 million with the aim of assisting UNESCO in strengthening its work in the promotion of education, cultural heritage, science, and innovation technologies worldwide. When speaking about UNESCO-Azerbaijani cooperation, it is important to focus on activities carried out by the Heydar Aliyev Foundation so ably led by the First Lady of Azerbaijan, UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador Mehriban Aliyeva. The Heydar Aliyev Foundation plays an innovative role in reinforcing the UNESCO-Azerbaijan partnership through initiating and implementing large-scale programs in Azerbaijan and abroad.</p><h4>How can education help to serve the purposes of economic growth and development for Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Today, we are proud of the fact as a result of the economic reforms and the oil strategy launched in 1994-96 upon the initiative of Heydar Aliyev, the National Leader of Azerbaijan, for the last few years Azerbaijan has been consistently topping the international growth ratings composed by such institutions as the World Bank and the IMF. However, we also know from history that sometimes it is harder to sustain growth than to achieve it. To achieve this, the economy of Azerbaijan, both in the public and private sectors, needs thousands of well-educated managers and professionals, who know how modern economics functions and how global economic trends change. Their knowledge and skills will help Azerbaijan to avoid the so-called “Dutch Disease," efficiently use the record-high revenues generated by energy resources exports to strengthen the non-oil sector, and develop industrial, agricultural, tourism, and other spheres of activity. This will secure Azerbaijan's position in the world, and in our region particularly, as well as increase the competitiveness of our economy, and raise the living standards of our citizens. With this in mind the government of Azerbaijan is investing heavily in education, including scholarships to study abroad. We have no doubt that these investments will turn out to be the most efficient ones, helping to transform our natural capital into human capital.</p><h4>What educational areas is the Ministry looking to promote over the coming years?</h4><p>The Ministry of Education does not discriminate between areas of education. Considering the fact that all areas are interrelated, a complex approach and the coherence of reforms are crucial. We cannot prioritize pre-school over general education, or promote higher education while neglecting vocational training. The Ministry plans to implement reforms in every area of education considering the key provisions of the state strategy on the development of education, which was officially approved by Ilham Aliyev, President of the Republic of Azerbaijan, in October 2013. However, it is also important to note that at each level of education, we have to re-think existing formulae, and promote efficient new approaches that improve the quality of education. Content, educators, infrastructure, management, and financing education are major pillars of the state strategy regarding the reforms to be implemented across the different levels of the education system. The development of content assisting the education of skillful and responsible citizens, training educators to deliver content, and promoting autonomy for educational establishments, while increasing the level of accountability, improving transparency, building efficient quality assurance systems, restructuring the financing of education, and other similar actions will be the key issues promoted by the Ministry.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the mission of Kaspi Education?<br></h4><p>Private education plays a substantial role in the development of human resources and in the overall economic growth of developed countries. Kaspi Education strives to offer top-quality services to Azerbaijani citizens across various age groups. We are proud to serve over 4,000 citizens annually with language training, study abroad services, executive education, pre-school preparation, and the preparation of students for local university through centralized admission exams. The company's central mission is to serve the nation by offering high-quality education services using innovative teaching methods.</p><h4>What services does Kaspi Education offer?</h4><p>The center was established in 2007 as a language training school offering private tutoring in various languages. The major aim of Kaspi Poliglot is to provide language training for university students, recent graduates, young professionals, and other people interested in learning foreign languages. In order to fulfill its objective of providing premium-quality services, the company has established strong partnerships with major UK-based language schools. Cooperation with esteemed education providers such as INTO, the London School of English, and English in Action has enabled the company to apply modern teaching methods in language training. As a result, interest in Kaspi Poliglot's services from various private companies, government institutions, and the general public has rapidly increased. We are proud to have been involved in a number of major projects in Azerbaijan, including the provision of language training for 300 policemen as part of the official preparation for the Eurovision 2012 song contest. In addition, every year Kaspi Poliglot provides language training for 50 journalists in Azerbaijan with the financial support of Azercell. We also serve a number of corporate clients to enhance the language skills of their staff members. Within a short time frame, the founders of the center decided to expand the company's activities by establishing services for preparation for higher education. The declining quality of teaching in Azerbaijan's secondary schools has created serious problems for students in state-administered admission exams. Kaspi Abituriyent developed a special program that reviews the content of the secondary school curriculum, helping students to achieve high scores in state exams. The 94% university admission rate indicates the success of the Kaspi program. The principal methodologies applied include the continuous assessment of student achievements, close communication with parents, and internal competition among students through various contests and innovative strategies for taking exams. In 2013, two Kaspi Abituriyent alumni achieved the top scores in the country and received the Presidential Stipend, indicating the efficiency and effectiveness of our methodology. Within five years, we have assisted more than 1,000 students in gaining admission to Azerbaijan's top universities. Kaspi Education Center supports various state programs by enhancing education opportunities for Azerbaijan's youth. The government program for enhancing study abroad opportunities for Azerbaijani youth inspired us to launch a new branch of the business. Kaspi Global, which provides study abroad services for Kaspi Education Center, was established in 2009. Partnership with leading international universities has been the major priority of Kaspi Global since its inception. Kaspi Global was the first private education provider to organize the International Education Fair in Baku in November 2009. Since then, six such fairs have been organized. More than 15 educational institutions representing universities from the US, Australia, the UK, Switzerland, and other European countries took part in our first fair. Over 2,000 Azerbaijanis had the opportunity to find out about various study abroad programs offered by high-ranking universities. The University of Glasgow, University of Sheffield, University of Exeter, University of Newcastle, the University of East Anglia, and many other institutions are currently key partners of Kaspi Global. We assisted over 120 Azerbaijanis to gain admission to foreign universities. Moreover, the majority of Kaspi Global students also received government funding for their undergraduate and graduate programs. The most recent innovation of Kaspi Education Center is Kaspi KIDS, which is for pre-school age children. Kaspi KIDS aims to prepare pre-school age children for primary school by providing adequate training on general study and social skills, as well as reading, writing, mathematics, and foreign-language skills. Parents can also choose from a wide range of courses such as dance class, additional foreign languages, painting, chess, and gymnastics. Kaspi KIDS has a unique preparatory program designed to enhance children's memory, logic, social, communication, and problem solving skills. We believe that pre-school preparation lays a solid foundation for personal development and facilitates further stages of education. Currently, we serve more than 600 children in Baku and Sumqayit, and we plan to expand our activities to other regions of Azerbaijan in the near future.</p><h4>What key characteristics of Kaspi Education differentiate you from your competitors?</h4><p>Accessibility and affordability are the key features of Kaspi's services. To cover the suburbs of Baku, we operate in five different locations around the city. The current branches of the center are located in the Ahmadli Settlement, and the Khatai, Narimanov, Yasamal, and Sabunchi districts of Baku. Soon, two more branches will begin operations in Baku. The regional targets of the center include branches in Ganja, Sumgayit, Mingechevir, Lankaran, Shaki, and Guba. Prior to launching a new branch, we carefully research the local market and its needs, as providing services that are compatible with local needs is the trademark of our success. Customer care, communication with parents, the involvement of esteemed education experts in the development and improvement of the services, and strong media connections, as well as cooperation with state authorities help us to close the gaps identify, and provide high-quality education services. We also provide a number of merit-based scholarship opportunities for young people with special talents. Some Kaspi students are fully funded for tuition fees, while others receive partial scholarships for study at various levels. Finally, Kaspi Abituriyent offers monthly gold, silver, and bronze prizes for students with the highest performance indicators. We believe that creating a competitive environment in education is a key driver of success for students, as well as for the company.</p><div class="quote">“  Accessibility and affordability are the key features of Kaspi's services. "</div><h4>The impact of ICT on society is growing swiftly nowadays. How does Kaspi Education reflect these changes in its services?</h4><p>Kaspi Education places great importance on the application of ICT in education and works to create and apply innovative electronic resources in learning. In 2013, Kaspi launched a nationwide online TV program dedicated to education services: www.oxu.tv. The online services provided by the site are free and accessible by any internet user. The main goal of the project is to provide video classes for the secondary school curriculum aimed at pupils in Azerbaijan. The video programs will cover all subjects between first and 11th grade of the secondary school program. The classes are taught by experienced and successful teachers awarded by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Azerbaijan. So far, more than 300 video lessons on different school subjects have been prepared and provided for audience access. Students can watch classes missed due to illness, or else the videos can serve as a revision aid for difficult subjects. We also believe that the materials can help parents to understand the content of the curriculum and become involved with homework preparation. Finally, the site provides a distance-learning opportunity for students living in rural areas of the country, or those with physical disabilities. We believe that oxu.tv makes a significant contribution to Azerbaijan's education community. Besides, in cooperation with the Diaspora Committee we have prepared a game-based online learning resource for young people aged from five to 10 years to learn the basics of the Azerbaijani language. What is more, Kaspi  Education has prepared a Learning Management System (KaspiLMS) that enables any educational organization to manage the education process and possess regular control over the quality of the education provided. Kaspitest.com is another electronic source created by Kaspi that provides online mock exams for Abituriyents in a real regime. Kaspi Education Center has a very ambitious mission: to provide high-quality education services for every Azerbaijani citizen. We believe that education is not only about knowledge, but also values and culture, and is a key component of national development. Education is the major driving force of prosperity and positive change in society. Through the application of our innovative and modern methodology, we strongly believe that Kaspi Education will become one of the key agents of change in Azerbaijan.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the highlights of 2013 for the Association of Football Federations of Azerbaijan (AFFA)?<br></h4><p>Azerbaijan has undertaken many important initiatives with a view to developing football and international relations over the past year. AFFA gained noteworthy success in such fundamental spheres as education, infrastructure, and sports. We are proud to say that our national team gained nine points during the qualifying round, which is the highest score received by the “A" National Team in its history until now. However, we are trying to improve our results every year. A friendly match between famous world football veterans and football veterans of Azerbaijan was organized by AFFA on the 90th anniversary of the national leader Heydar Aliyev. The football stars who attended the match also took part in other events. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) awarded AFFA with the Women and Sport Achievement Diploma in recognition of the work done by AFFA in the development of women's football. The UEFA Pro Coaching Course organized for the first time in our country has been successfully completed too, and specialists who concluded the course were awarded certificates. A groundbreaking ceremony of a new training site to be constructed for Azerbaijan National Teams with the participation of UEFA President Michel Platini took place in Mardakan at the AFFA Football Center. President Ilham Aliyev invited Platini to exchange ideas regarding the development of football in Azerbaijan. The European Championship 2020 will take place not in one country, but in 13 cities. Baku city nominated itself to host one or more of the tournament games, and its nomination had been approved by UEFA. President Aliyev signed a decree to participate in the bidding process and prepare the Euro 2020 Baku Bid Book. AFFA also started cooperation with such influential companies in the country as Bakcell, Hyundai, and Atena. To ensure the popularization of football in the country, AFFA and Bakcell started a joint project called Football with Bakcell. Six talented children were chosen to participate in a training camp that took place at Denstone College in the city of Manchester during the Summer Soccer School of Manchester United Football Club that took place in Baku. The UEFA Executive Committee chose Baku as a host city for the UEFA Futsal Cup Final. We are currently in the intense preparation stage for this event. There are many people working for the development of football in AFFA under the leadership of Rovnag Abdullayev.<br></p><h4>Over the past year, AFFA has collaborated with Manchester United, Bakcell's partner, on a number of events. What are the benefits of this collaboration?</h4><p>We are pleased that influential companies in Azerbaijan are eager to contribute to the development of football and collaborate with us. Bakcell, one of the leading mobile operators in the country, is ready to support local football. As part of our cooperation, the construction of a modern stadium named the Bakcell Arena was initiated in the eigth kilometer district. We also successfully implemented the “Football with Bakcell" project. At the same time, Bakcell cooperates with the English club Manchester United. The Manchester United Summer Soccer School was organized in Baku within the framework of this cooperation.</p><h4>Considering the success of the country's U-17 and U-19 teams and tournaments. How does football contribute to the positive development of Azerbaijani youth?</h4><p>Besides other age groups, AFFA also organizes football leagues for young players under 17 and 19 years old. First and foremost, this gives an opportunity for teenagers and youth within this age group to play football professionally. Obviously, not all young players participating in these leagues will choose professional football careers in the future. Some of them will acquire other professions. One of the reasons we organize these leagues is to promote a healthy lifestyle among teenagers and young people, and to ensure that they avoid acquiring harmful habits. This goal is one of the fundamental elements of a healthy society.</p><h4>Azerbaijan is preparing to host the first European Games next year. What role do you expect football to play in this event and how are you preparing for it?</h4><p>Azerbaijan and its capital Baku have been presenting themselves as a venue for numerous international tournaments, championships, and licensed Olympic competitions. Baku is considered as one of the sports centers of the world.  We are proud that the opportunity to host the first European Games was given to Baku. In this prestigious event, football will be represented by beach soccer. Azerbaijan has been taking important steps toward the development of beach soccer since 2008. The Azerbaijan Beach Soccer National Team has successfully performed in European and World Championship qualifying rounds, and we hope that our Beach Soccer National Team will also gain successful results during first European Summer Games and will share its victories with us.</p><h4>AFFA is also preparing to organize a large-scale sporting event of its own in 2016: the U-17 UEFA Championship. How are preparations for this event going?</h4><p>In 2012, Azerbaijan hosted the FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup. In the words of FIFA President Joseph “Sepp" Blatter, the tournament was written into the history of football as one of the best world championships. The Turkey UEFA Executive Committee made a decision to conduct the UEFA U-17 Championship in Azerbaijan, which is an honor but also a responsibility. We are working in this direction. UEFA has put its faith in us, so we have to justify this trust by all means.</p><h4>How do sports events promote a positive image of Azerbaijan abroad?</h4><p>Azerbaijan is developing at a rapid pace. Few countries can compete with our pace of development. There are sport centers of an Olympic standard in almost every region. Through our international tournaments, we allow people to see how organized and developed the country is, and these events not only improve the level of sports, but also the infrastructure of the cities in which tournaments take place.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the development of Azerbaijani sport during President Aliyev's third mandate?</h4><p>The President has always approached sports with special attention and concern. The national sports strategy was developed under his personal supervision, and the success of these policies is borne out by victories at the Olympic Games and at other international championships. The President of the Republic promulgated the State Program for Football Development in 2005, and AFFA has diligently followed this to develop football in the country. President Aliyev always takes part in the ceremonies and inaugurations of stadiums and venues, and he participated in the opening and closing ceremonies of the FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup. The increasing number of Azerbaijani athletes who win medals at the Olympic games also indicates the success of the government's work in this sphere. We are confident that Azerbaijan will continue to surpass itself in all spheres, including sports, and that our country's name will always be among the winners under the leadership of President Aliyev.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the highlights of 2013 for Jumeirah Bilgah Beach Hotel, and how did the hotel fare in terms of customer number of turnover?</h4><p>During 2013, we hosted a number of cultural and trendsetting events, such as the Polo World Cup, while also hosting a number of international celebrity performers and DJs, and many local artists at our unique outdoor venues and state-of-the-art conference facilities. The aim for 2014 is to continue delivering on our brand promise of remaining fresh and ensuring that we extend memorable experiences to each of our guests. During 2013, we had a high number of local guests as well as visitors from Russia and other neighboring CIS countries. We saw growth both in terms of revenues and the number of guests from these markets in the vicinity of 30% over the peak summer period compared to the previous year. We are looking forward to continuing this growth in 2014.</p><h4>Could you talk about the Sirius reward and loyalty program and its performance in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Sirius is Jumeirah's Recognition and Rewards program. It was created to offer exclusive membership that opens up a world of privileges to our loyal guests. It is available at every Jumeirah Hotel, Resort, and Residence around the world. Sirius was designed to reward our guests when they stay, dine, relax, or shop at Jumeirah Hotels and Resorts. A high number of Azerbaijani guests participate in our loyalty programs, and the Azerbaijani market is of great importance for Jumeirah properties around the world.</p><h4>Azerbaijan is to host the first European Games in 2015. How is Jumeirah Bilgah Beach Hotel poised to benefit from this event, and what preparations are you making for it?</h4><p>We are perfectly positioned to benefit to the maximum from the games. Well located for the airport, we are in close cooperation with the Organizing Committee and expect quite a few events to be held at our establishment. During the European Games 2015, to be held from June 12 to June 28, 2015, Baku is expecting a high number of visitors. The athletes meanwhile, will stay in a newly built “Games Village." We aim to accommodate athletes' families, sponsors, and general sports fans from all over Europe coming to Baku to watch the inaugural games. Moreover, our perfect location close to the newly built Olympic Stadium and the airport, we believe, renders us a likely venue for the organizing committee to plan events and accommodate guests during these games.</p><h4>Given your experience of hotel management, how would you evaluate the availability of trained staff in Azerbaijan's hospitality sector?</h4><p>As a matter of fact, we are still witnessing the development of the Tourism Industry in Azerbaijan, and young Azerbaijanis are still progressing through the ranks. I believe that all five-star hotels are still facing a shortage of professionals in this field and have no other choice than to invite colleagues from neighboring countries. There are initiatives underway to establish a number of Tourism &amp; Hospitality Vocational Colleges, and in the near future we will see many more trained professionals from Azerbaijan holding senior positions within the Hotel Industry.</p><h4>What are your expectations regarding the development of luxury tourism in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Azerbaijan has primarily been recognized for its rich energy resources and business opportunities in the oil and gas arena. It is, therefore, highly encouraging to see the world visit Azerbaijan for wholly different purposes; hence, the progress and development of the tourism sector. Obviously, Baku is at the forefront of this for all the above-mentioned reasons, One notices investment entering the region, which is highly promising for all involved. A few years ago, one would not have thought of visiting Azerbaijan for a luxury skiing holiday, but which today is a reality.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-flame-game]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the hotel performed since its inauguration in June 2013?</h4><p>The hotel was inaugurated by the President himself, ensuring significant public interest from the outset. We opened with a restaurant, a bar, and around 150 rooms, and in the first few days we staged numerous events. We have recently been opening other parts of the hotel, such as a second restaurant and a jazz bar. At the very top, namely floors 30, 31, and 32, there will be a restaurant and lounge, making for a highly elegant venue with beautiful views and a modern conceptual design. We have just a few more floors to complete now, but the early days have been highly promising, and we have developed a solid reputation for services, food, and high-quality facilities.</p><h4>How do you see the development of MICE tourism in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>The group has six five-star hotels in the city. We have some great venues, like the Baku Crystal Hall, which hosted the Eurovision Song Contest, and the Heydar Aliyev Center, which is an amazing establishment. There are a number of other venues here, like the Baku Expo Center, which are all large enough to host major events. I think the time is right now, while Baku is on the map through these various international events, to really start promoting it as a MICE destination. For one, hoteliers have combined resources with the Ministry of Tourism and Culture to develop a Baku Convention Bureau, which opened in September of 2013.</p><h4>What makes the Fairmont stand out from the competition?</h4><p>Firstly, it is a highly iconic property. You can see the Flame Towers from everywhere in the city. We have one of the largest rooms in the city, at 1,000 sqm, and can host 1,000 people at cocktail receptions and 650 for dinner. In that respect, it is a very large venue and all our other rooms range from 10-20 people up to 300. This provides considerable flexibility in terms of staging conferences or ancillary events. The sheer flexibility, our service standard, the iconic building itself, and the proximity to ministries and government institutions are all unique advantages for the hotel.</p><h4>How will the hotel serve as an entertainment center for locals?</h4><p>We will have seven restaurants and bars on site, so I expect people to come and sample the variety. We have the first French restaurant in a hotel in this city. We also have the first jazz bar in a hotel. There will be an upmarket steakhouse serving good, fresh meats from various parts of the world, as well as fresh fish from all over the world, which is unique too. People can basically come to the hotel and try different restaurant every night. Also, we will host guests visiting the city for shopping as once the complex is finished, there will be a shopping center here with 70 stores, a further 10 restaurants and bars in the shopping complex, the country's first IMAX theater, an office tower, and a residential tower. People will basically visit for a multitude of reasons. I believe that for locals, we represent variety and elegance. You will be able to visit for an afternoon, evening, or a whole day and indulge in a multitude of activities within the same complex.</p><h4>When will the complex be completed?</h4><p>By May 2014, the hotel should be completed in it entirety, with the exception of the upper level restaurant, which we have yet to finalize. We are hoping to open the shopping center by October. The office tower should open for business in the first quarter of 2015, and the residential tower by the end of 2015.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Gabala's role in Azerbaijan's history?</h4><p>Gabala is an ancient Azerbaijani city. For almost 900 years, it was the capital of Caucasian Albania. The city has distinctive traditions that have come to shape the way its residents live and work. In 2013, following the decision made by the leaders of the CIS countries, Gabala was declared the Cultural Capital of the CIS. The inauguration celebration was held in August 2013.</p><h4>What is the potential for Gabala to become a regional tourist destination?</h4><p>Gabala is located in the mountainous north west of the country, a region known for its impressive agricultural fertility. It boasts breathtaking views, rendering it a perfect tourist destination. Today, it has 16 hotels, of which four are five-star establishments. Meanwhile, there is a new ski resort in Tufandag, and Gabala International Airport, located 22 kilometers away from the city center, assists with transfer to the resort, receiving regular and charter flights. Tufadag Resort offers extreme sports facilities, with rafting being just one. Meanwhile, soccer enthusiasts take advantage of  numerous football pitches. All sports facilities meet the highest quality standards, and in 2013, we added to the overall offering by opening a new golf course, while a hippodrome is currently under construction.</p><h4>What role will sports play in Gabala's development?</h4><p>New sports facilities provide youth with physical recreation opportunities and adults with employment. The results of our focus on sports are noticeable, reflecting in decreased levels of crime and drug abuse in Gabala. We also have a football academy under construction that will bring the area much welcome value. Another important asset is a college of tourism and travel industry that will add to the growing body of industry professionals.</p><div class="quote">“  The biggest canning factory in the region is located in Gabala, and produces goods for export to 30 countries. "</div><h4>To what extent are you trying to position Gabala as an international events venue?</h4><p>In the summer of 2014, Gabala will host its sixth International Classical Music Festival. The festival, organized by the Heydar Aliyev Foundation, brings together the world's leading classical musicians. The festival, running from July 20 to August 6, is broadcast worldwide, and also features a young musicians contest to showcase fresh talent. Apart from the cultural festivals, Gabala has been hosting an international art festival for four years now, which invites participants from the US, Japan, China,  South Korea, and some European countries. Our city also hosts high-level international political events, such as the summits of the Cooperation Council of Turkic Speaking States. The local authorities have embarked on developing Gabala as an event hub of the region. Meanwhile, the new Heydar Aliyev Congress Hall is the latest in building technology. Baku is a highly crowded city, which suggests that increasingly international meetings will be held in Gabala, which I believe could become a second Davos. Gabala was appointed as The Capital of Legends of Azerbaijan for 2014 by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism.</p><h4>In addition to tourism, certain sectors such as agriculture and industry are showing promise. What are you doing to promote them?</h4><p>Currently, there are many industrial plants being built in the region. The biggest canning factory in the region is located in Gabala, and produces goods for export to 30 countries, including the US, Japan, and European markets. There are also hazelnut processing facilities in Gabala, where products are exported to Germany and Italy. Aside from that, we have wineries, and others under construction. Gabala also hosts the only piano factory in the former Soviet countries. Furthermore, there is a construction material factory among Gabala and these plants ensure a high regional employment rate. To date, the unemployment rate in Gabala has been close to zero. In fact, Gabala-based enterprises employ both locals and Azerbaijanis from other regions. Meanwhile, agriculture and animal husbandry are growing concerns, and two modern animal husbandry facilities were opened in 2013 with 1,200 livestock apiece.</p><h4>What are your plans for Gabala for the years of 2014-2015?</h4><p>We have ambitious plans for the next few years. And as we expect the number of tourists to increase, we have embarked on constructing two additional hotels. We also plan to open a new hospital in 2014 as well as a branch of the Foreign Languages Institute and a training center. It is worth noting that the population of the Gabala region continues to grow due to sustainable regional development. Over the past three years, it has grown from 93,000 to over 100,000 people.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Azersun has been around for over 20 years. What would you say has been the company's trajectory to date?</h4><p>The company has been around for more than two decades, during which time numerous changes have taken place. It is particularly gratifying that these changes are for the better. A highly competitive market has emerged in Azerbaijan over the years. This, in turn, has paved the way for the production of goods that would be competitive in foreign markets. The development of Azersun is closely intertwined with the development of Azerbaijan as a whole.</p><h4>How would you describe the role Azersun has played in the development of the private sector and business environment in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>As one of Azerbaijan's first private companies, Azersun has played a tremendous role in private enterprise development. By putting high-quality and affordable products on the local market, Azersun has set an example for other companies to follow. Over the years competition in the market has only intensified, as all companies strive to meet customer demand in a more efficient manner. This is a win-win situation for the country's private sector and consumers.</p><h4>What are the company's plans for the future?</h4><p>Azersun Holding has very ambitious plans for the near future. Major steps are being taken in Azerbaijan these days to improve the wellbeing of the population. We are creating jobs. There is extensive state support for private enterprise development in the country. Azersun Holding exports its products to different countries around the world, thus promoting Azerbaijan internationally.</p><h4>What are the key management principles for Azersun?</h4><p>As in all major companies, Azersun Holding has its own regulations and charter. The company is also managed in accordance with the requirements of Azerbaijani national legislation. Our guiding principle is to create pleasant working conditions for our staff. Our top priority is to ensure the safety of our personnel and live up to their expectations. Many of the specialists currently working in major companies in Azerbaijan have attended the school of Azersun.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Azerbaijan has come into the limelight in recent years thanks to the large-scale cultural and sporting events it has hosted. As the future host of the first European Games in 2015, what does the future hold in store in terms of its tourism development and international prestige?<br></h4><p>The European Games in 2015 are forecast to be a mega-event with over 14,000 people visiting as part of teams and game crews alone. Therefore, we are intensely concentrated on this event in terms of logistical support, accommodation, promotion, and marketing. Meanwhile, we are aware that the Ministry of Youth and Sport is pursuing other opportunities in international sports that could potentially be hosted in Baku. As the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, during 2014 we are set to host events including the UNWTO European Commission Meeting and Advisory Forum of the Enlarged Partial Agreement on European Cultural Routes.<br></p><h4>BakuTel, the largest ICT conference and exhibition in the Caucasus, took place in December 2013 at the Baku Expo Center. How does Azerbaijan rank as a destination for business travel and the prospects for the MICE industry?</h4><p>MICE is considered to be one of the key tourism segments for Azerbaijan, with about 30% of tourists visiting the country for the purposes of business or participation in events. In light of this, we established the Azerbaijan Convention Bureau (AzCB), which became fully operational as of September 2013, having already actively attracted events to Azerbaijan. It has extensive plans for further development, primarily via membership of ICCA and participation at two major MICE fairs: IMEX and EIBTM in 2014.</p><h4>In addition to domestic activities, what is the Ministry doing to promote Azerbaijan as a tourist destination in other countries?</h4><p>There is a wide spectrum of activities ranging from participation in international tourism fairs to advertising on international TV channels, such as CNN, Euronews, TV 5 Monde, and others, as well as coverage in publications and major periodicals. However, we expect 2014 to be somewhat different, as we have developed a formal marketing program for the 2014-2016 period, having significantly reshaped our marketing and promotional budget. For instance, in this period we plan to place greater emphasis on e-marketing and the establishment of tourism representative offices in Russia, Germany, and potentially Turkey. Work schedules are in place for budgets, as well as detailed plans of action for each market, concentrating on both B2B and B2C activities.</p><div class="quote">“  MICE is considered to be one of the key tourism segments for Azerbaijan. "</div><h4>What efforts is the Ministry making to ensure sustainable development of the tourism sector?</h4><p>We are improving the legislative base and industry standards to enhance quality and safety. We have developed a professional marketing program for the next three years that works toward the improvement of public-private partnerships (PPPs), while supporting professional tourism associations.</p><h4>What are your views on Baku's potential to become the cultural capital of the Caucasus?</h4><p>In many ways, Baku already is a cultural capital, as a regional center of cultural and religious dialogue. It is a meeting place of cultures and religions within the context of the International Intercultural Forum, along with the annually held International Humanitarian Forum, International Theaters Forum, and many other events. This has given rise to the official term “Baku process," which encapsulates Baku's leading role in intercultural dialogue.</p><h4>What major cultural and tourist initiatives can be expected to take place in Azerbaijan in 2014-2015?</h4><p>There are several international tourism forums that we expect to host in 2014. Yet additionally, there will be several traditional events, including the Gabala International Music Festival, the Baku Jazz Festival, the Rostropovich Festival, and several other events of international and domestic significance that create an excellent foundation for cultural development and build bridges through culture.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Azerbaijan is preparing to host the first ever European Games, a multi-sport event for European athletes, in 2015. How are the preparations for the event progressing?</h4><p>Azerbaijan has never been so successful in sports as it is today. Through the decree of the President of Azerbaijan, the year 2012 was declared as “The Year of Sports" in Azerbaijan. At present, Azerbaijan is known as one of the strongest and most successful sporting centers. Despite being a small country, it has managed to host some of the largest international sport competitions in the world. Furthermore, the improving performance of Azerbaijani athletes at the Olympic Games illustrates the interest and attention to sports in our country. For example, at the Beijing Olympics, Azerbaijan was represented by 44 athletes in 11 disciplines, while four years later, at the London Olympics, it was represented by 53 athletes in 16 disciplines. Our Olympians won two gold, two silver, and six bronze medals, which was a record in the history of Azerbaijani sports. Another important sporting event is the Third Islamic Solidarity Games, where Azerbaijan was placed seventh out of 46 countries. Our athletes won a total of 24 medals, including six gold, nine silver, and nine bronze medals. Baku bid to host the Olympic Games in 2016 and 2020. And while it fulfilled all requirements, our candidacy was not accepted. However, it didn't affect our efforts and attempts for future preparations. The experience obtained during this period will create new opportunities for the next stage of our candidacy. Moreover, it was a chance to present Azerbaijan to other countries. Meanwhile, the developing national economy, as well as improvements in the area of sport, creates a great opportunity for the preparations. The experience gained has also inspired us to promote Azerbaijan for the 2024 Olympic Games. The European Games will be a multi-sport event for elite athletes from the 49 Olympic nations of Europe, and will be held every four years. The Games are owned and regulated by the European Olympic Committees (EOC). With Baku 2015 expecting around 5,600 competitors across 18 sports, the 2015 European Games is set to be a major event in the international sporting calendar.</p><h4>How will the hosting of this event, as well as other large-scale sporting events, benefit Azerbaijan's youth as far as job creation and participation are concerned?</h4><p>The host city's preparations are on schedule, with construction and structural planning for many of the 21 stadiums and facilities for the Baku 2015 Games already well advanced. Venues for Baku 2015 will include the iconic Crystal Hall, which hosted Eurovision 2012, a new National Aquatics Centre, and a modern, multi-purpose 65,000-seat stadium. The construction of the Athletes Village is also highly advanced, and already regarded by experienced games planners and consultants as one of best accommodation and preparation facilities ever provided for elite competition athletes. Other landmarks, such as the Flame Towers and the Heydar Aliyev Cultural Center designed by Iraqi-British architect Zaha Hadid, will provide a spectacular backdrop for the events. The people of Baku and the whole of Azerbaijan are looking forward to welcoming athletes, officials, media, and spectators from across Europe. Our aim is to demonstrate the warmth and hospitality of Azerbaijan, the host city and its people, and to show what we have to offer as a new destination for sport, business, and tourism. Working with the EOC and sporting federations, we will showcase sport in new formats and settings and put the European Games on the world stage, heralding a new major sporting and cultural event. Events confirmed for Baku 2015 include established Olympic sports such as swimming, diving, cycling, boxing, and gymnastics, as well as new formats for sports such as basketball 3x3 and beach soccer, providing an exciting blueprint for future major sporting events.</p><h4>How do you expect sports to advance the economic development and reputation of Azerbaijan internationally?</h4><p>At present, there are 40 Olympic sport centers across Azerbaijan and 35 have been built over the past decade alone. The main purpose of this strategy was to inspire the younger generation invest their free time in sports activities. The Azerbaijani population has over 9 million people, 31% of whom are classed as young. A healthy, strong, and educated youth is the powerhouse of any country. Moreover, the opening of these complexes creates a major opportunity for the country to hold international competitions not just in the capital, but also in the regions. Sporting facilities are not only built in the large cities, but also in villages and small towns. Several vital elements need to be ready for the Olympic Games. Currently, the Gymnastics Complex is being constructed. This complex will enable the country to host various international sports competitions in Baku. At the same time, the Republic Sports Center is also being constructed in Baku, which will make sure athletes have access to comprehensive medical services. I would add here that construction of Baku's Water Sport Palace has also begun. One of the most important achievements of the last year was the reconstruction of the nation's largest sporting arenas, namely the Republican Stadium named after Tofig Bakhramov. During recent years, we have given special attention to the construction of swimming pools and chess schools. The first European Games will be a major opportunity for our country in terms of displaying hospitality and professionalism. Indeed, the EOC has  evaluated Azerbaijan's preparation for the Games very highly. Obviously, we realize the responsibility and difficulty of such an endeavor, but is only strengthens our resolve to perform perfectly.</p><div class="quote">“  A healthy, strong, and educated youth is the powerhouse of any country.  "</div><h4>What other international sporting events will be held in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>We are determined to construct a diversity of sports centers and facilities. By the time of the opening ceremony, all construction will have been completed. International TV channels will also be licensed to broadcast the event. These games will, therefore, create major interest in the culture and tourism potential of Azerbaijan. The government's sport strategy is aimed at presenting our country to the world as one of the most welcoming, comfortable, and prominent, and as a reliable figure in major international events. In an historic moment for the Olympic Games, Azerbaijan will hold the first European Games in 2015. In 2017, we will be the center of the Fourth Islamic Solidarity Games. Moreover, the Chess Olympiad 2016 and Chess World Cup 2015 are to be held in Baku. Consequently, all previously mentioned construction projects create a wide picture of sporting interest and attention in the country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Gabala Shooting Club has just turned one year old. Could you tell us about the reasons that led to the foundation of the club and its performance thus far?</h4><p>The first stage of the Gabala Shooting Club (GSC) was inaugurated in February 2013. The inauguration was attended by President Ilham Aliyev, who commended the efforts made and suggested possible future developments for the second stage of the club. GSC is situated in the fast-growing city of Gabala, a historical center in Azerbaijan, and is part of the Gabala Sports Club, a world-class facility that prepares the national teams of Azerbaijan in shooting, boxing, taekwondo, karate, soccer, and judo. The reason behind building the GSC was to develop a multi-purpose and world-class shooting facility in Azerbaijan that can serve both as a recreational and entertainment center, and as a training place for the national shooting team and international professionals. In its day-to-day activity, GSC engages with various state institutions such as the Gabala Sports Club, the Azerbaijan Shooting Federation, and the International Shooting Sports Federation, among others. It prepares the national team and the reserve team of Azerbaijan, trains teenagers at its shooting school, organizes training camps and competitions, and cooperates with the media to publicize its events and raise awareness about shooting as a sport. The founding of the GSC came at a time when sports in general are experiencing a heyday in Azerbaijan thanks to the government's focus on promoting them on all levels. These days, Azerbaijani athletes are winning victories in international competitions, and new sports facilities are being built all over the country. Sports play an important role in the country's development strategy, as they contribute to the formation of healthy and ambitious young generations. The fact that President Ilham Aliyev is also the President of the National Olympic Committee of Azerbaijan is telling of the special role of sports on his agenda. Nowadays, Azerbaijan, a country of nine million people, boasts 41 Olympic-level complexes in different regions. In the words of President Ilham Aliyev, “Azerbaijan is recognized worldwide as a sports-based culture. As the country is successfully hosting international sporting events and its athletes are winning victories abroad, we are sure of the potential of sports in Azerbaijan and its contribution to the development of future generations." Incidentally, our Club President, Tale Heydarov, supports the government's efforts to promote sports in Azerbaijan and to put Azerbaijan on the map as a country of excellence in sports.</p><h4>What is the role of shooting in Azerbaijan's sports-based culture?</h4><p>Shooting is one of the 80 fields of sport practiced on a professional level, and is one of the 40 sports that host international competitions in Azerbaijan. Azerbaijani shooting has a great track record, seeing how we had a gold medalist at the 2000 Sydney Olympics and a bronze medalist at the 2004 Olympics. Some of our athletes went on to train important teams abroad. While shooting is perceived as an elite sport, it is also a recreational one, and Gabala Shooting Club tries to combine the two types of shooting by providing facilities for both.</p><h4>What do the club's facilities consist of?</h4><p>The club provides ideal conditions for tourists, recreational shooters, and professionals. Thus, it is endowed with archery halls, five combined shooting ranges, nine sporting ranges, as well as ancillary facilities such as paintball, a training hall, a conference room, a press center, a VIP area, restaurants, a photo studio, a daycare center for children, and parking facilities. Furthermore, GSC enjoys a privileged position in Gabala, a fast developing tourist destination, in which cultural sights, hotels, amusement parks, entertainment options such as river rafting and the Tufandag ski resort can be accessed within a radius of a few kilometers. The Club also provides sporting and hunting equipment for rent or sale. Our store distributes famous sporting and hunting rifle brands, such as ARMI Perazzi, Castellani, Armeria Piovanelli, and La Porte, Beretta, and RC, among others. At the club's facilities there is a shooting school, which at the moment trains 45 teenagers, 19 of whom are girls, in rifle, pistol, and shotgun marksmanship. The goal of the school is to attract more teenagers to this sport, promote a healthy lifestyle from a young age, and open up opportunities for the younger generations, because the teenagers we train are potential members of the national reserve team. Their trainers are professional shooters who have participated in and won international competitions. All in all, the Gabala Shooting Club is among the top complexes of its kind in the world, a fact that was confirmed by the Vice-President and Secretary General of the International Shooting Sport Federation (ISSF) during his visit to the club. The club's equipment is imported from France, Switzerland and Italy, and its 52-hectare area offers optimal conditions for anyone seeking to practice shooting at any level.</p><div class="quote">“  One of the purposes of the complex is to host large-scale shooting events. "</div><h4>What major events will GSC host in the coming years?</h4><p>One of the purposes of the complex is to host large-scale shooting events. For the time being, its plans are to host part of the Heydar Aliyev International Grand Prix in August 2014 and World Cup Finals for rifle, pistol, and shotgun in October 2014. Furthermore, the club will also host a World Cup for rifle and pistol, and shotgun in 2015, in which more than 2,500 athletes are expected to take part and will give 34 athletes the chance to win a license to qualify for the Summer Olympics in Brazil in 2016. Hosting this event is of major importance for us, because it is the first time in Azerbaijan and Gabala history that we will be hosting international shooting competitions, and this will happen at our club.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What new projects are you working on at the moment?<br></h4><p>One of the most important projects we have completed recently is the Tufandag ski resort in Gabala, the first stage of which was inaugurated by President Ilham Aliyev on January 3, 2014. When the second stage of the project is finished, the resort will boast eight slopes, with the highest peak at 2,450 meters. In 2013, we also took over a hotel that had already been built in Gabala, which we named Qafqaz Yeddi Gozel, bringing the total number of hotels we operate in Gabala at the moment to six. These hotels are Qafqaz Resort, Qafqaz Riverside, Qafqaz Sport, Qafqaz Karavansaray, Qafqaz Yeddi Gozel, and Qafqaz Gabala City. In November 2013, President Aliyev also inaugurated a four-star hotel in our portfolio, Qafqaz karvansaray. At the moment, there are three five-star hotels in Gabala, one four-star hotel, and two three-star hotels with a total capacity of over 1,800 beds. The Qafqaz Group has 10 hotels in Azerbaijan at the moment, in Baku, Gabala, and Lankaran, and is working on opening five more by 2015. Two new destinations we are seeking to cover in the coming year are Lenkaran and Yengija, where we are building a 60-room hotel.</p><h4>What are you doing to promote Gabala as a tourist destination and to attract visitors to Azerbaijan in general?</h4><p>We contribute to this goal in different ways. First of all, we are developing the tourist infrastructure of Gabala. In addition to the six hotels we operate there, we built an amusement park called Qabaland. We have also started the construction of a large, enclosed aqua park, right in front of Qabaland. We are planning the construction of another hotel, a 220-room, three-star hotel, which will be located beside the aqua park, and which is scheduled to open in 2015. Moreover, we are planning a golf resort approximately two kilometers from Qabaland. In June 2014, we are aiming to open a boutique mountain resort hotel in Tufandag with 50 to 52 rooms. Furthermore, we participate in the largest tourism fairs in the world, such as the ITB in Berlin and FITUR in Madrid, where we represent not only Qafqaz Hotels and Gilan Tourism, but also Azerbaijan and Gabala. We also establish international partnerships whenever possible to promote ourselves and our tourist destinations abroad and benefit from the know-how developed in other countries. For example, in order to improve the ski center in Gabala, we contracted the services of the TTI tour operator in Turkey, which has visited the resort already and with which we are working on finalizing an agreement. We have already opened a branch of Gilan Tourism in Egypt, which we are hoping will act as a bridge to attract tourists from Egypt and other Arab countries to Gabala. Furthermore, we have a very good partnership with Kuwait-Azeri, a company that brings groups of tourists from Kuwait to Azerbaijan. For example, we are expecting two groups of 317 tourists in total from Kuwait to visit us in April and May 2014.</p><p>The Gabala region has a rich history and beautiful nature, but more infrastructure is needed to make it into an attractive tourist destination. Right now, we are working to attract tourists, particularly from the GCC region, on hunting trips to Gabala. I believe that, in a short time, Gabala will become internationally recognized as a tourist destination. In early 2014, we met with the Committee of the European Games and reached an agreement to host the incoming athletes and visitors, which guarantees us a 70% occupancy rate during the games in 2015.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are KPMG's current and future plans in Azerbaijan?<br></h4><p>KPMG International is a global network of professional firms and one of the world's leading providers of audit, tax, and advisory services. We operate in 155 countries and have more than 155,000 people in all member firms around the world. KPMG has been working in Azerbaijan since 1998, and we entirely re-energized our office in 2011. We have more than 80 people, and today we are really proud to employ the best and brightest professionals from the energy, banking, and construction sectors, among others. Our essential principle has always been to use the network's global intellectual capital, combined with the practical experience of our local professionals. In terms of future plans, we see tremendous opportunities in the development of management consulting, in particular the optimization of business processes, IT advisory, and corporate finance services.</p><h4>What do you think are some of the best investment opportunities in the capital markets in Azerbaijan at the moment?</h4><p>Debt instruments have always been attractive in Azerbaijan. Annual interest rates in Azerbaijan currently vary from 2%-3% on sovereign debt securities to 8%-9% on term deposits in local banks. For example, commercial banks accumulated about $8.5 billion of term deposits in Azerbaijan as of March 1, 2014, which is an historic record for our country. Such a significant concentration of term deposits in banks is an indication of an increasing trust in the banking system of Azerbaijan, but at the same time it is also driven by limited number of alternative investment opportunities in our country, particularly public debt and equity instruments.</p><h4>What are the regulatory requirements for an initial public offering (IPO) in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>The State Securities Committee of Azerbaijan regulates the emission and sale of ordinary shares in Azerbaijan through the Baku Stock Exchange (BSE). The Committee is in process of facilitating regulatory changes to the securities market under the ongoing Capital Markets Modernization project, which we expect to boost stock exchange transactions in Azerbaijan.</p><h4>To what extent are Azerbaijani companies ready to go public?</h4><p>An IPO is not only about raising capital, it is more about institutional development and wide-scale changes to business administration from people, processes, and technology perspectives. In other words, an IPO journey starts from internal changes for any company. Such changes are, but not limited to, financial transparency, effective corporate structure, strong equity story, reliable internal controls, and risk management, as well as financial and IT systems. We observe Azerbaijan companies having a clear understanding of the necessary changes and a strong willingness to implement those changes.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What prompted you to found the Association of Journalists from Islamic Countries and what are its goals?<br></h4><p>While Western countries have numerous journalists' associations, these are lacking in Muslim countries. This prompted myself and prominent philologist and journalist Sona Valiyeva to found the association. The organization has several goals, the most important being to unite journalists in Islamic countries and to develop journalism by encouraging dialogue. Azerbaijan is central to the Muslim community and is a model of moderate Islam. It lies at the border of Europe and Asia, meaning it is in a privileged location and makes it an ideal country to promote dialogue between East and West. I consider it problematic that, nowadays, events in countries such as Iraq or Iran are only reported on by Western European or US sources, which can sacrifice objectivity and even accuracy. Our aim is to address this lack of communication by promoting objective news reporting in these countries. Journalists have the power to shape public opinion, which is why developing journalism in our countries is important.</p><h4>What progress have you made in setting up the Association?</h4><p>We are still in the early stages, and recently registered with the Ministry of Justice. We are also looking to attract influential journalists from other Islamic countries in order to set the tone for the dialogue we intend to promote.</p><h4>What is Azerbaijan's role in the community of Turkic countries?</h4><p>Azerbaijan was always a role model for the Turkic states of the former Soviet Union. For example, it was the first Turkic country to switch to the Latin alphabet from the Arabic alphabet in 1926, a gesture intended to facilitate integration into the global community. At that time, all Turkic countries, as well as Turkey itself, were using the Arabic alphabet. And after 1937, all countries in the region were obliged to switch to the Cyrillic alphabet. Meanwhile, Azerbaijan was the first democratic republic in the region, and one of the first countries in the world to elect women to parliament, in 1918. Azerbaijan was the only Turkic country during the Soviet Union period where Russian was not the official language.</p><h4>How significant is Azerbaijan's approach to Islam?</h4><p>Azerbaijan has time and again proven its moderate approach to Islam. For example, while the depiction of the human face was banned in most Islamic countries, it has been allowed in Azerbaijan since the 16th century. Furthermore, the focus in Azerbaijan has always been on culture, as exemplified in 1908 with the composition of our first national opera. We have a long history of cultural tolerance, which can serve as inspiration to other Muslim countries. Furthermore, Azerbaijan's foreign relations are highly diversified, as it reaches out to Muslim countries in North Africa, the CIS, and the Middle East.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Sumgait Chemical Industrial Park (SCIP) will be one of the largest industrial complexes in the Caucasus. What progress has been made on SCIP's development?<br></h4><p>Azerbaijan has the potential to become an exporter of petrochemical products owing to its large transport infrastructure network and rich hydrocarbon reserves. For this reason, one element of the successful socioeconomic policy carried out by President Ilham Aliyev is aimed at the development of the non-oil sector. Such measures as the reconstruction of industrial enterprises based on innovative technologies, modernization, and the creation of new industrial complexes are taken to accelerate the development of this sector. One of the steps taken in this sphere was the establishment of the SCIP in the territory of Sumgait pursuant to Decree No. 548 dated December 21, 2011 from the President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev. This allowed for the creation of favorable conditions for the development of competitive industrial production based on the hi-tech encouragement of entrepreneurship, ensuring the development of the non-oil sector and raising employment in the production sector. The park was authorized by the Ministry of Economy and Industry (formerly the Economic Development Ministry), while the coordinating organization is the SCIP. We are sure that the SCIP will play an important role in the development of Azerbaijan's industry and in raising its export potential. In general, the main objective of the organization is to stimulate the rapid development of Azerbaijan's economy and raise its international competitiveness among leading nations in the development of innovative industrial solutions.</p><h4>Has the general plan of the SCIP been approved?</h4><p>In line with this plan, prepared by a foreign consulting company, the SCIP will have an enormous surface area of 167.66 hectares. According to the same plan, the zone will cover an area of 114 hectares. This will combine areas intended for agriculture, medicine, and construction, as well as the production of chemical products for electronics and the automobile industry, and the production of polymers and industrial equipment. A social zone on an area of 21 hectares with full facilities will also be built for park residents. The park will have 16- and 20-story administrative buildings, an Exhibition and Conference Complex, a vocational school, a laboratory facility, a workshop, a daycare center, closed and open-air sports facilities, a health center, a campus, and other facilities to serve residents and employees. The vocational school will teach courses in chemistry, mechatronics, and construction. Its teaching methods will be designed in collaboration with Germany's Stuttgart Technical University, and will be based on the dual education principle, in line with European standards. To ensure the assimilation of the educational process and professional effectiveness, training will be conducted on the principle of education-practice-application. Thus, students will put into practice in a real production setting the knowledge acquired during their study. Essential seminars and training will be held to improve production process at the industrial park. The draft standard legislative acts and documents emanating from the regulations regarding industrial parks have now been approved. The General Plan of the SCIP has already been adopted and each of the important issues have been settled for construction works, and a residents' registration system created. The inauguration of the park was attended by the President of Azerbaijan on October 3, 2013, and the ceremony marked an important event in the history of the SCIP.</p><h4>How is the challenge of providing sufficient infrastructure being met?</h4><p>All infrastructural connections will be laid through underground tunnels and galleries. Gas distribution lines will be laid in two directions at the SCIP to ensure a high level of infrastructure service for its residents. Also, a plan is in place to build two modern electricity substations of 35 kW and 110 kW, respectively. Each substation will be provided with separate control and security centers. Furthermore, a large water system will be built in the SCIP featuring seven underground reservoirs to meet various needs. The road system will cover the park in its entirety. At the same time, a railroad will be laid through the park, with a loading and unloading zone set at the junction of the railway link.</p><div class="quote">“  In general, the main objective of the organization is to stimulate the rapid development of Azerbaijan's economy. "</div><h4>The Baku-Tbilisi-Kars rail project will be completed in 2015. What will be the significance of this project for the SCIP?</h4><p>Transportation issues have always held great importance worldwide in the development of industrial parks. The SCIP has a geographically favorable location in the vicinity of international seaports, and is for example, 361 kilometers from the Aktau seaport, 286 kilometers from the Turkmanbashi seaport, 838 kilometers from Trabzon seaport, 1,522 kilometers from Bandar-Abbas seaport, 364 kilometers from Astrakhan seaport, and 690 kilometers from Poti port. In addition, the commissioning of the Alat International Seaport will have the potential to receive 11.6 million tons of cargo. Meanwhile, the completion of the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway line capable of transporting 30 million tons of cargo a year will have a positive impact on the delivery of products from the SCIP to European and Asian markets. At the same time, there is a plan to establish cooperation with other complexes and with petrochemicals producer Petkim to ensure the SCIP's supply chain. The proximity of the SCIP to the Baku-Russia highway will facilitate import and export operations. Internal transportation lines will be built in all production and non-production areas of the industrial park.</p><h4>What is the level of investor interest in the SCIP, and what are your expectations regarding this trend in 2014?</h4><p>In general, Azerbaijan provides a number of benefits for foreign investors. These include political, economic and social stability, tolerance, a favorable geographical location, and proximity to the crude market, as well as the presence of a highly qualified workforce. These factors greatly reduce the risk of investment. A number of measures are being taken to attract investors to the SCIP, and presentations are frequently given. As a result, over 20 investment projects have been presented to the SCIP to date. Favorable investment conditions have clearly been created at the SCIP, where investors can expect generous incentives. In line with the legislation that has been in force since January 1, 2013, SCIP residents will be exempt from income, property, and land taxes, and from VAT on imported equipment for a period of seven years.</p><h4>Which events does the SCIP plan to attend in 2014?</h4><p>This year, the SCIP plans to take part in a number of key business events. These include Pipeline Coating 2014 in Vienna, PVC Formulation 2014 in Dusseldorf, Green Polymer Chemistry 2014 in Cologne, Specialty Packaging Films Asia 2014 in Bangkok, Stretch &amp; Shrink Film 2014 in Cologne, and the Caspian Oil &amp; Gas Exhibition 2014 in Baku. At the same time, the company regularly gathers information on new events in the global chemicals market and carries out organizational works to participate in important conferences, exhibitions, and forums. Along with its participation in domestic and foreign events, we will also take all the necessary steps to attract foreign investment. We believe that the SCIP will evolve into the chemical and industrial complex of the Middle East and raise the competitiveness of local production through the expansion of innovative and highly technological production and entrepreneurship in this area.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were some of Azercell's landmark developments of 2013?</h4><p>Overall, 2013 for Azercell may be characterized as one of improvement and innovation. Despite our full population coverage, we took other major steps toward network expansion by installing over 1,200 2G/3G/4G base stations. This was a record network rollout both in number of stations and timing. It accommodated the ever-growing demand for voice and data traffic, the latter having marked a tremendous growth of 120% in 2012. Another imperative for growing our network by over 20% was the approaching mobile number portability (MNP) project, which the company has been running as a 1.5-year cross-functional project. We have ensured that subscribers coming from our competitors enjoy a hassle-free experience, and that we have sufficient capacity to serve all of our customers at the highest quality standards. We have also boldly invested in our 4G LTE network, increasing the number of sites covering Baku and the Absheron peninsula. We pioneered the deployment of LTE in Azerbaijan, aware that it is the platform on which to develop next generation technologies and services. Our technologies also benefit society and the public service. In 2013, Azercell pioneered a system of authentication for mobile digital signatures, ASAN Imza (mobile signature). This enables subscribers to conduct electronic transactions at zero risk of fraud. Another innovation we launched that year was machine-to-machine (M2M) technology, enabling data measurement, collection, and transmission to relevant recipients. This technology is utilized by, among others, banking, transportation, security, the health sector, and utility services.</p><h4>Have average revenue per user (ARPU) rates been positively affected by the growing use of smartphone technology?</h4><p>As in Azerbaijan, data usage is rapidly rising worldwide, and hence mobile broadband leadership is one of Azercell's priorities. In mature markets, the tendency is for revenue growth to mostly derive from mobile internet; in our case, there is still a rising pattern for voice. However, a considerable portion of ARPU growth is already due to the tremendous growth of mobile internet usage. Customers are currently adopting data into their daily lives and, one day, I suspect this may fully replace voice communication needs. Globally, then, mobile internet's contribution to ARPU is growing, as that of voice declines over time. The telecommunications industry is re-inventing itself, and we are already on the cusp of this, stepping forward to data-centric communications, M2M, and the “Internet of Things."</p><h4>Azercell's parent company, TeliaSonera, operates in 20 markets globally. How does Azercell leverage this additional international experience?</h4><p>TeliaSonera has immense telecom experience spanning over 150 years; providing network access and telecommunication services that enable easy, efficient, and environmentally friendly communications. TeliaSonera invented and introduced mobile communication, and TeliaSonera experts also took an active part in developing the most widespread mobile communication standard of our times, GSM, in the 1980s. In December 2009, TeliaSonera became the first company in the world to commercially launch 4G services in Stockholm and Oslo. And in 2013, it was the first in the world to launch international 4G roaming. The know-how and expertise TeliaSonera has to offer us as a shareholder is clear. The international hands-on experience of TeliaSonera helps us increase mobile penetration, delivering our services in a cost-effective and sustainable manner, which leads to sustainable improved profitability and business growth.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The recent tragedy involving the Malaysia Airlines flight 370 has brought up the issue of air safety once again. As an aviation expert, how would you evaluate the safety of air transport of goods and passengers in Azerbaijani air space?</h4><p>As National Leader Heydar Aliyev used to say, “the most important task of aviation is to ensure safety." And we are trying to stick to this directive. Constant attention is being paid to improving the safety of flights in Azerbaijan. At present, all international airports of the Republic of Azerbaijan operate the most sophisticated navigation equipment, which is confirmed by relevant certificates issued by the International Civil Aviation Organizations. On October 2, 2013, President Ilham Aliyev attended the opening ceremony of the new building for the main air traffic control center of AzerAirNavigation. This organization manages flights in Azerbaijani airspace at all of the country's airports. It operates a system enabling the automated control of aircraft traffic along a certain route, during a flight and in landing, and provides for a high level of safety. The national flag carrier, Azerbaijan Airlines (AZAL), has been included on the IOSA register, an audit of International Air Transport Association (IATA) operators, and is a fully fledged member of the community of the world's safest airlines.</p><h4>You recently participated in the 19th ICAO Regional Aviation Safety Meeting in Baku. How do you view the importance of such international forums to enhance security in civil aviation?</h4><p>The active participation in all regional meetings, the introduction of new technologies, procedures, and recommended ICAO practices have enhanced the economic attractiveness of our country's airports for airlines around the world and contributed to a steady increase in traffic intensity and safety in Azerbaijan's airspace. To date, the trend toward an increase in air traffic shows Azerbaijan's importance from the standpoint of regional transport infrastructure development. In this regard, the fact that the 19th ICAO Regional Aviation Safety Meeting was held in Baku was particularly relevant. Regional civil aviation organizations periodically conduct international ICAO meetings here in Azerbaijan, which attests to the interest of the world aviation community in Azerbaijan's aviation potential and a recognition of a proper level of aviation safety in our country.</p><h4>During our last interview, you mentioned the accomplishments of the National Aviation Academy (NAA) of Azerbaijan. What important developments have taken place at the Academy over the last year?</h4><p>On the occasion of the 90th anniversary of the National Leader of Azerbaijan Heydar Aliyev and on the initiative of the rector of the NAA, Academic Arif Pashayev, a Museum of Heydar Aliyev was opened on May 6, 2013. In 2013, a new four-story building with 65 classrooms was officially put into operation. The first floor of the academic building is equipped with the necessary infrastructure for modern laboratories and specialized classrooms. In cooperation with AzerAirNavigation, an Automated Meteorological Observation Station (AWOS), fitted with modern equipment, has been installed on the territory of the NAA's Technopark. The construction of a two-story dormitory for 100 students has also been completed on the NAA campus. By order of the rector of the NAA dated October 1, 2013, the IATA Institute has been set up within the NAA. The IATA Institute has been accredited to provide training in four areas: transport of dangerous goods by air; aviation security; cabin crew training; and freight transportation. In 2014, the NAA plans to establish cooperation with the Educational Center of the European Joint Aviation Authorities, the Moscow Physical-Technical Institute, and the Technical University of Berlin.</p><h4>The Heydar Aliyev International Airport is benefitting from renovation and expansion projects, such as a new terminal complex and a new air traffic control center. What will this new capacity allow?</h4><p>I am confident that the new terminal will be one of the most beautiful and comfortable terminals for passengers in the world. Its appearance, design, and the infrastructure have been made at the highest level. The terminal will have the capacity for up to 6 million passengers annually, whereas, in comparison, the old passenger terminal could only process 3 million passengers a year. The total area of the complex is 65,000 sqm. The terminal has 30 escalators and 20 passenger elevators. The new facility is based on the latest scientific and technological achievements in the field of international aviation, including the so-called smart airport model. And, of course, the new airport terminal will be very comfortable for passengers—it has numerous recreation areas, high-speed internet access, cafés, restaurants, and other catering establishments from renowned brands. The high level of service and comfort will be particularly important in attracting transfer passenger traffic via the Heydar Aliyev International Airport and using the transit opportunities stemming from Azerbaijan's favorable geographic location. With regard to the air traffic control center, the commissioning of the equipment available in it will increase both the airport's capacity and transfer flows. The system controls the dispatching, radar, flight data, and flight plans online in conjunction with the relevant air traffic control centers of neighboring countries.</p><h4>What new international connections is AZAL expecting to establish in the coming year?</h4><p>At the end of May 2014, AZAL plans to open six new flight destinations from Heydar Aliyev International Airport, to Nizhny Novgorod, Minsk, Krasnoyarsk, Perm, Kazan, and Rostov. All these cities are home to a large number of ethnic Azerbaijanis, and regional diaspora leaders have repeatedly asked the national carrier of Azerbaijan to launch regular flights to their cities. However, in addition to direct traffic flow, we also expect to attract transfer passengers from these cities to AZAL's international route network. In addition to flights from Baku, we will also open international destinations from Ganja to Mineralnye Vody and Antalya. Ganja is a dynamically developing airport, and we intend to do everything to facilitate the growth of passenger traffic from there. There are also plans to launch a new domestic destination: Gabala-Nakhichevan. However, the most significant of the new routes will undoubtedly be the first intercontinental flight from Baku to New York. We plan to start regular flights to the US at the end of the summer season and have already received a permit from the US Federal Aviation Authority (FAA), the experts of which have praised the level of Azerbaijan's aviation safety compliance with international standards. This will be the first flight from our region to North America, and serves as further evidence of the status of AZAL as a regional leader in the field of passenger transportation.</p><h4>What will AZAL's main projects be in 2014-2015?</h4><p>This year will mark the start of operations at the new passenger terminal of Heydar Aliyev International Airport and the opening of the region's first regular flights to the US. However, this is not all. Today, Azerbaijan is known as a tolerant, sports-centric country and an attractive tourist destination, which regularly holds international exhibitions, festivals, and prestigious competitions. The European Gymnastics Championship will take place in 2014 and the inaugural European Games in 2015 to be held in Azerbaijan will signal the start of a new period in the European sports movement. We all know that during such activities civil aviation plays a huge role, and it is gratifying to note that the national flag carrier AZAL has been selected as the official carrier of the upcoming Games.</p>]]></richbody0content>

What projects is Azeryolservis working on to contribute to the development of the road infrastructure for this event?</h4><p>The fact that Azerbaijan will be hosting the inaugural European Games in 2015 is yet another major victory of our country. Of course, this victory is the logical result of the multifaceted policies pursued by the President of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, who has signed an order to set up an organizing committee to prepare for the first European Games in 2015. As a result of this decision, the President of the Heydar Aliyev Foundation, a member of the Executive Committee of the National Olympic Committee of Azerbaijan, and Goodwill Ambassador of UNESCO, Mehriban Aliyeva, has been appointed Chairperson of the committee. The activities currently underway are progressing on schedule and will create favorable conditions for a successful event. An action plan on resolving transportation problems in Baku has been prepared and is now being implemented. The plan involves the expansion and reconstruction of the roads leading to the Baku Olympic Stadium and other sports facilities, the construction of new road junctions and highway interchanges, and the expansion of the existing roads along with the construction of new routes to suburban recreation areas. In addition, road markings and the installation of road signs and the construction of major highways will be completed. One of the most important undertakings on our agenda is the construction of highway interchanges to the Baku Olympic Stadium, where the main events will be held. With this aim, work is ongoing to rebuild the Ziya Bunyadov Avenue and establish new road junctions over it. There are also plans to build a new road from the end of Hasan Aliyev Street, which runs parallel to Heydar Aliyev and Ziya Bunyadov avenues, to Keshla station over Ziya Bunyadov Avenue directly to the Olympic stadium. The road will be seven kilometers in length and have six lanes. Tunnels and interchanges will be built along the road as well. The mentioned roads are expected to be the most popular routes during the Games. In addition, reconstruction and expansion work will be carried out on other roads of the city.</p><h4>What are the main challenges in improving urban infrastructure in Azerbaijan, now that the main arteries have been built or renovated?</h4><p>The extensive landscaping work under way in the country certainly covers the city of Baku and its suburban settlements. The program of measures to improve the transport system in Baku and accelerate the overall socioeconomic development of suburban settlements of the city has contributed a great deal to the solution of road infrastructure problems in the capital. The construction and major overhaul carried out on the Zabrat-Balakhani-Mehdiabad-Khirdalan-Binagadi road, the Zikh roundabout-airport, the Azizbayov roundabout-airport and the Azadlig Square-Zikh roundabout highways, the Baku circular road 1, the stretch of the Baku-Alat highway between KP 2 and KP 6, the section of the road from the Sabunchu road junction to the Zabrat roundabout, the Zabrat-Mashtaga-Buzovna, the Zabrat-Pirshagi and the Zikh roundabout-airport-Gala highways, as well as other roads, avenues, and streets, have eliminated traffic congestion and created safer driving conditions. In addition, the Baku-Novkhani, Baku-Guba, Baku-Shamakhi, Buzovna-Mardakan-Gala, and the Gala-Shuvelyan-Pirallahi highways, as well as multi-tier road junctions on Ziya Bunyadov Avenue and Abdul Vahab Salamzadeh Street, are also contributing to the development of our infrastructure. According to resolutions signed by the head of state approving action plans on modernizing the transport system in Baku for 2006-2007 and 2008-2013, we have started the construction of highway interchanges and pedestrian crossings in a number of congested routes across the capital. As part of the program approved by the President for 2006-2013, a total of 61 modern road junctions and tunnels have been built and put into operation. We have completed 68 pedestrian crossings in Baku over this period. In addition to contributing to the safety of pedestrians in busy parts of the city, such crossings are also fitted with sophisticated equipment, which is an important novelty for our city.</p><h4>What experience have you gained in introducing new technologies to road construction?</h4><p>One of the most fundamental principles of the Ministry of Transport is to facilitate the sustainable development of the road infrastructure. In order to increase the adhesion qualities of bitumen, we have extensively utilized such additives as Sasobit, Creaton, Interlene in 400L, and Elvaloy AM. To minimize cracks in asphalt, we have recently introduced a mesh-shaped material called Geogrid, which contributes to a longer service life of the asphalt concrete coating and improves its quality. We have also begun cooperating with the American company US Road. This collaboration is intended to pave the way for the application of nano-tested polymeric products in Azerbaijan. We are determined to continue looking out for new road infrastructure technologies emerging across the globe.</p><div class="quote">“  We have received specific instructions on building roads even to the outermost mountain villages of the country. "</div><h4>What measures has Azeryolservis taken to facilitate the development of Azerbaijan's districts?</h4><p>In an effort to implement the instructions of the President in a timely and efficient manner, the Ministry of Transport has carried out major construction and renovation work on national and local roads. We can proudly say that specific measures have been taken to build comfortable roads connecting the various districts and residential settlements of the country with each other. The large-scale projects carried out in this direction have always been the focus of the President's attention. We have received specific instructions on building roads even to the outermost mountain villages of the country. The successful reconstruction of roads such as the Bilasuvar-Iranian border, Lankaran-Lerik, Masalli-Yardimli, Ganja-Dashkasan-Khoshbulag, Guba-Ispik-Khinalig, Shamakhi-Pirgulu, Tovuz-Alibayli, Shamkir-Gadabay, Ismayilli-Qabala, Khaldan-Mingachevir, Agdash-Laki, Guba-Gachrash-Gimilgazma, Gusar-Anig-Laza, Gazakhbayli-Ashagi Salahli, Qabala-Agdash, Oguz-Qabala, Guba-Gusar, Shaki-Gakh, Agstafa-Poylu, the Yevlakh-Barda stretch of the Yevlakh-Khojaly-Lachin road, and of more than 220 bridges, clearly demonstrates the level of attention to this sphere.</p><h4>What do you expect the new term of President Ilham Aliyev will bring to road infrastructure and the transport sector?</h4><p>The people of Azerbaijan passed another test by electing someone who has won widespread popular support. This demonstrates the people's desire to continue on the path toward rapid development and progress. As in all other spheres, the transport sector also achieved tremendous progress in 2013. Our company did its best to execute the tasks entrusted to it in 2013. All this shows yet again that the development of road infrastructure is one of the country's top priorities. This sphere holds a special place in the successful domestic policies of President Ilham Aliyev. The people working in this sector of the economy will continue to do their best to live up to public expectations for this sphere.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize AzVirtÊ¼s project delivery capacity and excellence in the field of road construction?<br></h4><p>Our main fields of activity are construction, reconstruction, and the repair of motorways, airports, bridges, and overpasses, as well as the production of road construction materials, and design works. AzVirt became one of the most reliable companies in the country thanks to the expertise acquired through the use of cutting-edge technology. We employ highly skilled personnel and well-trained road construction specialists. The construction of high-quality asphalt roads, the provision of strict laboratory control in the quality of road construction materials and products, the use of leading edge technologies and specialists from overseas, in addition to our own highly qualified experts underpin company development. Our employees, many of whom hold PhDs, are familiar with the theoretical and practical aspects of road construction. This academic connection also serves to stimulate innovative research. As a result of such research projects, a range of advanced techniques is applied in the production and construction of roads. AzVirt is the first and only company in Azerbaijan to use polymer and mastic asphalt in the construction of road pavement. For its important role in advancing transport infrastructure the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan awarded A.M. Aliyev, the Founder of AzVirt, the Shohrat Order for his merits in development of the national construction industry.</p><h4>The Bilgah-Sumgait road is one of the major projects you are currently working on. What has been the progress toward the completion of its second section?</h4><p>Works within the reconstruction of the Bilgah-Novkhany-Sumgait motorway have been divided into two phases. The initial phase of the project covers the first 14 kilometers and the second phase extends to 42 kilometers. Work on the first section was completed at the end of 2013. The construction of the tunnel by the Cardiological Center, a bridge, and an underground pedestrian passage has all been completed. The total length of the second section of the six-lane highway is 28 kilometers. This section will feature 10 bridges and overpasses. The main objective of the road is to provide an international link between settlements in the northeastern part of Absheron peninsula with the Baku-Guba highway by means of Mardakan-Bilgah-Novkhany-Sumgait highway bypassing Baku city. The new highway will also provide residents of these settlements access to the Baku-Shamakhi highway, which will contribute to a safer and more convenient link with western Azerbaijan. All construction is slated for completion by the end of 2015.</p><h4>AzVirt has an extensive portfolio of airport infrastructure work thanks to its contribution to the Gabala, Ganja, and Heydar Aliyev airports. How would you describe the company's expertise in this area, and what other projects are you looking to engage in?</h4><p>AzVirt has participated in the realization of numerous projects in the country as a general contractor. Our company has been making contributions to the development of air transportation, an economically crucial mode. Runways with a length of 3,300 meters at the Ganja and Lankaran Airports, 2,200 meters at the Zagatala Airport, 3,600 meters at the Qabala Airport, 2,400 meters at the Yevlakh Airport, and 4,000 meters at the Heydar Aliyev International Airport have been built and put into operation by AzVirt. Within the project, the construction of a new airport complex and control tower, as well as the reconstruction of existing air terminals at the Heydar Aliyev International Airport are ongoing. Work began in March 2011 on a 65,000 sqm area of the terminal to the highest standards. Once the new triangular four-story air terminal enters operation, it will begin to handle international flights, while the current terminal will be used solely for the domestic market. The latest scientific-technical innovations used in international aviation will be applied to the new complex increasing the annual capacity of the airport to 6 million passengers. Construction of the new airport in the city of Guba will also begin in 2014.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[A Fast Globalizing Company]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[a-fast-globalizing-company]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the company's performance in 2013?</h4><p>Overall, 2013 was a successful and important year for the country. Marking its 15th anniversary, Matanat A continued its development last year and managed to significantly expand its customer base both in and outside the country. The company has fully met its objectives regarding the development of human potential, globalization, and the application of state-of-the-art technologies. In 2013, Matanat A tried to maintain its course toward innovation, participated in numerous domestic and international exhibitions, and won several awards. We are hopeful that our products will continue to be of interest to our domestic and foreign customers in 2014, too.</p><h4>The nanotechnologies Matanat A showcased at the 2013 BakuBuild exhibition were some of the most memorable events of the show. What does Matanat A do to improve technology for the production of construction materials?</h4><p>The market is powered by competition. Over time, all service sectors undergo change and have to adapt to demand. In the 21st century, consumers give preference to cost-effective and quality products. To keep ahead of the market, we are always on the lookout for new technologies. We are always interested in bringing them to the country and applying them to our production. The application of nanotechnologies in the sphere of building materials in Azerbaijan was initiated by Matanat A. By pioneering the introduction of cutting-edge technologies we further increased the effectiveness of our production. Then we introduced SMART nanotechnology, which enables effective time management, saves energy resources, and makes the best use of the production capacity.</p><h4>Matanat A has received numerous awards from the Azerbaijan-Russia Business Cooperation Chamber for the quality of its products. How important is the Russian market for Matanat A?</h4><p>One of the goals of Matanat A is globalization. Our top priorities have always been expansion into foreign markets and the successful representation of the national economy abroad. Of course, it is also important if there is cooperation with these countries at a state level. We are primarily focused on the markets of Russia, Georgia, Iran, Turkey, Turkmenistan, and Kazakhstan. It is, therefore, no coincidence that we attach special importance to the MosBuild exhibition held in the capital of Russia every year. I would like to emphasize that MosBuild is not the only exhibition in Russia we are interested in attending. Of course, all this has been made possible thanks to the policy of economic cooperation pursued by President Ilham Aliyev. We, for our part, are trying to contribute to this cooperation.</p><div class="quote">“  The color green, which symbolizes nature and environmental protection, is also present in our logo. "</div><h4>How does Matanat A apply environmentally friendly standards to its production processes?</h4><p>The construction materials sector is fairly specific. Of course, no business or individual would want to cause harm to nature and the environment in which we all live. Unfortunately, industrial production inevitably involves environmental pollution. From the first day of our operations, we have adopted green business as our guiding principle. The color green, which symbolizes nature and environmental protection, is also present in our logo. We cooperate closely with both government agencies and NGOs by organizing various projects and campaigns in the area of environmental protection. The most important goal of these projects is to prevent environmental pollution. I think this is a very important issue. As you may be aware, 2010 was declared the “Year of Ecology" in Azerbaijan and it is very gratifying that as a result of several surveys commissioned in the country, Matanat A received the Friend of the Environment award. Our company applies international standards ISO 9001 and ISO 14001, among others. All our structural subdivisions are required to build their operations in accordance with applicable regulatory and legal documents.</p><h4>How would you describe the company's human resources strategy and its contribution to the creation of jobs and the training process?</h4><p>Human resources are the core of any business. In fact, the development of human potential is a national priority. Our company is also trying to expand its activities in this direction and is applying advanced management techniques. The production of quality goods and the implementation of a successful business strategy are underpinned by a number of factors. I believe that the first and foremost of these is a professional team and a healthy team spirit. A qualified and motivated team is the driving force of any business development. Realizing this, Matanat A has created favorable conditions for its staff to be able to realize their potential. The pleasant working conditions, team spirit, and availability of various training, educational, and career growth opportunities are always at the top of the company's agenda. In addition to specialized in-house training, our employees are also sent to international workshops and seminars to further improve their knowledge and skills, study modern management techniques, and stay abreast of innovations.</p><h4>Finally, what will be the key developments for Matanat A in 2014?</h4><p>As was the case in previous years, in 2014 our focus will also be on participation in the implementation of state programs and the overall development of the country. To do this, we need to become a sustainably developing business. We are prepared to purchase the technologies required for further development, train a qualified workforce, adopt sophisticated management techniques, and produce a broader assortment of goods. I am confident that our company will continue its course toward globalization in 2014 and become a model for other businesses to follow.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What projects has Ant Group completed in 2013, and what are you currently working on?</h4><p>Our projects in 2013 were a continuation of our regular work. We have registered a certain degree of progress in the construction industry in the private sector, and also with certain state projects. One of the planned projects involves the construction of a shopping center near the international bus station in Baku. And among our completed projects I would highlight the opening of our branch in Georgia, where we have commenced work on a highway project.</p><h4>In a previous interview, you said there was a lack of competent experts in Azerbaijan's construction sector. How does Ant Group contribute to solving this problem?</h4><p>The staff deficit is quite a normal phenomenon. And while there are numerous experts, demand exceeds supply. When undertaking projects involving a large volume of work, we often host experts from abroad to exchange experience, which is crucial for us. We do not have the facilities to provide on-the-job training in house, but employ young graduates and train them instead. Many companies avoid such practices, and we are proud of our track record. Indeed, many of those we train are today working at other larger companies.</p><h4>Ilham Aliyev was re-elected as President in 2013. What changes do you expect during this new term, particularly for the construction sector?</h4><p>The world is well aware of the pace of economic development in Azerbaijan, which is largely a result of the government's balanced policy. The driving force in the country is the continuous improvement in the welfare of the people, which is reflected in the high activity witnessed in the construction industry. Over the past decade, there have been noticeable changes in construction in Baku in particular, where living conditions have improved. For 2014 and beyond, the pace will only pick up, underpinned by numerous factors, the most important of which is the solid financial conditions of the population, which determines housing demand. Urban infrastructure is being implemented, new settlements are under construction, and new land is being primed for development.</p><h4>What are your plans for 2014?</h4><p>We are builders, so for us there is no real preference in terms of what to construct; we essentially pursue profitable projects. Being builders, however, we have not focused to the same extent on the commercial side of real estate sales. We have many plans, which include the development of housing complexes with a fresh offering. And as of 2014, we will start building furnished apartments boasting modern facilities to the exacting international standards that our clients expect. We plan to build 18- to 20-story residential blocks on an area of approximately 100,000 sqm of land. Two factors we have decided on are to provide housing featuring sufficient parking space, and apartments that are already furnished so that the client merely needs to move in. We also produce furniture that is offered to clients optionally. To my thinking, this approach is less innovative, but rather essential in today's market. While housing construction is our first priority, we also participate in tenders for state projects, having secured a large volume of multi-dimensional work. For 2014, we plan to participate in many more tenders.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the extent of the company's aluminum, alunite, and ferrous mining and processing activities, and its position in the mining sector?<br></h4><p>Det.Al is a leading group of companies in the Azerbaijani non-ferrous industry that produces aluminum oxide (alumina), primary aluminum, and semi-final aluminum products of bauxite and alunite ore. In light of our activities, we are pleased that 2014 was proclaimed the Year of Industry. This initiative is part of a wider industrialization policy carried out on a large scale in Azerbaijan, through which hundreds of industrial enterprises have been built and a strong potential created in this area starting from the 1970s and 1980s. As in other sectors of the economy, great success has been achieved in the development of industry and the volume of industrial production has increased by a factor of 2.7 the last decade alone. Modern competitive industrial fields have been established, numerous projects have been implemented to improve industrial infrastructure, new workplaces have been created, and the country's industry has entered a new stage of development.</p><h4>You have just announced the production of semi-fabricated materials at a new smelter. How do you expect the production, sale, and export of these products to develop over the coming years?</h4><p>In 2012, when President Ilham Aliyev inaugurated the first phase of Det.Al's aluminum complex, he noted that “a new period has begun in the Azerbaijan metallurgical industry." There is no doubt that the President's sagacious internal and external politics have helped with the development of the non-oil sector, the expansion of investment programs, the protection of macroeconomic stability, and the implementation of industrial capacity building programs, which have all had a positive impact on the activities and development of Det.Al. This approach to economic growth is guided by the “from a strong economy to strong state" principle. The inauguration of Det.Al's aluminum complex in January 2012, the annual capacity of which is 50,000 tons, and the inauguration of the Det.Al aluminum semi-final production plant in January 2014 exemplifies the success of this growth strategy. Det.Al's metal casting and continuous rolling plant and the rolling and coating plant both have an annual capacity of 50,000 tons and meet international standards. The main contractor that built the two new plants was China Non-Ferrous Metals Processing Technology (CNPT). The contractor has been responsible for building large-scale aluminum plants in China belonging to Chinalco and Chalco, and has a formidable reputation and over 45 years of experience in the non-ferrous metal processing field. In addition to Chinalco, the company's clients also include Canada's Alcan, Alcoa of the US, and Switzerland's Hydro. During the production and installation of equipment in order to meet our demands, the producer assumed European standards as a basis to ensure product quality. The most important components originate from the US, Italy, Germany, and Japan. The liquid aluminum extracted from the electrolysis baths is transported to the metal casting and continuous rolling plant for the annual production of 50,000 tons of aluminum continuous casting coils with a thickness of 6 mm to 8 mm. These coils serve as raw materials for the production of flat rolled products. Two new fields were established in the newly opened rolling and coating plant, namely the cold rolling area, with 50,000 tons in annual production capacity, and the coating area, with 17,000 tons of annual production capacity.</p><h4>What does Det.Al's collaboration with international institutions consist of?</h4><p>In order to export manufactured products, contracts have already been signed with Turkish, Italian, Polish, Egyptian, Russian, and Ukrainian companies. The companies involved are satisfied with the quality of our products. We are currently working on producing final goods from aluminum semi-finished products. Efforts are underway to build new plants for the production of foil for technical and food products, different types of sandwich panels, wire, and other final goods. Det.Al's newly opened aluminum semi-final production plants will contribute to the development of the non-oil sector, and the strengthening of the industrial potential of the regions and the non-ferrous metallurgical industry.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been the 2013 Year of ICT's legacy in terms of improving interconnectivity and advancing the use of technology in the country?<br></h4><p>The year opened up new opportunities for the future development of the ICT field in Azerbaijan, and was a fertile period that saw a number of prestigious events. In declaring 2013 as the Year of ICT, Ilham Aliyev, the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan, once again, emphasized the ICT sector as a priority for ensuring the reliable socio-economic development of the country. On February 8, 2013, Azerbaijan launched its first telecommunications satellite, Azerspace-1, into orbit. This marked one of Azerbaijan's greatest achievements since its independence. Azerspace-1 enables us to provide telecommunications, internet, television, and radio broadcasting services to Europe, the Middle East, Central Asia, and Africa. Today, all state TV channels of Azerbaijan and a number of private channels are broadcast via Azerspace-1. The transition to digital broadcasting has almost been completed, and currently, 96% of the population can access digital TV broadcasting. Enormous steps have been taken to enable citizens to benefit from the opportunities created by the application of state-of-the-art technologies. Consequently, 70% of the population uses the internet, half of which are broadband internet users. Meanwhile, there are 110 mobile subscriptions for every 100 people. The application of 3G and 4G technologies is also being extended. Preparatory works for the implementation of a project to install a fiber-optic network, making the provision of high-speed broadband internet services through the Fiber to the Home (FTTH) project possible, have been completed and the project will be implemented this year. With its successful implementation, internet access at speeds of 10-100 MB per second will be provided nationwide, including rural areas. Last year will also be remembered for the foundation of the Azerbaijan Information Technologies University. Approximately 60 students with high admission grades already study at this university. The competence and experience gained at this institution will enable young people to meet the demands of the information society as well-qualified specialists. There have also been some great achievements on the e-government front. The usage of e-signature and e-payments has been largely extended and the quality and coverage area of e-services provided to citizens by state bodies on a one-stop-shop principle has been increased. With a view to continuing legal and other expedient measures in this field, state programs on the extension of e-services in state bodies in 2014-2016 and the development of e-government have been drafted and are planned for adoption in 2014. Considerable steps have also been taken regarding the provision of national information security. The State Agency for Special Communications and Information Security, and the Electronic Security Center, have commenced activity with the purpose of improving works being carried out in this field, protecting the information resources and systems of state bodies from possible threats, and raising nationwide preparedness and awareness on cyber security. Outstanding works have been carried out in the field of ICT in 2013, thus making Azerbaijan's Year of ICT a success.</p><h4>Could you elaborate on the significance of Azerspace-1?</h4><p>Azerbaijan has attached great importance to the idea of the establishment and development of a national space industry in recent years. Our country has succeeded in realizing its plans by launching its first-ever telecommunications satellite, Azerspace-1, into orbit. That was one of the most remarkable events on the 2013 calendar. During the realization of this project, Azerbaijan managed to establish and effectively maintain fruitful relations with leading states in the global space industry. The launch of Azerspace-1 has laid solid groundwork for the formation of a national aerospace sector within the structure of the local economy. Currently, Azerbaijan is successfully commercializing its satellite resources in international markets. To speak picturesquely, our country is in the process of extending its economy into space. All of these achievements have been made possible as a result of the strategic economic policy pursued by Ilham Aliyev, the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan, who, in 2010, decreed the establishment of the Azercosmos Open Joint Stock Company, the national satellite operator, consequently providing modern infrastructure for upcoming satellite projects. Thus, today, Azercosmos is efficiently managing the operation of Azerspace-1 from its own premises. The satellite projects of Azerbaijan have been primarily designated for its own needs and expectations. In this respect, and considering the novelty of this sector in the country, we envision a growing demand from local government and private institutions for satellite-related services over the coming years. We see great potential to strengthen the position of Azerbaijan in the satellite industry, and have plans in place for future projects in terms of a low-Earth orbiting remote sensing satellite and a second telecommunications satellite. The new satellites, which are scheduled for launch in 2016 and 2017, respectively, will fortify the image of Azerbaijan as a reliable partner in the satellite business community around the world. While the second telecommunications satellite, preliminarily intended to function in the Ka-band, will open up new business opportunities and will serve as a back up point for the first one, the low-Earth remote sensing satellite will grant Azerbaijan entry into the international space imaging market.</p><h4>Azerbaijan manages the Trans-Eurasian Information Super Highway (TASIM). What is the importance of this project and similar initiatives aimed at improving regional connectivity?</h4><p>In the Eurasia region, there is a problem of isolation from the two major internet backbones, which stretch from Japan to New Zealand and North America to Europe. In that respect, Azerbaijan is uniquely located, in terms of ICT, between developing and developed countries. Backed by two special UN General Assembly resolutions, the TASIM project was created in order to approach the level of developed countries. The TASIM project will connect Hong Kong with Frankfurt, and will thus provide high-speed internet to the large Eurasian region. On December 3, 2013, the participants of the project signed an Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in Baku. The document aims at outlining the further implementation of the project and determining the participants' roles and responsibilities, financial expenditures, and legal status. However, the establishment of information highways is not the only important task. Their appliance to advanced development such as the introduction of e-education and e-health carry as much, if not more, importance. Therefore, we need cooperation between countries and between different sectors such as governments, businesses, and society.</p><div class="quote">“  Today, all state TV channels of Azerbaijan and a number of private channels are broadcast via Azerspace-1. "</div><h4>The construction sector is growing at unprecedented rates. To what extent is the Ministry of Communications and High Technologies working to promote smart buildings?</h4><p>Currently, this field is rapidly developing worldwide. More than ever, the application of LTE technology and M2M devices has opened up great opportunities. Whereas today the income related to M2M devices constitutes $200 billion globally, that figure is expected to have reached $1.2 trillion by 2022. And while the expenditure on smart building projects was at $5.5 billion in 2012, it is set to reach $18.1 billion in 2014. Evidently, this field will become more developed over the next 10 years. Today, the state-of-the-art telecommunications infrastructure installed in our country and the application of LTE and FTTH technologies offer ample opportunities for rendering new value-added broadband services, smart buildings, and even the construction of smart settlements. A number of companies are already offering their own services. For example, a mobile telecommunications company has recently introduced its smart home project on the basis of an M2M platform at the BakuTel 2013 exhibition. Through this project, while away from home it will be possible to control power, gas, and water supply, and home owners will be able to open the door for guests, turn off electric devices remotely, operate the security system, turn on the air-conditioner in hot weather before returning home, and carry out a variety of other tasks. It is even possible to control the smart home by mobile phone from any location in the world. Today, a large smart home project is being carried out in Baku. Located in the center of Baku bay, a preeminent, modern, and large-scale residence will be constructed over an area of 221 hectares.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe 2013 for Embawood in terms of its international expansion and increased share of the domestic market?</h4><p>In general, I would evaluate 2013 as a successful year for our company. From the point of view of expanding our retail sales, we have been able to broaden our network both in Azerbaijan and in other countries in which we operate. The new furniture models we have designed have gone down well with customers and earned a place in our sales. We have also carried out a number of important projects aimed at improving the quality of our service. These factors have contributed to strengthening the company's domestic market share.</p><h4>Which brands do you intend to promote in 2014?</h4><p>In foreign markets, we operate as a single brand, as we are attempting to develop the Embawood brand in different countries. We do not have plans for the introduction of a second home furniture model to foreign markets. In Azerbaijan, however, we have four brands. Two of these, Embawood and Madeyra, cater to home furniture. Ideal Design specializes in the production of office furniture and EmbaPanel in prefabrication and accessories. Since each brand addresses a specific market segment, they do not correlate with each other. This having been said, we consider increasing our attention on the production of office furniture in Azerbaijan and plan to take a more active position in this segment in 2014.</p><h4>How does Embawood ensure that its production process complies with environmental and safety standards?</h4><p>Firstly, we pay attention to the environmental friendliness of the raw materials we procure. All the suppliers we work with are required to provide documentation confirming compliance with environmental standards and certification in accordance with European requirements. Following an initial examination, all incoming materials also undergo laboratory trials. These involve both environmental compliance of the material and its conformity with international requirements pertaining to quality. These projects include joint undertakings with German quality assurance companies, and as a result, these procedures are rigorously applied at all stages of production, thus eliminating any deficiencies. Therefore, we are applying European quality standards to our operations both in Azerbaijan and elsewhere.</p><h4>President Ilham Aliyev was elected for a third term of office. What impact do you think his election will have on the industry and the manufacturing sector?</h4><p>The re-election of our President is an important factor in maintaining the stable development of both our country and the region as a whole. The large-scale economic projects implemented under the leadership of Ilham Aliyev and the reforms in the area of private enterprise development have been helpful for the manufacturing sector. A major impetus has been given to industrial development of the country. The social projects aimed at improving the wellbeing of our citizens have raised the standard of living, which, in turn, has paved the way for an increased purchasing power of the population and created an atmosphere of sound competition. I am sure that the work carried out in this area, along with coming socioeconomic reforms, will take Azerbaijan forward.</p><h4>What are Embawood's objectives in 2014, and what new projects does the company intend to pursue?</h4><p>We have rather ambitious plans for 2014. We plan on implementing a number of new projects, including one that involves increased production. We plan to invest heavily in the production of upholstered furniture, all of which will take place within the country. In 2013, we carried out the necessary preparations and procurement for this project, and in 2014, we will also take steps to upgrade and expand capacity at our production sites. The procurement of raw materials from abroad will also be minimized.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[on-the-production-line]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate the activity of the Ganja Automobile Plant in 2013?</h4><p>In comparison with previous years, our company has further expanded its operations and introduced substantial changes, both in terms of the quality of machinery we manufacture and modifications. For example, while in 2012 our enterprise produced 599 tractors of various models, in 2013 the figure rose to 729. We manufactured 230 special-purpose MAZ trucks last year, which is 68 vehicles more than in 2012. In 2012, we produced 504 units of overhead equipment of different models, but in 2013 the figure climbed by 202 to reach 706 units. According to trilateral agreements signed in 2013, we commissioned a Haller public works truck and 22 tractor-trailers.</p><h4>During our last interview, you mentioned you were in negotiations with Amkodor of Belarus to commence the assembly of its products in Azerbaijan, as well as with MAZ for city and intercity buses. How did these negotiations progress?</h4><p>The Ganja Automobile Plant and Amkodor Holding signed a memorandum in the summer of 2012. According to the document, joint projects involving the production of road construction, public utility, snow-removal, aerodrome, forest, agricultural, and other specialized machinery and equipment in Azerbaijan will be implemented. Market research is currently underway both in and beyond Azerbaijan in preparation for large-scale production. The issue of the assembly of MAZ buses at our plant is also high on the agenda. In fact, it was the subject of negotiations during a recent official visit of Belarusian Prime Minister Mikhail Myasnikovich to Ganja. The experimental assembly of two buses has been completed at the Ganja Automobile Plant. MAZ intercity buses differ from similar vehicles in a number of aspects. In addition to being soft furnished and comfortable, they are also multi-functional and intended for all categories of the population. The buses are also fully adapted for disabled passengers traveling in wheelchairs, who can board directly from the pavement and have specific seats and handrails inside. Also, the buses are particularly well suited for children and the elderly. I hope that we commence assembly of MAZ buses in Azerbaijan in the near future.</p><h4>What other new models did the Ganja Automobile Plant introduce and what new partnerships did it forge?</h4><p>Ever since 2004, Ganja Automobile Plant has been introducing novel products. Our enterprise currently assembles 10 modifications of tractors, several models of MAZ vehicles, tractor-trailers, DEM excavators, MUP public works vehicles, asphalt spreaders, snow ploughs, and other vehicles. We have been assembling 16- and 22-cubic-meter trucks for the transportation of domestic waste for the past two years. In 2013, we also assembled different-purpose vehicles on the basis of the MAZ chassis. Work in this direction will be continued in 2014, as we plan to start the assembly of new automobile models. In addition to what we have produced in previous years, we intend to start assembling heavy-duty MAZ trailers and MAZ-based trucks with special X-ray cabins. We will assemble high-capacity silage transporters and tractor-trailers for the transportation of cannery wastes. As part of our cooperation agreement with Germany and Belarus, which envisages the manufacture of trucks for the transportation of domestic waste, we also plan to begin the assembly of machinery for municipal landscaping. In January 2014, the Ganja Automobile Plant and Germany's Kirchhoff Group signed a new cooperation agreement, which will enable us to export the machinery assembled in Azerbaijan to third countries. This is expected to significantly increase production by up to 60% to 70%.</p><h4>The plant provides equipment for various sectors of the economy, including agriculture and transport. Which of these generates the highest demand for your products?</h4><p>It is possible to say that there is demand for all machinery in Azerbaijan. The tractors and suspended equipment manufactured by our enterprise are extensively used by farmers and business people. The special-purpose MAZ vehicles we produce are assembled on the basis of a state order, while tractors and suspended equipment are marketed through leading state-company Agro-leasing.</p><h4>President Aliyev declared 2014 as the Year of Industry in Azerbaijan. How is the Ganja Automobile Plant contributing to the government's agenda of industrial development?</h4><p>During a Cabinet meeting dedicated to the results of the socioeconomic development in 2013, the head of state touched upon objectives for 2014 and declared it the Year of Industry. In order to continue the successes achieved in previous years, the President emphasized the importance of expanding the public investment program, protecting macroeconomic stability, continuing economic reforms as well as state support for private enterprise, and maintaining low inflation. Identifying as a primary objective the need for food product demand to be met by domestic resources, the head of state issued instructions regarding the expansion of land reclamation and irrigation activities, the establishment of large farms, the allocation of additional financial resources for the acquisition of new machinery, and the finalization of a comprehensive land database. Of course, as an industrial enterprise, the Ganja Automobile Plant will work to contribute to the execution of these instructions. Taking into consideration the fact that the President has stressed the priority nature of agricultural development, and the fact that our enterprise mainly manufactures machinery of an agricultural profile, we can safely say that our plant has to reserve a special place for national agricultural development. Our plant manufactures special-purpose MAZ automobiles, as well as different tractor and suspended equipment models. In 2014 alone, we intend to produce 900 tractors, 600 suspended equipment units, 30 tractor trailers, high-capacity tractor-based silage transporters, and tractor-trailers for the transportation of cannery wastes.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What progress has Inter Glass made in 2013 in increasing production volumes and introducing new technologies?</h4><p>As I predicted in my interview last year, 2013 was a good year for our firm. This is evidenced by the increase in the range of products and the expansion of the customer base. Proceeding from the growth in the number of customers and the demand for colored (green) glass, we have launched a project on the installation of a second line (second furnace) at the plant in cooperation with renowned foreign companies. The project is scheduled for completion in the near future. The commissioning of the second line will allow us the opportunity to double our output from 100,000 to 120,000 products at the moment to 200,000 to 240,000 and significantly increase our workforce.</p><h4>How has the demand for Inter Glass products evolved in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>The significant increase in the number of our customers is the result of prudent policies pursued by the company. The high quality of goods we manufacture together with both local and foreign specialists has paved the way for a number of companies to establish partnerships with us. The cutting-edge equipment and state-of-the-art technologies we use in production enable the production of light products. Our top priority is to provide our customers with quality products. Inter Glass currently produces up to 100 types of glassware, and the number of new orders is always on the increase.</p><h4>The administration declared 2014 as the Year of Industry. What contribution can Inter Glass make to this initiative?</h4><p>The fact that this year has been declared the Year of Industry by the country's leadership is an indicator of prudent policies and reforms. The conditions created for the manufacturing sector and the numerous industrial forums held in the country have triggered rapid development in the industrial sector. Taking advantage of this situation, our company has initiated the implementation of a new project. We have started to import quartz sand, which is considered one of the key components in the production of glass. This has significantly reduced the cost of production and facilitated the timely delivery of raw materials required for production. I would also like to bring to your attention that the sand available in the fields in Azerbaijan is not fully suitable for glass production. However, we have purchased equipment from a German company to enrich this sand, which will soon enable us to use the local raw material in production.</p><h4>How can industrial development contribute to the growth of regional economy in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>The commissioning of a number of modern industrial enterprises in the regions in recent years is gratifying. First of all, it means additional jobs for the people and a reduction of the country's dependence on the oil sector. It is also worth mentioning that at a time when the whole world is exposed to a severe economic recession, Azerbaijan is registering growth in all sectors of the economy, which is evidence of the judicious policies of President Ilham Aliyev.</p><h4>In the presidential election last October, President Ilham Aliyev won a sweeping victory to become president for a third term. What does his re-election mean for industrial development?</h4><p>The election of President Ilham Aliyev for a third term in office is a victory for all Azerbaijani people. As a result of the sensible policies pursued by the President, the wellbeing of our people has significantly improved and Azerbaijan has become an economically powerful state enjoying international respect. Since industry is considered an important component of the national economy, its development will make an even greater contribution to the country's development. Industry represents a large segment of the economy. It covers the military, defense, mechanical engineering, light and heavy industries, construction, plants and factories, and more. The development of all these sectors is of tremendous importance to the national economy. I am sure that this development and growth will be further reinforced to make Azerbaijan an even stronger state from the economic point of view.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you provide us with an overview of Azinterpartlayis-X LLC' activities?<br></h4><p>During the Soviet period, the mining industry in Azerbaijan was not significantly developed compared to other sectors of the economy. I graduated from the Moscow State Mining University, and have been working as a mining professional since then. The use of explosives is one of the most complex processes in mining, and Azinterpartlayis-X LLC has achieved great success in this area of business. Since 2010, we have cooperated with Australian company Orica. We also collaborate with Azerbaijan International Mineral Resources Operating Company (AIMROC), the Azerbaijan International Mining Company (AIMC), and Dashkesan Iron Ore Company. Apart from major oil and gas deposits, there are numerous mining sites for ferrous and nonferrous metals, and construction materials including gypsum, limestone, and trim stone. The deposits of gold and other precious metals add up to a diverse geological matrix. There are over 800 mines with confirmed deposits, some located in the territories occupied by Armenian military forces. Although oil and gas have dominated the economy since the Soviet era, the mining industry remains a lucrative trade. However, the Azerbaijani mining industry has yet to overcome a shortage of skilled professionals, especially technicians.</p><h4>What type of deposits are you mainly working with?</h4><p>Azinterpartlayis-X LLC operates in the exploration of gold, copper, iron, and limestone reserves. We are also working on other large-scale projects, such as a tunnel system for a water reservoir, road construction, and the demolition of old and uninhabitable buildings. Geological exploration is a relatively new activity for us. Most ongoing exploration takes place at nonferrous mines to determine deposit levels. Lately, we have been working with a new fiber cement plant to explore silica sand reserves. Furthermore, there are several large construction materials plants in Azerbaijan the demand for which determines sector development in the mining industry.</p><h4>How does the company ensure safety standards at its operations?</h4><p>We are an ISO-certified company, which underlines the importance we give to this issue, and we were in fact the first Azerbaijani company to obtain such certification in the mining industry. Furthermore, our personnel is certified by the Azerbaijani authorities in compliance with local regulations and by our partner company, Orica. International certification is an essential component of global recognition. Moreover, in the field our application of leading-edge technologies ensures high environmental and workplace safety levels.</p><h4>Since gold mining is a key activity for Azerbaijan, how has this impacted the local mining sector?</h4><p>Currently, gold mining does not actually have a major impact on the Azerbaijani economy. And since Azinterpartlayis-X LLC works as a contractor in gold mines, global gold price fluctuations have not influenced our operations. I am trying to keep updated with the latest global trends in the mining industry. There are clear signs that the government is seeking to develop the country's industrial base in general, and President Ilham Aliyev has in fact declared 2014 the Year of Industry in Azerbaijan, with mining squarely on the agenda for industrial development.</p><h4>How do you foresee the next two to three years for the Azerbaijani mining industry, and your company in particular?</h4><p>The Azerbaijani mining sector is undergoing its development stage. Azerbaijan has great economic potential in the form of fertile agricultural plots and relatively developed non-oil related industries. The rapid development of the Azerbaijani mining industry in 2014 will be witnessed not only by mining experts, but also by the general population across the country. As for our company, we aim to expand our exploration activities over the coming years to include both ferrous and nonferrous deposits. And looking ahead, Azinterpartlayis-X LLC will continue to contribute to growth of the broader Azerbaijani economy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What did 2013 mean for Azercosmos and Azerbaijan's space program in general?<br></h4><p>As the government of Azerbaijan attaches great importance to the development of ICT, this sector of the economy has gained considerable influence in socio-economic life in recent years. Therefore, it is not surprising that President Ilham Aliyev declared 2013 as the “Year of ICT." In 2013, we were able to launch Azerbaijan's first ever satellite, which constitutes an important accomplishment not only for Azercosmos, but also for the country as a whole. This was one of the strategic projects carried out by the government as part of a wider plan of economic diversification and development of the non-oil economy. Azerspace-1 undoubtedly represents an investment in our future and it will be a source of pride for the whole nation for many years to come.</p><h4>What was the cost of the Azerspace-1 project?</h4><p>The total cost of the project, along with insurance, was around $230 million. However, 85% of this project was financed by foreign banks, such as Ex-Im Bank of the US and France's Coface. The fact that these banks were willing to fund the project proves that it appeared promising and profitable from the very outset. The government only funded 15% of the cost. It is noteworthy that Azercosmos was able to secure a highly competitive premium insurance rate for the launch plus one-year cover. This was the lowest rate observed in the satellite insurance market since 1999. Azercosmos was able to obtain a highly competitive premium rate, despite being the first satellite operator of its kind in Azerbaijan and the entire Caucasus region, due to a number of factors. Firstly, its close partnership with highly credible companies in manufacturing and the launching of its satellite inspired the confidence of insurers in the hardware being used. Secondly, various relationship-building measures were implemented with key satellite insurers and senior members of the Azercosmos management, allowing the insurers to better understand the business of Azercosmos, thus increasing their desire to support the program. Finally, with the assistance of its international partners in its short lifetime since its incorporation in 2010, Azercosmos was able to overcome a number of technical, commercial, and managerial challenges that ensured robust insurance cover provided by a small group of the most financially sound and secure insurance capacity providers in the world.</p><h4>How have the financial returns been since the launch of the satellite?</h4><p>The international satellite services market is highly competitive due to the large number of well-established global and regional players; however, we are not afraid of competition as we have a well-developed business strategy, and we know where we want to be at least 10 years from now. Once you develop the right techniques, models, and strategies, there is a major chance that you will be successful. As we were developing our business model, instead of spending our valuable time on market research we decided to talk to our perspective customers, gauge their feedback, and ultimately reshape our ideas and products to fit what they actually wanted. And today, we can certainly describe the launch of Azerspace-1 as a great commercial success for us. In the first six months after the launch, we were able to generate $10 million in revenues, which is astonishing—even for established satellite operators.</p><h4>What markets can the satellite service target?</h4><p>Azerspace-1 has a hybrid payload including both C-band and Ku-band antennas. With the Ku-band antenna, we cover the markets in Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East, the European part of Russia, and, of course, the Caucasus. With the C-band, which has 24 transponders, we cover one of the most promising markets in the world, Africa. One thing I would like to point out is that the C-band transponders are switchable; therefore, we can easily divert the focus of attention to fully cover, for example, Europe or Central Asia. Our main goal with the satellite has always been to cover an extensive market that has a bilingual heritage, such as Central Asia, and offer them much required TV services. We offer both Russian and Turkish language TV channels there. When it comes to the Middle East market, we try to accommodate their needs in terms of both Arabic and English content. We plan to take important steps over the next two to three years, especially in Africa, where we are working to build up our customer base.</p><h4>What strategies are being employed to develop Azerbaijan's space program in the future?</h4><p>For the years to come, Azercosmos has two projects to foster Azerbaijan's space program. The first is to launch the Azerspace-2 in near future. We have recently been awarded an important grant by the US Trade and Development Agency, and are attracting world-class consultancy services for feasibility studies on Azerspace-2. We plan to launch the second telecommunications satellite by the end of 2017. Secondly, Azercosmos supports national development goals by implementing a strong national geo-information system infrastructure designed to meet the needs of the country, and the region. Azercosmos is implementing a plan to acquire an Earth observation and remote-sensing satellite system. The satellite-based Earth observation system will be an enabler to achieve many core objectives, such as the production of imagery data useful for the national GIS infrastructure, the support of agricultural activities, environmental monitoring, ecological and natural resources research, and support for disaster and emergency management activities.</p><h4>How would you assess Azerbaijan's developments in the space industry compared to its regional counterparts?</h4><p>Compared to other countries in this region, Azerbaijan's space project was not dictated by a national imperative or political aspiration. Our priorities are commercially driven and are an example of how we can assure the sustainability of our national economy for the future and identify potential investment areas to meet the real potential of our country. On the other hand, with a population of over 9 million and a terrain of mountains and plateaus, Azerbaijan has its own specific challenges in bringing connectivity to its people, especially to those residing in remote and hard-to-reach mountainous areas. Satellite networks can be rolled out quickly and inexpensively to hundreds or thousands of locations, where the cost of fiber is prohibitive. It will also eliminate the dependence of the country on other satellite networks and will provide the population with high-quality TV and radio broadcasting.</p><h4>What are the main activities planned for Azercosmos in 2014?</h4><p>In the first half of the year, we announced a tender and hopefully will sign a contract for the manufacture of a remote sensing satellite.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Back of the Net]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[back-of-the-net]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you talk about your own brand smartphone? What informed the decision to launch this product?</h4><p>Ours is an Android smartphone of high quality that features a 4.3-inch screen. Our strategy was to move from piling data via dongles onto our network to getting people to use their handsets to access and use the internet. The increasing sales of this terminal proved to be a key element of our 2013 strategy. The Bakcell smartphone was a means of achieving this quickly, and also of leveraging the trust invested in the Bakcell brand, especially in the area of mobile data and internet connectivity. The Sür@ (Bakcell 3G service) brand and the Bakcell brand are well known for providing the best mobile data and mobile internet services. Therefore, combining these with a handset of good quality and high functionality was an obvious step for us. Approximately 45% of the market uses Sür@. The key consideration with smartphones is to get people to use the internet on the go. We have seen a significant rise in the tablet segment in 2013 and are pushing smartphones and bigger screens in 2014, as well as devices that are somewhere between tablets and smartphones. What we see are more people using their phones to access the internet on a more ongoing basis. Dongles tend to be heavily oriented toward YouTube and Skype and similar programs. With handsets the array of uses is much broader.</p><h4>What is Bakcell's interest in mobile applications?</h4><p>We don't own an app store, as there are a number of challenges surrounding them in Azerbaijan. For many, you have to first register a credit card, the national penetration of which is low. Thus, purchasing an application can be a challenging activity for many customers. Moreover, many applications are in the English language, not even in Russian, and certainly not Azerbaijani. That being said, our partner, Manchester United, has launched an app globally in five languages, one of which was Azerbaijani. That was an important indication of how important our relationship with the club is to them. Generally, many customers are still at the experimental stage. They are downloading free apps rather than paid-for ones. The challenge, then, is to encourage customers to move to paid apps.</p><h4>To what extent have you grown your 3G and 4G networks?</h4><p>We have increased our traffic by more than 100%, and our revenues have grown substantially as a result. I think the number of regular users has increased dramatically and it is that regular usage that counts in terms of changing the nature of how people use their devices. We still believe there is a long way to go in 3G, especially beyond the peninsula. We offer good coverage and its improvement will allow us to access even more customers. We are looking at technology to widen our coverage dramatically compared to the competition. The motive behind the launch of an LTE network is the availability of LTE-enabled devices. For example, Apple does not yet enable iPhones for LTE in Azerbaijan, despite the fact that they are compatible. We will build the LTE system, but it is a focus for somewhere further down the line. First of all we need to monetize our 3G segment.</p><h4>What do you expect to be the main events for Bakcell in 2014?</h4><p>I expect mobile number portability (MNP) to gain momentum throughout the year. It has been long awaited and I think foresee a period of momentum building. In other major developments we are seeing fixed-line broadband providers begin to move back into the market. They created a market opportunity for the mobile providers with their limited offering at the time, whereby we observed stronger growth in fixed line in the latter part of 2013. I, in fact, expect to see a stronger fixed-line performance in 2014, which will motivate us to present greater mobility proposition to our customers.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is Nar Mobile poised to benefit competitively from mobile number portability (MNP), which has just taken effect?</h4><p>Our advantage lies in the exceptional value that we offer to consumers. We have continued our efforts to improve and upgrade our network, which in the capital and surrounding areas is extremely strong, and we continue to work on improving it in the adjacent regions as well. Coupled with this solid network, we also have a highly attractive portfolio of tariff plans, which lets consumers find a plan that matches their usage, thus delivering exceptional value. I think that people who have had their numbers for a long time and would like to keep them will be interested in taking a good look at us.</p><h4>How are your efforts at improving connectivity in rural areas progressing?</h4><p>In the regions, we have expanded the number of base stations in the network, and are also employing some of the latest technologies in the world to provide better coverage. During 2014, and in particular in 2Q2014, I think that consumers will see the effects of the efforts we have made over the past six to nine months. These new technologies will allow us better control of our radio signal in the base stations, thereby giving us a broader reach. It will also allow us to take advantage of additional base stations.</p><h4>What progress has Nar Mobile been able to make in terms of increasing its customer base?</h4><p>I can illustrate this with three facts. The first is that our subscriber base grew by more than 10%, and I am fairly certain that we are the only operator that posted this kind of growth in 2013. Our revenue was also up by roughly 25%, which outpaced the growth of our two competitors combined. Meanwhile, our data traffic, which will increasingly be a key driver of telecoms revenue in the future, saw an increase of 130% in a single year. All three are outstanding indicators of the kind of growth that we have seen and of the number of customers that are already moving to Nar Mobile. That is why we are particularly optimistic as we continue to focus on the fundamentals. We have a great network, and offer real value and customer service. On the customer service side, we have seen a dramatic jump in our customer satisfaction ratings over the past year. This is an area that we are emphasizing and want to improve further.</p><h4>What initiatives best articulate Nar Mobile's drive for innovation?</h4><p>Innovation is not always about the newest product; it is also about providing a set of services and tariffs uniquely. We have simplified our portfolio, meaning that we have six tariffs for voice, within which we can meet any basic needs that consumers might have. If you want a simple price, for everything, then Unique is the tariff for you, because it only costs four kopeck for any domestic call. If you want to talk to many people on the Nar network, we offer an unlimited tariff, which for a few kopecks a day delivers outstanding value. We find that consumers absolutely flock to this tariff, as it is one of the most stable we offer. Beyond tariffs, we announced a truly important initiative at Bakutel, namely Nar Home. With this, we will be enabling a number of services in the home including television, video libraries, home monitoring, and a home network, allowing people in the same home to talk to each other through the set-top box.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate the performance of Holcim's Azerbaijani operations in 2013?<br></h4><p>We achieved our production, sales, customer satisfaction, and employee development targets. Moreover, this success was not only registered within Azerbaijan itself, but throughout the global Holcim Group. We have ensured our leading position through the development and growth of the Azerbaijani economy and its attractive business climate. In addition, we are strong partners for the various international projects of Holcim. Currently, we coordinate the Holcim Awards competition, which is open for projects that champion sustainable construction. Many people from Azerbaijan will be interested and keen to participate. Meanwhile, we have invested much time and energy into the training of our employees in occupational health and safety, aiming at a zero-accident level at our plant. All of our activities enable us to be a customer-focused and cost-efficient company with the highest standards of safety, personal development, and social dialogue.</p><h4>Holcim's dedication to environmental protection is recognized worldwide. How has the company brought its expertise in this field to Azerbaijan?</h4><p>As a member of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), we are united in our commitment to sustainable development via the three pillars of economic growth, ecological balance, and social progress. In 2000, Holcim was a co-founder of the Cement Sustainability Initiative (CSI) helping the cement industry to address the challenges of sustainable development, and has been listed in the FTSE4Good Sustainability Index and confirmed as a member of the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for a decade. Holcim is dedicated to the continual improvement of environmental performance. Cement production is a resource- and energy-intensive process that requires sustainable solutions. Eco-efficiency is therefore at the heart of our business. By reducing the resources used in production and minimizing waste, we aim to be at the forefront of the drive toward to a more sustainable construction industry. In general, 2013 was a turning point in the history of construction in Azerbaijan. Construction of the modern state-of-the-art plant was finalized, and this production facility has been completely modernized, having replaced the existing four old wet kiln lines with a single new dry kiln line. The new dry kiln consumes 50% less energy than its predecessors, emits 50 times less dust, and decreases water consumption by 500,000 cubic meters annually.</p><h4>In addition to its environmental activities, community development is part and parcel of your operations in Azerbaijan, particularly as it pertains to educating its youth. What were your main initiatives in this area in 2013, and what are you looking to achieve in this regard in 2014?</h4><p>Holcim Azerbaijan is one of the pioneers of corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities in the Azerbaijani business environment. The CSR program is aimed at bringing benefits for the sustainable development of the country and cementing the foundations for the future development of its people. We have established a Community Advisory Panel in the Garadagh region. Through formal dialogue sessions, open days, and local partnerships we participate in building prosperity for communities. Our company established various centers: the Youth Development Center, the Employment Center, and the Center for Rehabilitation of Children with Special Needs are all the success stories of Holcim Group Companies. The Employment Center provides various services, including career planning, access to the labor market, and workshops on access to targeted social aid programs. In operation since August 2011, more than 1,200 people have applied to the organization, 193 people have found full-time employment, 950 people have taken part in seminars, and 60 people have received targeted social aid.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What success has the Ministry had in furthering environmental protection in the country?</h4><p>The Republic of Azerbaijan has achieved dramatic positive changes in the area of social and economic development. The country's environmental strategy is aimed at preserving natural resources at the national, regional, and international levels through the application of scientifically substantiated development principles and the sustainable use of Azerbaijan's economic and human resources. Through our work, we aim to meet the interests of existing and future generations by enhancing the coordination of activities in the area of environmental protection. Having achieved independence and adopted a market economy, the national environmental policy regarding environmental protection started to evolve with a new spirit in the Republic of Azerbaijan. One of the main documents of reference regarding national environmental policy is the Environmental Concept of the Republic of Azerbaijan, which was developed under sustainable development principles. The concept reflects the main guidelines for the resolution of pressing issues in terms of protecting the environment. The main objective of Azerbaijan's environmental policy is to ensure sustainable development through the protection of existing eco systems and economic capacity, and the efficient use of natural resources in order to meet the needs of the current and future generations. In order to achieve this objective, efficient ways to best utilize natural resources should be developed and economic development should be ensured with sustainability in mind.</p><h4>What are the main priorities of Azerbaijan's environmental policy?</h4><p>The first priority is to utilize modern methods based on the principles of sustainable development in order to regulate environmental protection and minimize pollution. The second priority is the efficient use of natural resources in order to meet the needs of existing and future generations, all while developing renewable energy sources and achieving energy efficiency. The third priority is the assessment of national requirements in regard to global environmental problems, the identification of ways to resolve such problems, the broadening of cooperation with international organizations, and the implementation of environmental policies through the utilization of national capacity.</p><h4>To what extent does the Ministry collaborate with foreign institutions on national and global environmental issues?</h4><p>As a manifestation of environmental polices in the Republic of Azerbaijan, we oversaw the development of relevant legislative framework in accordance with European standards, the improvement of the state environmental management system, and the gradual realization of priority projects through broadened ties with international organizations. Furthermore, augmented efforts aimed at the promotion of the environment among the public and an increased amount of classroom time on issues related to the protection of the environment and ecology in secondary schools are essential. A number of laws on environmental protection adopted by parliament over recent years have created immense opportunities for filling existing gaps in this area. The Ministry of Ecology &amp; Natural Resources puts special emphasis on broadening ties with international organizations and donor countries for the resolution of current problems. Hence, cooperation with UNDP, UNEP, NATO, the Global Environment Facility, the OECD, the Economic Cooperation Organization, the Asian Development Bank, and the WWF, as well as other organizations, continues at pace. Furthermore, bilateral ties are being established with developed countries based on relevant agreements. Joining international conventions in the area of environmental protection is also a priority. Azerbaijan is party to 20 international environmental conventions.</p><h4>What is the extent of Azerbaijan's mineral resources?</h4><p>Azerbaijan is a resource-rich country that boasts 867 deposits of industrial importance, including 61 ore reserves, 126 with non-ore resources, 579 deposits with materials used in construction, and 101 units of underground water resources. The efficient use of water resources for the improvement of human welfare is an integral part of socio-economic reforms. Successful results have been achieved in the exploration of subsoil for raw material supply. Thanks to successful policies implemented by the President, the wide application of modern technologies and the upgrading of mining equipment has become a reality. Resources from 192 different deposits have been added to the balance over the past 10 years in 25 regions of Azerbaijan. Relevant measures were also implemented in 2013 by the Ministry of Ecology &amp; Natural Resources for the exploration and prospecting for mineral deposits, which, all in all, has secured the long-term prospects of the mining sector. Today, domestic demand for construction materials and non-ore raw materials is fully covered by the newly discovered deposits. Demand for materials also forms the basis of our short-to long-term exploration plans. The demand for materials in the construction sector is also regulated by state programs on socio-economic development. Compliance with environmental requirements is strictly observed at all mining sites, and monitoring is carried out to assess waste management, and the condition of soil, air, and water. Scientific research and staff capacity are the main factors behind the success we have achieved in natural resources exploration. The Institute of Raw Materials under the Ministry of Ecology &amp; Natural Resources is responsible for studying strategically important mineral resources and preparing relevant strategic documents. Joint activities on the application of environmental science-based technologies are carried out within the framework of cooperation with international organizations.</p><h4>Can you give specific examples of actions the Ministry has undertaken to prevent deforestation?</h4><p>The particular attention paid by the country's leadership to environmental protection has provided a great impetus to preservation-related initiatives. Large-scale environmental works have been successfully carried out with positive and tangible results. A significant number of large-scale green projects have been realized in the arid zones of Baku and the Absheron peninsula. More than 3,472 trees were planted over an area of 3,322 hectares, and modern drip irrigation systems provided. This irrigation system was installed on 9,000 kilometers of road characterized as semi-desert and arid. Up to 845,000 olive saplings were also planted in various regions covering an area of 1,384 hectares. And in order to boost effectiveness in such areas, a modern desalination plant has been constructed with a total daily capacity of 20 cubic meters. The resulting desalinated sea water has been used for the irrigation of green areas. Furthermore, another desalination unit with a capacity of 2,500 cubic meters per day was installed in the Shirvan channel for the irrigation of roadside greenery.</p><h4>How do you anticipate the country's environmental strategy developing in the medium term?</h4><p>Based on statistics covering environmental projects carried out over the past decade, it's clear to see that we have seen great success alongside economic growth. The rapid development of the economy as well as the successful implementation of the national oil strategy has created excellent opportunities for tackling environmental problems. The government's environmental policy is aimed at ensuring the rights of people to live in a healthy environment. The up-to-date and flexible management of environmental issues is the result of the wise and purposeful policy pursued by the President. To better solve issues arising from the Azerbaijan 2020: Vision of the Future development concept, a state program on the improvement of the environment and the rational use of natural resources in 2014-2020 has been prepared. This document analyzes achievements in the field of environmental protection and institutional change, and underlines the tasks to be implemented over the coming years. The implementation of measures outlined in the program is based on progressive methods and the principles of sustainable development.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the main advances in transportation and infrastructure development made over 2013?</h4><p>The achievements made in all other spheres of life in the Republic of Azerbaijan have also benefited the transport sector. Effective measures continued in 2013 to further improve the activities of the sector. According to the state programs and action plans approved by the relevant orders of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan, specific measures have been taken to develop all spheres of the transport sector. In an effort to create a modern national transport system, simplify transportation, ensure safety, meet the overall demand for quality transport services, and, in general, improve the level of transportation services, the implementation of projects in this sector has been accelerated. The reconstruction of railways and roads of national and local importance, the modernization of existing road infrastructure, the establishment of new infrastructure facilities, the development of international transport corridors passing through the territory of Azerbaijan, the implementation of the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway project, the new Baku international trade seaport and other large-scale initiatives, the modernization of the transport system in Baku, the renewal of vehicle fleet, and other similar activities have contributed to the comprehensive development of the transport sector. In addition to the commodities transported through pipelines in 2013, a total of 160 million tons of cargo was transported in the road transport sector, which is 4.3% above the 2012 figure. Meanwhile, passenger transportation has increased by 6.7%. The railway network accounted for 23.2 million tons, maritime for 11.8 million tons, and road vehicles for 125 million tons. Loading and offloading operations involving 12.4 million tons were carried out at ports, while the share of international transportation reached 10.5 million tons for the year. A total of 1.5 million passengers were transported by automobiles, 2.4 million by railway, and 1.7 million by air.</p><h4>As a point of connection and passage between Asia and Europe and an important link on routes such as TRACECA and the Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP), how do you expect Azerbaijan's importance to East-West relations to increase over the coming years?</h4><p>The construction of the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway, which plays a major role in the development of the region and the whole of Europe alongside the exiting oil and gas pipelines, connects East with West and is expected to become a new commercial junction in Eurasia. With development in full swing, the upper structure on an 18.6-kilometer stretch of the 29-kilometer Akhalkalaki-Turkish border section has already been constructed, with a new road to the Turkish border to be built before the end of this year. A 2.2-kilometer stretch of the 4.2-kilometer tunnel on the Turkish-Georgian border has been built in Turkey and a 200-meter section in Georgia. Although the difficult terrain and severe weather conditions on Turkish and Georgian territory have caused slight delays to the project schedule, construction will be completed by the end of 2014. In the first 11 months of 2013, a total of 53.6 million tons of cargo was transported along the Europe-Caucasus-Asia international transport corridor. Of this, 19.3 million tons were carried by railway, 9.4 million tons by sea, and 24.9 million tons by automobiles. Transit goods transported along the corridor accounted for 13.4 million tons. Of those transited goods, 6 million tons were carried by railway and 7.4 million tons by maritime transport.</p><h4>The construction of the new Baku Shipyard was recently completed. What will this development mean for maritime transport in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>The volume of maritime freight traffic has declined by 5.7% to 11.8 million tons in comparison with the previous year. The number of transported passengers was 14,300, while freight turnover reached 4,698.2 million ton-kilometers and passenger turnover 5.2 million passenger-kilometers. Certain works were realized to renew and expand the capacity of the Caspian Shipping Company's fleet. Its shipyard was also inaugurated in a ceremony on March 4, 2013 and the plant is now in operation. The construction of the biggest and most sophisticated international trade port in the Caspian basin is underway in Alat, near Baku. Dredging work has already been completed on an area of 7.5 kilometers in length, with a 6.6 meter draft, and 165 meter width, including the canal and maneuvering area. Construction work is now in progress on the ground. The design of the road infrastructure linking the port to the highway and construction of a railway line to the port has virtually been finalized. Landfill and pump drainage work is currently underway at the port's cargo terminal. The excavation of 1,500-mm pits, the construction of an enclosure, and piling activities are ongoing at the ferryboat terminal of the port. Phase I of the port, including the ferryboat terminal, is scheduled for completion in 2014, and a total of AZN109.4 million has been invested in the project. The completion of all these activities on this segment of the East-West corridor will transform Azerbaijan into a major transit and logistical center.</p><div class="quote">“  The construction of the biggest and most sophisticated international trade port in the Caspian basin is underway in Alat, near Baku. "</div><h4>How crucial is the development of Azerbaijan Airlines and Heydar Aliyev Airport to Azerbaijan's status as a transport hub?</h4><p>The volume of cargo carried by air has doubled compared to last year's figure to reach 121,700 tons. Passenger transportation by air has also increased by 6.2% to 1.7 million people. Cargo and passenger turnover made up 44,195 million ton-kilometers and 2,598.4 million passenger-kilometers, respectively. In an effort to modernize air transport infrastructure, Azerbaijan Airlines has purchased four Embraer 190 and two Embraer 170 passenger aircraft and continued the construction of a new terminal building at Heydar Aliyev International Airport. In addition, the Yevlakh Airport has been re-commissioned after a major overhaul, while the area surrounding the airport has been landscaped and a car park built. Continuing the policy of infrastructure modernization, a new building at the air traffic control center was commissioned at the Heydar Aliyev International Airport on October 2, 2013. The construction of the new airport terminal building is close to completion. This will make the Heydar Aliyev International Airport one of the most sophisticated in the world.</p><h4>What are the main initiatives the Ministry is set to undertake in 2014?</h4><p>The Azerbaijan 2020 development concept, which was approved by decree of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan, dated December 29, 2012, envisages the further modernization of the country's transport, transit, and logistical infrastructure, the sustainable development of the country's regions, the effective management of local and international transportation, the integration of the country's transport system into that of the wider world, the improvement of transportation services provided to the population, and the application of state-of-the-art technologies in the system of payment on public transport. With this in mind, an action plan regarding the development of the system of automobile transport in the Republic of Azerbaijan has been prepared. The Ministry of Transport is now receiving feedback from other government ministries regarding the proposed action plan. Additionally, an action plan on road transport infrastructure has been approved in order to ensure the smooth and safe operation of public transport and address other organizational matters ahead of the inaugural European Games due to be held in Baku in 2015. This action plan covers the operation of highways, the intelligent transport management system, and the railway network. In the time remaining before the European Games, the Tbilisi, Babak, and Ziya Bunyadov avenues are to be reconstructed, and a new road is to be built to the Aquatic Palace, while the stretch of Mikayil Aliyev Street from Koroglu underground station to Babak Avenue is to be overhauled. The entire work on the streets and avenues adjacent to the venues of the Games are scheduled for completion by May 1, 2015. The section of the plan relating to the intelligent transport management system dictates that Wi-Fi systems will be installed at bus stops in Baku in 2014 and in 1Q2015, vehicles carrying visiting delegations will be equipped with GPS systems, while special shuttle services will be organized between the Heydar Aliyev Airport, the Olympic village, and other activity venues of the Games. Measures will also be taken to limit daylight construction and reconstruction activities in Baku, while the working hours of bus services in Baku will be extended to 2.00 am for the entire duration of the Games.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The much anticipated Baku-Tbilisi-Kars (BTK) railway is due for completion by the end of 2014. How has the project progressed, and how will it improve the regional railway transportation of goods and people?</h4><p>By joining the BTK new railway project, Azerbaijan has taken yet another step calculated for the future. I would like to note from the outset that in addition to the economic benefits the project entails, the BTK railway project is important from the standpoint of reaffirming Azerbaijan's central role in the region. Talks on the BTK railway began during a meeting of a joint Turkish-Georgian transport commission held in Ankara in July 1993. The logical culmination of project-related negotiations was the signing of the agreement on a start to the construction of the BTK railway, which took place during a working visit by the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, to Georgia on February 7, 2007. The construction of the Georgian section of the BTK railway was launched at Marabda station in Georgia's Tetri-Skari region on November 21, 2007 and the Turkish stretch of the railway in the city of Kars on July 24, 2008. The new BTK railway project involves construction, rehabilitation, and reconstruction operations on the Marabda-Turkish border (Kartsakhi), and the Marabda-Akhalkalaki areas, and construction operations on the Akhalkalaki-Turkish border. Construction on the Turkish section of a 4.35-kilometer tunnel to connect Georgia with Turkey has already been completed. The length of the Georgian section of the tunnel is 2.07 kilometers, with construction still in progress. At the end of the ceremony, the heads of delegations from all three countries made the first welding seam on the railway using the KSM-005 mobile welding car. Azerbaijan has allocated to its neighboring countries a low-interest loan of $775 million for a period of 25 years. The first carriages are expected to start traveling along the BTK railway at the end of 2014, while the railway will become fully operational in 2015. The President of the Republic of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, has always attached a special importance to the construction of the BTK railway. He has said, “We are creating major infrastructure projects. The construction of the BTK railway is powering ahead. This project will connect continents. It will be a project linking Europe with Asia." Initially, the railway is expected to transport 5 million tons of cargo per year, while in subsequent years the figure will rise to 15 million tons.</p><h4>To what extent has innovation improved railway transport?</h4><p>According to the Order “On approving the State Program on the development of the railway transport system in the Republic of Azerbaijan for 2010-2014," signed by the President on July 6, 2010, the process of replacing the automated signaling system with a microprocessor operated from a single control room has been launched. The system will enable technical and visual control over the movement of carriages, provide a direct communication link with the rolling stock personnel, facilitate the installation of safety devices to detect the overheating of rail car wheels, and ensure the complete automation of railway-automobile crossings. Bidding for the upgrade of the signaling and communication systems of the railway was announced in the latter half of 2013 and Swiss company Bombardier was declared the winner. In November-December 2013, Azerbaijan Railways and Bombardier experts jointly prepared the scope of Phase I of the Boyuk Kasik-Ganja section. The work is currently in the design and installation stage.</p><h4>As a key part of Transport Corridor Europe-Caucasus-Asia (TRACECA), Azerbaijan is poised to benefit from increased regional trade. Based on the results of 2013, what has been the change in demand for cargo carried through Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Azerbaijan is favorably located at the crossroads of this shortest transport link between Europe and Asia. National Leader Heydar Aliyev appreciated the importance for the nation of transport sector development. Therefore, in September 1998, Baku hosted an international conference on the restoration of the Great Silk Road, which was attended by heads of nine states (Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Romania, Turkey, Uzbekistan, and Ukraine), representatives of 13 international organizations, and delegations from a total of 32 countries. The Main Multilateral Agreement on the development of the Europe-Caucasus-Asia international transport corridor was signed on the basis of the TRACECA program and the Baku Declaration was adopted. Azerbaijan Railways is interested in increasing the volume of transit goods transported along the TRACECA corridor. The stable increase of transit volumes and the attraction of new cargo are among our top priorities. In order to enhance our competitiveness in comparison with alternative transport corridors of other countries, Azerbaijan Railways maintains effective cooperation with major carriers, legal entities, and private individuals, and applies a number of discount tariffs to the transit of oil and oil products. The Main Multilateral Agreement on the development of the Europe-Caucasus-Asia international transport corridor governs the discounts applied to the goods carried by railway. The concessions applied to the goods transported along the TRACECA corridor are largely determined by the volume and duration of transit.</p><h4>How will the country's railway network contribute to the development of the energy sector and benefit from higher trade levels?</h4><p>The signing of the Shah Deniz II final investment decision (FID) had a positive impact on the development of Azerbaijan's energy sector and boosted the country's importance in the energy market. This, in turn, means that the volume of oil and oil products transported by rail will increase in the near future. The transportation of such products is mainly carried out through the East-West corridor. In order to meet the growing demand and ensure the safety of transportation, a total of 317 kilometers of main railway lines have been overhauled in Azerbaijan according to the state program on the development of railways in 2010-2014. A project currently being upgraded is the signaling and communication systems, which is underway now. Naturally, the increased transit volume of oil and oil products will generate greater revenues for the railway system.</p><h4>To what extent is your institution seeking to interconnect the railway network with ports and roads to facilitate the transportation of goods?</h4><p>At a time when intermodal transportation has become widespread, the railway administration has been doing consistent work to keep pace. The construction of the Baku International Trade Seaport has begun an on area of 400 hectares in Alat. The port will play a pivotal role in handling transit goods proceeding along the East-West and North-South international transport corridors and in receiving and transporting key goods required by the national economy. The construction of the new port will be carried out in three stages. The completion of the first stage will enable the transportation of up to 10 million tons of cargo and 40,000 TEUs. The second phase will facilitate the transportation of up to 17 million tons of cargo and 150,000 TEUs, while the third phase will provide for the transportation of up to 25 million tons of cargo and 1 million TEUs. The construction of the first stage of the port is scheduled for completion in July 2014. Therefore, in light of the fact that up to 25 million tons of cargo will be processed by the Baku International Trade Seaport in the near future, work is now underway to expand the throughput capacity of the Alat and Yeni Alat stations. Talks regarding the design of the stations are currently under way with the relevant government agencies. The commissioning of the Baku International Trade Seaport provides an impetus to the development of the associated railway infrastructure.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you expect the recent signing of the Shah Deniz final investment decision to impact the logistics sector and Cross Caspian?</h4><p>While the impact of this decision on Cross Caspian is hard to assess at this point in time, it comes as great news for the entire sector and for the country in so much as it will open up opportunities to export large volumes of condensate to Black Sea ports. It is also a marked achievement by the key players of the energy sector in Azerbaijan as the sector will continue to develop and attract interest and investments. Further expertise in the energy sector will be developed and, what is more, Azerbaijan will contribute to securing energy stability for international markets in the long run. In that sense, it is a significant achievement for all stakeholders.</p><h4>The Baku-Tbilisi-Kars (BTK) rail project is shortly to be completed. Are you looking to include it in your network?</h4><p>In terms of logistics, the greater the diversification, the more opportunities for shipment you can offer. In other words, in any region intending to transport significant volumes of commodities, the development of a hub is crucial so that you can offer inward and outward shipment in numerous directions. This project is therefore a great opportunity to diversify and extend our reach via rail. At the same time, it is possible for us to encourage inward shipments, which could provide much interest and the necessary structures to handle inflows of cargo from Kazakhstan. We are mostly an oil and gas transportation company, but do also look attentively at developments in dry cargo as this is a related market, and the two industries affect each other. Azerbaijan is increasingly becoming a regional leader in terms of its transportation and logistics infrastructure.</p><h4>How have Cross Caspian's operations developed in recent years?</h4><p>We aim for sustainable growth, and therefore pursue gradual expansion. We are now in the process of completing the first phase of a terminal that exports some of the Shah Deniz condensate, a project that began back in 2008. We are working on interconnections with the terminal, and the facility is shaping up well. We are also working to acquire additional private railcars. The corridor itself has around 4,000 rail cars, but we are working on bringing in newer ones. We work in the private sphere; of those 4,000, around 1,500 are private freight stock and we are working to bring in a further 1,000. There is the feeling that in the long run, a modern system should be managed by private companies. In 2013, the capacity of the corridor was at between 12 million and 14 million tons by rail. The cargo overhaul for hydrocarbons was at around 10 million tons for the year. A significant volume of crude oil was shipped via BTC to the BTC entry point, which is understandable given that the BTC is a unique asset and very well placed geographically. It is a high-quality and modern pipeline managed by leading companies. Azerbaijan is an extremely stable and visionary player in the region, which attracts shippers, and ultimately the BTC provides very good returns to those who invest. That is why when considering the transit figures, you should combine the BTC transit figures with those of rail. We have increased our volume significantly, and the total volume of BTC transit exceeded 5 million tons. When you combine figures shipped via rail and through the BTC, overall we note good progress. It was tough work because we were taking on a few things for the first time, such as delivering different grades into the same pipeline at the same delivery point. It is quite an efficient arrangement both technically and commercially.</p>]]></richbody0content>

In recent months, we have built a restaurant complex, a four-kilometer long boulevard, beaches, and entry gates to the project, as well as a sports complex, and have laid out parks. We are planning to inaugurate our first restaurant complex, the Stingray, on May 28, 2014, the national day of Azerbaijan, which is an important accomplishment for us as we have worked hard on this project. Over the next two years, we are planning to complete more construction and carry out several opening ceremonies, as well as hand over keys in residential schemes. The deadline for completing the entire complex is 2030.</p><h4>What would you say are the key logistical aspects of the project and how are you addressing them?</h4><p>Our priority is to employ the latest technologies and most durable materials in our project in meeting high international standards. The safety and comfort of our customers is key to what we do. For that reason, we will not be using any cement in the project, but rather will rely on marble and stone that we procure ourselves. Another important aspect is to ensure our staff is comprised of highly skilled employees through a thorough interview and selection process. We now have a team of over 3,000 professionals. Thirdly, securing funding is an important consideration that we address through negotiations with foreign investors, both abroad and at home, to familiarize them with the project. These efforts will all contribute to the development of future partnerships.</p><h4>You are about to launch the sales campaign for the 12 residential buildings already completed. What customer base are you targeting?</h4><p>We are open to both local and foreign customers, which we hope to welcome with attractive financing options such as mortgages without down payments and interest-free loans.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were Yeni Hayat's most important projects in 2013?<br></h4><p>Yeni Hayat Group started operating in 2002, and ever since the first day our main guiding principle has been customer satisfaction. Our residential complexes, shopping, and entertainment centers fully comply with the wishes and needs of the customers in terms of their price-quality ratio. Yeni Hayat Group is one of the leading companies in Azerbaijan's construction market from the standpoint of quality, location, design, and complexity. Yeni Hayat has built some of the architectural and construction gems of Baku, such as the Yeni Hayat Residence, Yeni Hayat Plaza, and the Azure Complex, which comprises the Azure Residence, Azure Business Center, and MegaFun entertainment center.</p><h4>In light of the company's extensive experience in residential construction, what characterizes Yeni Hayat's residential concept?</h4><p>One of the key contributors to the success of the Yeni Hayat Group has been its approach to customers' needs and expectations. Before embarking on any project, we try to identify what customers in this particular market segment tend to expect and require. At the construction stage, we provide even higher quality than the customer may expect. In addition to the above, we remain committed to this approach at the selling stage and try to provide the best possible value for people's money.</p><h4>Yeni Hayat is recognized for its support of Azerbaijani sports, and the Olympic team in particular. Seeing how the country will host the first edition of the European Games in 2015, what are your plans in this area?</h4><p>The inaugural European Games will be held in Baku in 2015 and will be held once every four years thereafter. I want to emphasize that it is our duty as an Azerbaijani company to contribute to the development of our country in any sphere. Our interest in and support for the Olympic team stems from our confidence in our athletes. We believe that our sportsmen will successfully represent our country and raise our national flag. We as Yeni Hayat Group feel proud of our athletes and are always ready to support the national team.</p><h4>What projects are you planning for 2014-2015?</h4><p>The ongoing construction of the Park Azure residential complex is expected to be completed by September 2015. Furthermore, the Grand Hayat complex, which offers customers innovative designs, will also be inaugurated in this period. For 2014, we have also planned the inauguration of one of our most ambitious projects, namely Hayat Palace.</p><h4>President Aliyev was voted in for a third term in office last year. What do you expect this third term to bring for the real estate sector?</h4><p>Over the past several years Azerbaijan has become one of the fastest growing nations across the globe. The economy has grown 3.4 times. Some of the primary reasons for that are the reforms under way in the country, stability, and public order. Of course, this stability is a product of President Ilham Aliyev's activities. It has also created favorable conditions for the economic development of Azerbaijan. The President has always been very supportive of private enterprise development, and we are confident that this support will continue to be provided in the interests of further dynamic development of our country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

In September, we successfully commenced cement production at our plant, and in October, after ensuring the quality of our product, we started to market it. Over the course of 2014, we expect to increase the range of grades and achieve full production capacity.</p><h4>What led to the establishment of Norm?</h4><p>The construction industry in Azerbaijan is one of the fastest growing industries today. It has become one of the driving forces of the country's economic development. A growing need increased the investments aimed at cement production and stimulated Norm to implement the Norm Cement plant project. When the company was established, Azerbaijan was importing 65% of its cement needs either in direct cement or clinker form. In the cement industry, clinker is a core input. Once you produce clinker, you can grind it into cement or else sell it directly as a product. Currently, the installed capacity of Azerbaijan can meet just 35% of demand, meaning that 65% was imported from neighboring countries, mainly Iran. This was one of the driving forces behind our construction of the plant. Another driving force was to bring up the quality of cement in Azerbaijan.</p><h4>What are the special features of the plant?</h4><p>The Norm Cement plant is the largest cement plant in the South Caucasus. The capacity of plant is 5,000 tons of clinker per day and 2 million tons of cement a year. The plant, constructed in the Garadagh district of Baku, is designed according to the most advanced European technology. The main process equipment of the plant is supplied from leading manufacturers in Germany, France, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and other EU countries. The cutting-edge technologies and equipment will ensure high quality, safety, and efficiency, as well as minimize fuel and power consumption while preserving the most stringent European and global ecological standards. The project, one of the largest in terms of investments in the non-oil sector, will cost $350 million and provide immense social and economic benefits.</p><h4>What measures are taken for environmental protection?</h4><p>In the cement industry the biggest pollution comes from dust emission. The proper control of dust emissions requires significant investment in technology and environmental protection equipment. At the Norm Cement plant, the entire production line is equipped with modern dust filters. Air quality is continuously monitored by the optical measuring devices installed in all sources of dust according to the strictest standards. The allowable dust emission by EU standards is 35 mg per cubic meter, while filters installed at our plant ensure 30 mg/cubic meter or less. The plant is equipped with a strict noise protection system to comply with another EU standard of 85 dB maximum noise at 1 meter from the source. The application of the latest technologies ensures the operation of the plant in accordance with European and international environmental norms.</p><h4>What sectors account for the bulk of your portfolio?</h4><p>In Azerbaijan, there is roughly an equal three-way distribution between residential, infrastructure, and non-residential construction. A total of 4.5 million tons of cement is consumed in Azerbaijan. We want to be present in all the segments of the cement market, including infrastructure, residential, and non-residential. By the end of 2014, we will have a large portfolio of products targeted at all cement segments. The Norm Cement plant will also supply the oil industry of Azerbaijan and of the whole Caspian region with oil-well cement that complies with the standards of the American Petroleum Institute. We will start producing this type of cement for the oil industry at the beginning of 2015.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the volume of assets under management (AUM) in Colombia's fiduciary sector changed over the past few years?</h4><p>When one uses AUM to assess the development of the sector, one must understand that it is possible to have a high volume of AUM with a very low turnover. For this reason, it is better to talk about commissions, the number of operations you manage, and the volume. Thus, AUM is a good tool to evaluate the fund management sector. The trustee sector experienced a very interesting trend in 2013; the volume of operations rose, but at the same time income volume fell. That was due to a loss in the net asset value (NAV) of funds experienced last March, after which many people retrieved their investments. At the same time, there was a crisis of sorts in the entire public trustee segment. Therefore, we saw a very important reduction in commissions from the public segment, as well as those from fund management. In this context, we are a trustee firm with slightly different processes, and 2013 was a very good one for us in terms of growth and profit. The sector tends to be much more linked to the fund management segment, whereas we have a higher participation in the trustee line.</p><h4>What type of trustee companies can foreign investors find in Colombia?</h4><p>It depends very much on the type of business investors want to focus on. For example, if they target infrastructure, then they should look for a trustee bank, as they have a wide knowledge of the sector and impressive capacities. However, if the business requires management operations, then it would be better to resort to an independent trustee company. I think it is also important to keep in mind the location of the trustee firm, as this is key to knowing in which area you want to focus your activity.</p><div class="quote">“The return an investor can expect from the real estate sector naturally enough depends on the level of risk they assume."</div><h4>How significant is the real estate business for the company's overall activity?</h4><p>We enjoy a strong position in the real estate market. The real estate sector brings together certain elements that are key for us, such as being able to target diverse investor types, from very small to multinational, depending on the stage of each project. This sector also enables us to manage operations and activities with different risk profiles. Our role is to facilitate a constructor's access to different markets. We are an independent trustee firm that has the capability to access the market in different ways and target different types of investors. Our clients have a long-term vision and aim to hold assets for a long time period, meaning less rotation and speculation.</p><h4>What is the potential of the Colombian real estate sector when it comes to attracting foreign investors?</h4><p>The return an investor can expect from the real estate sector naturally enough depends on the level of risk they assume. Having said that, Colombia is a very attractive market with high growth levels; unemployment levels are on the decline, which brings more people with purchasing power to the market, fuelling the urban reconstruction that many cities are undergoing.</p><h4>What impact does the governments' regulatory reform have on Colombia's asset management sector?</h4><p>The asset management industry is mainly a fixed-income market, as the country has historically suffered from high levels of inflation. At the same time, other markets, such as derivatives, are only in their infancy. The evolution of this industry will be linked to large investors. Regarding the reform, it has barely just come into force, and we should keep in mind that it was developed with special attention to those companies that aim to become active industry players. Nevertheless, I do believe we will begin to see new and more specialized products reaching the market.</p><h4>What projects have you been most proud of?</h4><p>We are especially proud of the fiduciary rights-based projects we have developed over the years at Acción Fiduciaria—in other words, those popularly known as crowd funding. Thanks to groups of small investors, we have been able to carry out many large projects that have become very important for the history of Colombia.</p><h4>What's the strategic reason behind your expansion to Panama?</h4><p>To put it simply, we wanted to become a bilingual company, and expand our activities; we had many projects priced in Colombian pesos and realized that we needed to expand to markets that use the US dollar. Colombia still has some bureaucratic barriers when it comes to dealing with US dollar-based projects. We see Panama as a country that can help us attract further small international investors and showcase Colombia's developments to the world.</p><h4>Where do you see Acción Fiduciaria in five years time?</h4><p>Our priorities for the next few years include developing new markets for investors interested in fiduciary rights-based projects; also, as the public-private partnership (PPP) model becomes more popular, trustee companies will have the challenge of providing solutions to investors. We also believe that private banking will become widely common over the next few years and perceive considerable potential there.</p><h4>How can the trustee industry benefit from the Pacific Alliance?</h4><p>It is a very interesting initiative, because, apart from Chile, the remaining countries have a trustee industry that is very much institutionalized. I think there's a potential for trustee networks between countries and common alliances to benefit regional clients. We should be able to develop a common regulatory framework to better attract investors. The concept is suitable for countries operating similar economic models, and the road ahead is promising, if challenging.</p><h4>Would Europe be an interesting market for Acción Fiduciaria to expand its activities to?</h4><p>We are currently holding talks to try to show our European counterparts in Spain and Italy the benefits of the Latin American model. Chief among them is its greater flexibility when it comes to tackling financial crises that would render them much more dynamic in their current conditions, especially as these economies advance on the road toward recovery.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does Tanzania play in Citibank's global strategy?</h4><p>Tanzania is an important market for Citibank in terms of the manner in which we have expanded from the outset. Globally we are a 201-year-old establishment, and from the early days our expansion and footprint has followed industry trends and client needs. As our clients became regional and global, we too have expanded into those same geographies to cater to their requirements. We have had a presence in Africa for almost 100 years. Tanzania presents a very unique combination of opportunities to our clients, stemming from its size, with nearly 50 million inhabitants, its geographic location bordering eight countries, its economic diversity and stability, and its political maturity. And, with sustained GDP growth of 7% for the last 10 years, and prospects of even faster growth in the future underpinned by new industries coming on stream, reforms, and integration in the East Africa Community, among other factors, the country should become even more important to Citi over time.</p><h4>How does Citibank leverage its international reach to improve its services in Tanzania?</h4><p>What really makes us unique is the fact that we leverage our global platforms, products, and infrastructure so as to offer the same banking experience wherever we operate. Combined with our global footprint and reach we have local on-the-ground knowledge, which allows us to offer our clients the best possible solutions. Subject to local regulations, we are able to bring our global services and products to our clients, which is a real advantage. It also allows us to leverage investment in new products, infrastructure, technology, and security.</p><div class="quote">“The long-term strategy is to be able to service this market as it matures."</div><h4>How does Citibank view the rapidly rising mobile money trend in Tanzania?</h4><p>Whilst Citibank's focus is on institutional banking, we see the rising mobile money trend as an opportunity that is about using technology as a means of servicing our clients from a transaction banking perspective. Furthermore, there is the aspect of financial inclusion. Although we do not play directly to the consumer side of banking in this market, we have done so indirectly through our involvement in mobile banking as we have been a key player in this sector from its inception. Citibank was at the forefront of developing technological solutions for mobile operators and also of playing a role in terms of dialogue between operators and regulators to take things where they are today, in both Tanzania and Kenya. For us, mobile money is about technology that allows for greater financial inclusion through the provision of a cost-effective means of payment to individuals, as well as an alternative payment/collection channel for our institutional clients.</p><h4>Citibank is currently being consulted by the government in preparation for its debut Eurobond offering. How does risk assessment here differ from other African countries?</h4><p>Citibank does not perform risk assessments in the context of rating advisory, but we do assist governments in preparing for the due diligence that rating agencies perform. We help sovereigns to prepare their presentation to the rating agencies, and to articulate and discuss their stories in a balanced and efficient manner. It is important to make this distinction. In terms of how Tanzania compares with other countries, there are rules and regulations in place governing activities in the international capital markets that preclude us from discussing this matter in detail, and the process in Tanzania is still in its early stages, but we believe it will not materially differ from other African and emerging markets countries, once it gets going.</p><h4>What milestones do you hope to reach by the end of 2015?</h4><p>Specifically, we would like to have sustained double-digit growth, principally by focusing on improving our client experience, keeping the highest standards of ethics, rigorous controls, and performance management. We want to continue to invest in our people, providing growth opportunities to our Tanzanian staff. We want to simplify our structure without compromising on controls (in fact increasing them), improving our efficiency and our client experience.</p><h4>You have been here for 18 years. Where do you see Citibank in the next 18 years?</h4><p>The long-term strategy is to be able to service this market as it matures to be able to continue to play a role in the growth of the financial sector and the community. We will continue to be a responsible player in the market and hope to continue to be perceived as an institution that adds value to the country, that supports our international and domestic clients, the government, and the banks, and that contributes to Tanzania's development and future. By doing so, we intend to meet our corporate and growth objectives. Ours is a long-term commitment. We are a stakeholder in the country and we have a bias toward the country's continued success.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate Garant Holding's performance in 2013?</h4><p>I am happy to say that 2013 was one of the most successful and productive years in our history. We rebranded the holding with a name more readily understandable in many languages and quickly associated with the various companies that operate under the corporate umbrella. Taking on this new name has galvanized our sense of responsibility and stimulated new initiatives and projects. We are the only holding in Azerbaijan to have been recognized by PricewaterhouseCoopers, and have received ISO 9001:2008 certification from TÜV AUSTRIA Hellas, the International Certification Organization. Another highlight of 2013 was the opening of the luxury Rixos hotel in Guba, a pivotal region in Azerbaijan. By completing such projects, we are contributing to the state program for the social and economic development of other provinces in Azerbaijan through tourism facilities. The project is of considerable importance to the holding, but also to Guba, as it has improved infrastructure, involved local residents, and provided employment.</p><h4>What is the focus of Garant's construction segment?</h4><p>A major success in recent years was our efficient and rapid completion of the Trump Tower project. The challenge that we embraced was to ensure that the style of the building was consistent with the surrounding architecture in Baku, and that the project was sustainable. The main challenge that we are facing now is to promote Baku effectively in the international arena. Meanwhile, the construction arm of Garant continues to work on several large-scale projects.</p><h4>In which areas is the agribusiness branch of Garant engaged?</h4><p>Garant has leveraged the success of its financial branch to diversify, having directed its efforts toward the production and manufacturing of food products. One of the initial steps we have taken in this field is the establishment of Ucar Agro LLC, named after the area in which it is based. This time, we have also remained true to the principle of the development of rural regions of Azerbaijan, employing our best people to ensure success. There are many companies engaged in poultry production, but with demand from local consumers being high we have channeled innovative technologies to meet it, resulting in the introduction of a new brand of poultry product. Our poultry processing operation has an annual production capacity of 17 million (live weight) tons with a cutting rate of 6,000 chickens per hour; it will produce fresh and frozen poultry, whole and sliced. The enterprise is valuable and of great importance in providing employment in rural communities. Overall, 590 workers have been involved directly in our production processes, and 150 people have been engaged in related fields of the enterprise.</p><div class="quote">“  Azerbaijan is a country with a range of available opportunities and conditions for the development of entrepreneurship. "</div><h4>This year has seen the start to the third term in office for President Aliyev. What will this mean for the business community?</h4><p>Azerbaijan is a country with a range of available opportunities and conditions for the development of entrepreneurship. We have the opportunity to operate effectively due to the care and attention of President Ilham Aliyev. As the President has stated, the growth of entrepreneurship in towns and regions will ensure successful national development. He has underlined the need to pursue a liberal economy to this end. In recent years, through the sensible use of incoming exchange reserves from the sale of oil resources, the government has achieved the advantageous base required for the dynamic development of sectors of the economy relevant to strategic, diversified business structures and the development of the broader economy. The generation of oil revenues has contributed to this development and played a pivotal role in the formation and establishment of developmental tendencies within economic and social sectors. Of course, those engaged in entrepreneurial activity will be entering a more large-scale activity phase in large part owing to this productive environment.</p><h4>As the founder of the Azerbaijan America Alliance, how do you evaluate the importance of this bilateral relationship for the country's economic development?</h4><p>The Azerbaijan America Alliance is a non-political, non-profit organization the main goal of which is to deliver broad information regarding the culture, history, way of life, and lifestyle of the country. The Alliance's mission also includes the provision and building of mutual understanding and fostering mutual respect between American and Azerbaijani people. The alliance has arranged successful projects through academic dialogue, cultural programs, and political debates in the US over the span of several years. Our outreach campaign to create awareness of the Khojaly massacre in the US forms a major part of the goals of the alliance, and we have been attempting to convey the importance of this tragedy and crime against humanity to officials there, in order to foster a better understanding of our region's unique geopolitical realities. This program has been focused on informing people in Washington, DC and New York, in order to achieve a high-impact message. My hope is that the Alliance's cultural, political, and economic relations will play an important role in strengthening and promoting more productive and favorable relations.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is Az Group looking to increase its industrial production in 2014, the Year of Industry, in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>In 2013, AZFCO, the dairy production enterprise of the group, succeeded in becoming certified by the US Army to supply US soldiers in Afghanistan with dairy products. There are expansion plans for 2014 to add new cheese, butter, and ice cream lines to the plant. Today, the plant produces a diversity of dairy goods, including 67 varieties of yogurt, milk, probiotic yogurts, and ice creams. Our industrial products are even reaching international markets. AZ Plas, the group's packaging factory, exports to Georgia, whereas AZMDF exports MDF and parquet laminate flooring to Georgia, Iran, and Turkmenistan. The expansion plan for AZMDF 2014 is to add a brand new production line for doors, windows, and kitchen cabinets.</p><h4>Moving to the automotive sector, what led Az Group to commence truck assembly in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Az Group was the first exclusive Isuzu dealer in Azerbaijan. After a while, when Isuzu saw our capability with regard to the automotive industry, it suggested building an assembly line in the region. We reached agreement on how this was to be achieved, and currently the plant is under construction and our first prototype will emerge by February 2015. Today, we are the only company in Azerbaijan that will assemble light and heavy trucks locally. Meanwhile, we opted to assemble Isuzu's models because it is the best truck brand in the world.</p><h4>How will you go about training the workforce for this assembly plant?</h4><p>We are going to send Azerbaijani technicians to Japan and other assembly lines around the world for training. Meanwhile, Isuzu Japan has suggested that we work with the Isuzu assembly plant in order to train our local technicians.</p><div class="quote">“  Our target is to release 50 million fingerlings per year into the Caspian Sea by 2020. "</div><h4>Az Group is also working to build an English language school. What can you tell us about this project?</h4><p>The school that AzEdu, Az Group's educational arm, is building, will be managed and operated by GEMS International, which is the largest private education company worldwide. It will be advising us on how to set up an International Baccalaureate curriculum, which will encompass the US and UK educational systems. The school will be able to accommodate 2,500 students and will be open to expatriates and Azerbaijanis who wish to enroll their children in an English language school. Azerbaijani students who wish to attend university, college, or boarding school abroad will also benefit from this system. The school will make an international education system that meets global standards available to Azerbaijani parents. Therefore, being able to provide a solid education locally, many parents will be spared the separation of sending their children abroad.</p><h4>Can you provide some key metrics for AZ Group?</h4><p>Aztikintiyol manages and runs the production of aggregate and asphalt in the country. It started operations in 2008 with two regional plants, and, since then, we have opened six further plants around the country for these products. Our production capacity has increased, and we can produce 2,400 tons of asphalt per hour, or 57,600 tons of asphalt and 72,000 tons of aggregate per day. By our estimation, this is enough to cover every project in Azerbaijan in 2014. Aztikinti, another company that produces concrete, can produce 1.2 million cubic meters of concrete per year, which would cover 35% of total Azerbaijani demand. AzSole was the first industrial plant of Az Group, and was established in 2006 to provide steel for infrastructure projects. Its initial capacity was 1,000 tons per month, whereas in 2012 it reached a capacity of 3,500 tons per month. We always set ambitious targets that help us to grow.</p><h4>What have been the developments at Caspian Fish, Az Group's sturgeon farm?</h4><p>The farm has in excess of 36,000 sturgeon set to start producing caviar this summer. The current total volume of our fish is approximately 96 tons, which will increase to approximately 400 tons by this summer, when temperatures rise. Also in the summer of 2014, we will see our first dispatch of 2 million fingerlings into the sea. We will also be inviting scientists from Geneva to inspect the farm and make their own estimation of the volume of fish there so that we can obtain a quota for caviar exports. The quota given is normally 10% of the weight of the fish at a farm. Hopefully, for 2015, the quota will make available approximately 30 tons to 40 tons of caviar for export and internal use. Our target is to release 50 million fingerlings per year into the Caspian Sea by 2020, so that future generations can also enjoy wild caviar.</p><h4>Lastly, what are Az Group's social initiatives?</h4><p>Independently of Az Group, I operate the Azerbaijan Animal Rescue Center (AARC), which was founded in 2008 and situated in the center of the city. Subsequently, having decided that our animals needed a much quieter space, we transformed a six-hectare property that was formerly a hotel into a modern and sophisticated animal shelter. Additionally, AzTexnika, our automotive company, sponsored the G3 City Challenge in Baku in 2012. Due to the success of this event, we also sponsored the G3 World Final in October 2013. In September, we organized the event “Polo Returns Home" to celebrate the sport of polo, which originated in Azerbaijan thousands of years ago and was later adopted by the British.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the performance of the Ministry of Taxes in terms of achievements in 2013?<br></h4><p>The achievements of the Ministry of Taxes are based on the results of the country's economic development. The effective economic strategy implemented in Azerbaijan over the past decade has turned the country into one of the fastest growing economies, with GDP increasing more than three-fold. The country achieved overall economic growth of 5.8% in 2013, and an increase of 10% in the non-oil sector. Today, Azerbaijan accounts for 73.6% of the economy of the South Caucasus. This is, of course, a major factor in determining the dynamics of tax revenues, as well as the provision of tax services. At the Ministry, we are satisfied with our progress in 2013, a year characterized by both the fulfillment of fiscal tasks and the modernization of tax services and administration. In 2013, taxpayers were offered services based wholly on the latest international standards. Following discussions with the business community, we launched partnership relationships with taxpayers in 2013. Amendments were also made to tax legislation to specify frameworks for partnership agreements. We have already seen the signing of the first agreements. Entrepreneurs show considerable interest in this issue, and it will remain one of the key activities of 2014. Meanwhile, measures such as introducing electronic audits, addressing tax risks, and reducing tax debts are further examples of the successes of 2013.</p><h4>How does the government use the tax policy to stimulate economic diversification and investment in priority areas?</h4><p>All countries extracting natural resources, including Azerbaijan, are challenged by the problem of economic diversification. It is of utmost importance to ensure that the economy is safe and the domestic market is protected from varying impacts from the world market. Each state seeks to raise the competitiveness of its economy to ensure sustainable development. The economic course of Azerbaijan run by the President of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, aims at building an economy based on the development of the non-oil sector and the introduction of high-level technologies. The Azerbaijan 2020: Outlook for the Future development concept is an indicator of the resolute actions taken by the government in this direction. The concept specifies in the mid-term perspective the following: forming a diverse, efficient, and innovation-oriented economy; turning Azerbaijan into a regional investment hub; achieving development in the social sector; ensuring the welfare of people at an internationally accepted level; and developing scientific, cultural, and social life. It is a widespread international practice to make use of tax policy to stimulate economic growth, which is particularly distinctive for developing countries with low tax loads. We call this an active tax policy. The introduction of tax privileges with the consideration of fiscal loads in tax policy is becoming a widely applied practice in the key development areas in Azerbaijan. Agriculture, one of the key sectors comprising GDP, has long been practically exempted from tax, which undoubtedly contributed to development of the agrarian sector. Ilham Aliyev, the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan, has declared 2014 the Year of Industry. A range of works is being carried out to establish techno-parks, which will likely play a major role in the formation of new areas in the national economy and making them competitive. In this manner, to stimulate the development of industrial parks and techno-parks in the mid- and long-term perspectives, legal and natural entities operating at such parks enjoy tax exemptions for a period of seven years, whereas the managing organizations and operators of these parks are exempt from taxes for an unlimited period.</p><h4>What is the role of the tax policy regarding the promotion of the use of renewable energy?</h4><p>The State Program on the Use of Alternative and Renewable Energy Sources in the Republic of Azerbaijan approved by Order No. 462 of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan on October 21, 2004, is a key document in this area. In accordance with Paragraph 3 of the Plan of Action for the Use of Alternative Energy Sources, the Ministry of Taxes, to stimulate the use of alternative energy sources and create a favorable investment climate, has proposed specific amendments to relevant legislation to exempt raw materials and equipment imported for production purposes from VAT.</p><div class="quote">“At present, 91% of tax declarations submitted by taxpayers to the Ministry of Taxes are submitted electronically. "</div><h4>What are the most important changes in the simplification of the tax system?</h4><p>Reforms in the area of tax services envisage the fulfillment of several significant duties to be addressed within the national system. First, the tax system must be stable and predictable. Second, the tax administration has to be convenient and favorable to the greatest extent possible. Third, the stimulation of the role of the tax system in forming the structure of the economy and supporting innovations must show more progress. Finally, the tax system and its administration in Azerbaijan need to be more competitive. The tax system has to be simple and favorable for businesses, competitive and efficient for the state, and manageable for tax services from the point of view of administration. These are the key principles followed in all tax reforms. The Ministry of Taxes has achieved a considerable reduction in officeholder-citizen contacts by continuing the application of electronic services in all spheres of tax administration. The latest electronic technologies are used to facilitate the contact of taxpayers with the tax authorities, from registration to the submission of declarations, and from the payment of taxes to tax control. Doing Business 2014 included Azerbaijan in its top 10 list of countries to have successfully carried out reforms regarding the starting up of businesses. Reforms in 2011 and 2012 in the area of the state registration of entrepreneurship entities, particularly in the digitized registration of citizens and legal entities by electronic means, are some of the main reasons for this favorable reputation. The number of procedures and the time required to register a business in Azerbaijan is less than the average indicators of OECD members, as well as Eastern European and Central Asian countries. In addition, the average time spent on the completion and submission of tax declarations, as well as compliance with legislative norms for the payment of taxes, is relatively better than the average statistics of Central Asian and Eastern European countries and the world in general. At present, 91% of tax declarations submitted by taxpayers to the Ministry of Taxes are sent electronically. By continuing the digitization of tax services and introducing new services, we are likely to achieve impressive progress.</p><h4>The government declared 2013 the Year of ICT. How did your organization benefit from its achievements?</h4><p>The introduction of information and communication technologies in the national tax service is an important development. President Ilham Aliyev declared 2013 the Year of ICT, which gave an additional incentive to further accelerate and broaden related efforts. “ASAN Imza," or Mobile ID, was one of the projects initiated by the national tax service within the Year of ICT. ASAN Imza, in combination with the creation of a security system, has helped users to display their digital identity via mobile phones. To ensure its effective operation, the new Certification Services Center for electronic signatures has been set up in the Ministry of Taxes, which was integrated with the Mobile ID center established by an international consortium with the participation of companies from France, Sweden, Estonia, and Azerbaijan. Since the Center was established in compliance with European standards, it created the possibility for the mutual recognition of electronic signatures with European countries, which has created a favorable environment for Azerbaijani citizens when establishing joint ventures with citizens of other countries and signing agreements electronically online. The new system allows the use of electronic signatures for all devices, including computers, tablets, and smartphones. Notwithstanding the short period, some 24,000 Mobile ID certificates have been issued to its holders across 2,000,000 transactions. Today, the Mobile ID project is not just a tax service, but a national brand offered as an original product. This project came about as a joint effort with our Estonian colleagues, and fully meets all the quality and security parameters required for mobile IDs in Europe. In February 2014, the Mobile ID was presented as an original Azerbaijani product to the European Parliament in Brussels. It is also worth noting that the Mobile ID is a competitive and export-oriented product of Azerbaijan. Currently, several countries are closely interested in this project. During the Year of ICT, the Ministry of Taxes extended the scope of electronic services, and currently offers taxpayers 51 electronic services.</p><h4>How will the 2014 reduction in the amount of transfers from the State Oil Fund (SOFAZ) to the state budget affect the operation of your organization and tax collections?</h4><p>In a meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers held in 2010 and following the main development directions of 2011, President Ilham Aliyev tasked the relevant government bodies with ensuring that revenues collected by the Ministry of Taxes and other authorities are sufficient to cover public budget expenditures, and that transfers from SOFAZ shall be spent only on investment projects. At present, this is a strategic necessity for the key target areas of the national tax service. We have observed a 55.2% increase in tax revenues over the past three years. Increases in revenues in the non-oil sector reached 59.7%. In general, the growth rate of tax revenues in the non-oil sector exceeds the growth rate of GDP in this field. In the past three years, growth in non-oil GDP constituted 9.4% in 2011, 9.7% in 2012, and 10% in 2013, whereas the volume of non-oil revenues reached 21.9% in 2011, and 14.5% in 2012 and 2013. To put it another way, the level of increase in non-oil revenues exceeded the real increase of GDP in the non-oil sector by 2.3 times in 2011, 1.5 times in 2012, and 1.4 times in 2013. This tendency gives us reason to believe that we must continue the process of discovering new potential taxation bases and applying efficient tax control measures. The share of the non-oil sector in overall tax revenues is projected to reach 60.5% in 2014.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the contribution of the Central Bank of Azerbaijan (CBAR) to the economic accomplishments of 2013?<br></h4><p>Last year was particularly successful for the Azerbaijani economy, where growth, primarily driven by the non-oil sector, exceeded average global and CIS growth rates. Moreover, the actively pursued diversification policy boosted the share of the non-oil sector in GDP, and the country maintained macroeconomic stability amid dynamic growth. Despite double-digit growth in the non-oil sector and high investment demand, average annual inflation in 2013 was at a low 2.4%. Azerbaijan's international ratings further improved to this backdrop. In the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report, Azerbaijan rose seven positions to 39th place. It also rose by 10 positions to eighth in the world in terms of macroeconomic stability and sustainability. As the institution tasked with doing so, the CBAR succeeded in maintaining macroeconomic stability, the key prerequisite of balanced economic growth, utilizing the stabilizing and promotional capacity of the monetary policy in light of the economic environment. In parallel, the CBAR introduced flexible financial stability management tools to regulate risks and prevent overheating in the banking sector. And to contribute to economic diversification, the CBAR was actively involved in the implementation of the government's economic policy, promoting financial deepening of the banking sector, and the development of financial infrastructure.</p><h4>The CBAR decided to postpone the rise in minimum capital requirements for banks by one year. What factors informed this decision?</h4><p>The reason why we raised the capital requirement was to deepen financial intermediation, elevate service quality, adjust to capitalization-related global challenges, and enhance the sector's financial sustainability. The decision was also made as part of the banking sector's long-run growth concept. The sector enjoys a high potential to harmonize to the process. Today, the capital of 23 banks owning 84% of banking sector assets exceeds AZN50 billion. The CBAR supervises banks' capitalization on an ongoing basis aided by a critical support for banks. A number of banks have already unveiled their capitalization plans to the public. The process will be problem free both for the sector and consumers, as in previous periods. The banking system's capital adequacy ratio (CAR) reached 17.3% on three percentage point growth YoY. The ratio exceeds international standards two fold and the CBAR threshold by five percentage points. This performance demonstrates the banking sector's attractiveness for investment, as well as its reliability, financial stability, sustainability, and capacity to successfully adapt to the new capital requirements. The new capitalization level markedly widened the banks' potential to credit the economy, as well as service the real sector and the population alike. In parallel, it will play a large part in reducing the cost of banking services and products through high competition and a scale effect in the banking sector. Given the above, and other banks' high capitalization potential, as well as the ability to secure funds of bank creditors and depositors and protect the sector's overall financial stability, the Management Board of the CBAR extended the capital adjustment period from November 14, 2013 until January 1, 2015.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the soundness of the Azerbaijani banking sector?</h4><p>Sustained stability and growth are prevalent in the Azerbaijani banking system. Between 2003 and 2013, sector assets rose by a factor of 20, while the credit portfolio grew by a factor of 23, and deposits 17 fold. Soviet-era deposits have been recovered at the most favorable conditions observed anywhere in the CIS community. The banking sector had remained stable and trustworthy even during the global economic crisis. Foreign exchange and capital flows have been liberalized in the country. And, in general, we expect the new capital requirements of banks to underpin the implementation of the Basel III accord. We have been successfully applying the leverage ratio—one of the key protective instruments of Basel III—in Azerbaijan since 2011. Moreover, the CBAR has already made corrections to, and is applying relevant regulations, within the framework of improving banking capital structure and quality. The CBAR is also focused on banking sector liquidity. We have evaluated options to introduce two new tools recommended by the Basel Committee. Although the liquidity coverage ratio is in essence similar to the instant liquidity ratio currently applied in Azerbaijan, that is to say, it targets a short-run liquidity regulation, it is a more complex and advanced tool. We have diagnosed the ratio in question and discussed its application prospects in the banking sector. The CBAR now plans to apply this ratio as a normative requirement in the coming period. As for the net stable funding ratio, the tool is being globally debated and needs to be tested. The CBAR has decided to review this ratio in the coming periods, too, given its possible negative impact on the balance between financial stability and long-term economic growth-financing policies. In 2014, the macro- and micro-prudential policy will be oriented toward the management of overheating in the banking system via systemic regulation and individual supervision to ensure financial stability. The Basel III standards will be tailored to the local environment, and the development of counter-cyclical banking supervision continued.</p><div class="quote">“Between 2003 and 2013, sector assets rose by a factor of 20, while the credit portfolio grew by a factor of 23, and deposits 17 fold. "</div><h4>What role can the CBAR play in enhancing financial inclusion, and how would the latter contribute to economic growth?</h4><p>Naturally, financial inclusion is generally among the key factors in ensuring the inclusiveness of economic growth. The prerequisite here is to expand access to financial resources and high-quality financial services. The CBAR is currently taking the necessary stimulating measures to increase the financial deepening of the banking sector. Increased financial deepening directly serves to expand the available credit resources in the economy. In this sphere, necessary measures oriented at stimulating increased cashless settlements were taken over 2013. Likewise, a number of regulative and policy measures were taken in order to facilitate the reduction of interest rates. Particular attention has been paid to increasing the banking sector's activity in the regions and in the non-oil economy. The development of microfinance and rural banking is amongst the priorities for us. The expansion of financial-banking infrastructure, the institutional development of the financial-banking sector, and increasing the efficiency of financial intermediation serve to strengthening financial inclusion as well. Ultimately, the CBAR's activities are oriented at the flexible transformation of reserves accumulated in the economy to economic growth, mobilizing them through the banking sector. This will provide access to additional investment resources for businesses, and enable the population to further improve their living standards, enjoying financial services.</p><h4>In late 2013, President Ilham Aliyev won a third sweeping victory at the polls. What do you expect his third term to bring in terms of economic growth and monetary stability?</h4><p>We are fairly optimistic with respect to economic growth in Azerbaijan in the coming five years. This optimism is due to the strong economic achievements of the past 10 years and the new economic strategy underway. Azerbaijan has entered the league of medium-income countries following the explosive growth witnessed over the past decade. Both the Azerbaijani government and international organizations predict a stable and dynamic growth pattern for the Azerbaijani economy in the medium term. As such, the country's ratings are improving faster than ever, thus boosting investor confidence in the economy. Azerbaijan has become one of the most attractive investment destinations for the financial sector. The new strategic growth course targets constant growth of the national income through the shaping of diversification, export-oriented growth, knowledge, and innovation, which will pave the way to new, quality, high growth rates for the national economy. The CBAR is working to maintain macroeconomic stability and the international competitiveness of the non-oil economy, contributing to low-level inflation. At the same time, the banking sector will be promoted far and wide to make a great figure in the full-blast capitalization of the non-oil economy. It will continuously undergo structural reforms to that end.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you give a brief description about the new sales activities carried out by Audi in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>It has been approximately two years since our company, European Cars Ltd, became the official distributor of Audi in Azerbaijan. Public interest has always been high for Audi products during this period of time. From the first day, our aims were to place this brand in its rightful place and increase the reputation of these cars once they were in Azerbaijan. This goal has been achieved by the implementation of Audi-specific market policy, which includes providing high-end after-sales service to our customers. The organization of proper after-sales service is an answer to many questions about our success. Audi is a premium brand, and this makes it vital that we offer a premium service at a reasonable price in all criteria of our work.</p><h4>What improvements has Audi made for the sake of increasing its market share in 2013, and what achievements do you expect in 2014?</h4><p>We will do our best in order to steadily increase our customer base. In addition, we are planning on starting the construction of the new Audi Terminal, which will include a showroom and after-sales area all in one location. This facility will offer a variety of services and will be more convenient for Audi customers in the long run.</p><h4>What differentiates Audi from other high-quality car brands in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Audi models have always been ahead of their competitors in terms of dynamic handling. Audi applies the technology used in racing cars into daily road vehicles, which, in the long run, makes the cars more dynamic, durable, and safe. In collaboration with all these features, Audi models are efficient consumers of fuel in comparison to the competition. Also, they can adapt to different road conditions thanks to the multilink suspension system. Audi Exclusive offers a wide range of individual options for customers who want to experience the difference. The Audi Exclusive program offers a variety of leather options and different types of natural wooden décors for the interior, as well as technical advantages that standard production vehicles do not have. Audi has another major advantage over its competitors, which is called the quattro all-wheel-drive system. The biggest advantage of quattro is that this system is completely mechanical and does not depend on any sensors or clutches like its competitors. The quattro system is just as effective on smooth roads as it is in bad road conditions.</p><h4>How did you deal with the competition between auto dealers in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Before entering a competitive market, it is essential to research the specific demand for a given product, which later brings us to the point of preparing a proposal based on the findings. Today, we offer highly competitive products in accordance with the findings that we witnessed from our market research.</p><h4>How has the country's economic development benefited the local auto market?</h4><p>The economic development of a country is equivalent to the improved financial status of its citizens, and this will definitely play a positive role in the success of the automobile business, which is the pulse of the modern world in all areas of social life.</p><h4>Ilham Aliyev was elected as President for the third time in 2013. How do you think this new era will affect the automotive industry?</h4><p>The magnificent victory in the elections of our President Ilham Aliyev is a symbol of development, prosperity, and success, as well as a victory for the luxury lifestyle sector. Luxury lifestyle means having access to luxury cars, such as Audi, and we believe that it will be a positive.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were last year's accomplishments for Akkord?<br></h4><p>Overall, 2013 was a challenging but, at the same time, successful year for Akkord Corporation in terms of sustainability. We have overcome all the challenges we faced through innovative thinking. The company has implemented some major projects on a national scale, including launching the first production line of the Gazakh Cement Plant, opening a multi-level, tunnel-type road junction in Galaba (Victory) Square in Baku, and signing a contract for the construction of a new Khatai Hazi Aslanov-2 section of the Baku Metro Green Line. These three large-scale projects became milestones for Akkord Corporation as it constantly strives to extend the frontiers of its activities. The company has also managed to break down stereotypes associated with its image as a solely construction-oriented company. It is noteworthy that launching the Gazakh Cement Plant comes in line with the implementation of the State Program for the Social and Economic Development of the Regions of the Republic of Azerbaijan for 2009-2013, as it plays an important role in the socioeconomic development of both the Gazakh region and the country as a whole. Besides satisfying domestic cement demand, we are aiming to expand our global cement production footprint and become a regionally competitive cement producer. In addition to these achievements, in April 2013, Akkord Corporation was awarded Best Enterprise in the Field of Construction in the South Caucasus and Central Asia by the Institute of Directors at the Europe Business Assembly in London. Later that year, the company became a corporate affiliate member of the International Tunnelling and Underground Space Association (ITA-AITES) and World Road Association (PIARC). Akkord Corporation is the first and only private company from the South Caucasus that is affiliated to these highly reputable organizations.<br></p><h4>How is the Baku Metro project progressing?</h4><p>As for the Baku Metro project, metro tunneling and underground construction is a new business line for Akkord. A long-term conceptual development scheme for the Baku Metro that was prepared following a Presidential decree of November 10, 2008, and the State Program for the Development of the Baku Metro in 2011-2015, approved by a Presidential decree on March 18, 2011, has laid the groundwork for the Metro's expansion plans. To contribute to the program, Akkord Corporation has entered into a partnership with France's Bouygues Travaux Publics, which is one of the largest global experts in underground work. The contract, signed on December 16, 2013, has crowned our two-year joint efforts to develop the construction project for a new Khatai-Azi Aslanov-2 section of the “Green Line." In the future, we anticipate concluding more similar contracts, as the Metro development plan stipulates the construction of additional 50 stations. The company continuously develops its expertise in this area, so it could be involved in other relevant projects around the country.</p><h4>What major undertakings are underway in 2014?</h4><p>Being not only a construction enterprise, but also a production and investment company, Akkord Corporation nowadays continues to invest heavily in the production and processing of building materials. The company's orientation to the country's manufacturing sector comes in line with President Ilham Aliyev's socio-economic development program for 2014-2018. The Head of State restated that the development of the non-oil sector remains Azerbaijan's top priority in the economic sphere this year and has declared 2014 the Year of Industry. As a leading building materials supplier, Akkord Corporation aims to support the President's decision and will continue to produce cement, concrete and concrete precasts, asphalt, marble, granite, steel structures, gravel, sand, bricks, and other materials not only for our own needs, but also for the wider market in Azerbaijan. This will be possible due to 40 manufacturing and processing facilities that the corporation owns and operates throughout the country. These facilities are located close to raw material sources and project sites, which allows us to enhance production efficiency and optimize project costs. We also have plans to increase the production of building materials, including fiber concrete, at our pre-fabrication plant. This year, such new entities as Gazakh Cement Plant, Akkord Prefabrik (precast concrete plant), Akkord Beton, and Garadag Marble and Granite Plant will commence operations within the Industry Group set by Akkord Corporation this February. Through heavy investments into industry and manufacturing, pioneering the application of new technologies and know-how, Akkord Corporation is making a substantial contribution to the development of the country's production sector and will adhere closely to this line of work. Besides that, Akkord Corporation has passed the pre-qualification stage to bid for the Trans-Anatolian Gas Pipeline (TANAP) project, and we plan to continue participating in tenders under this and Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) proj­ects.  The internationally recognized brand that Akkord Corporation has managed to build over the years enables the company to contribute to these projects, which will have profound impact on the world energy marketplace. I would like to stress that we are focused on bridging all the areas of our activity and building a sustainable business model. The scale of investment reflects Akkord Corporation's policy of vertical integration, and this policy and investment in production facilities that it requires will continue this year.</p><h4>What projects is Akkord working on abroad?</h4><p>Currently, Akkord Corporation has a very strong presence not only in Azerbaijan but also in several foreign markets including Turkey, Germany, Albania, Georgia, Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Ukraine. The success of our international projects is largely based on cooperation with leading construction and engineering companies through different forms of partnership. The corporation has reached agreements with some globally renowned companies, such as Hochtief and Bouguyes Travaux Publics, our partners in the joint venture for the Baku Metro project. Recently, the Azerbaijan-Italian Akkord-Todini-Impregilo Joint Venture has won the tender to implement road construction works under the CAREC III Corridor, Shymkent-Tashkent Project in Kazakhstan. Akkord Corporation has been participating in the Western Europe-Western China International Transit Corridor project since 2010. In total, the Corporation is implementing tens of high-complexity large infrastructure projects across the Caspian-Black Sea region.</p><h4>How important are human resources to Akkord?</h4><p>As one of the major employers in Azerbaijan, Akkord Corporation contributes significantly to the formation of a positive work environment and corporate culture. The corporation considers human capital as its most important asset to maintaining sustainable growth, and is doing its utmost to attract, retain, inspire, and motivate people working in the company. Nowadays, more than 4,000 employees including specialists from the UK, Germany, Italy, France, Portugal, Ukraine, Bangladesh, Russia, Georgia, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Iran, and Turkey are involved in daily operations domestically and abroad, and the key objective for us is to have right motivation tools and to offer various benefits to enable them to perform at their best. The company is constantly striving to balance the needs of the business with its employees' expectations. We believe that all our employees add value to our business, and their contribution to our common success does not go unnoticed or remain undervalued. Thus, this year Akkord Corporation is starting an initiative to congratulate hundreds of employees working in the company for five years or more to recognize and praise their loyalty to the company and work for its prosperity. Akkord Corporation is investing heavily in manpower and is widely reputed as a company employing highly qualified personnel in every country where it operates. We are keen to deviate from a common practice in the construction sector to work with sub-contractors, because we believe that developing and training our own employees will be more beneficial in the long run when it comes to building a highly successful business, not only in profit, but also in culture.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[regional-roots]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe PASHA Bank's performance in 2013?<br></h4><p>Overall, 2013 represented a new phase of institution-building for PASHA Bank, following the initial process that took place at the time of our foundation in 2007. We accomplished numerous “firsts" during 2013, such as the first club loan, which we implemented in collaboration with a group of international financial intuitions. We have received high ratings from international rating agencies; in fact, the highest among Azerbaijani private banks with 100% local capital. In 2013, we also expanded our operations and appeal to the market. For the first time in our history, we started appealing directly to international institutional investors invited on road shows held abroad, which helped promote PASHA Bank as a gateway to Azerbaijan for financial institutions and investors. We are one of the most active banks in the securities market in Azerbaijan, and we trade government securities and are involved in a number of bond issues. We have issued bonds for several financial institutions and leasing companies. In terms of results, we ended the year with a profit, although slightly behind the budgeted figure we had planned for ourselves. The overall dynamics of the YoY growth have been positive. We are the only financial institution in Azerbaijan that makes its forecasts public—this reflects the level of confidence and transparency to which we adhere.</p><h4>What services does the new SME Business Center provide to enhance the SME experience at PASHA Bank?</h4><p>Investments in the SME sector are an integral part of our growth strategy. We want the SMEs of today to grow into the large corporates of tomorrow. In 2011, we started developing this strategy and building a relevant client base. In 2012 and 2013, we conducted a number of SME campaigns and, starting from 2013, we began building up a portfolio of small clients. In order to ensure that we are close to our SME clients, we opened our first Business Banking Center in 2013, which renders services to small companies that employ about 10-15 people and have an annual turnover of between AZN200,000 and AZN2 million. We plan to open more centers in 2014 in the belief that SMEs will play an important role in our future business. PASHA Bank offers its clients an internet banking platform to render banking easier and more accessible. In fact, the bank has developed a whole range of innovative banking products, while offering other value-added services that will contribute to the financial and institutional growth of SMEs. Although we are not a retail bank, we are prepared to look after our SMEs both in terms of their business and personal financial needs.</p><h4>What updates are being planned for PASHA Bank's internet platform?</h4><p>Thanks to the internet banking platform that we launched two years ago, the volume of our transactions has increased and many of our corporate clients have embraced this service. Our branches remain busy, and the platform is still small compared to some European or North American banks; however, this simply represents a growth opportunity for us. Over half of our highly active corporate clients have adopted internet banking within the past 18 months. We are now planning a second update to our platform to make it even more tailored to customers' needs. Obviously though, direct banking solutions will remain important for corporate clients. In 2014, we will be implementing both MIS and CRM systems. We are also working on our treasury management system with one of the world's top IT solutions companies. In 2014, we will be introducing Phase II of our credit management model. We have made substantial investments in IT in order to increase service standards and operational efficiency. Technology saves clients' time, which is an important asset. However, as a bank that values relationships with customers, we are keen to strike the right balance between technology and personalized attention.</p><div class="quote">“  In order to ensure that we are close to our SME clients, we opened our first Business Banking Center in 2013. "</div><h4>What does the bank's corporate social responsibility (CSR) platform consist of?</h4><p>As a company that has adopted corporate governance principles, we recognize the community as one of our stakeholders; therefore, we keep it in our books, minds, and hearts. One of our CSR mandates fosters economic development by investing in human capital and financial education. Therefore, our CSR is mostly aimed at educational programs. We identify talented young students and send them to prestigious business schools abroad. We have also established a PASHA Bank scholarship for the students of economic universities; therefore they can have sufficient resources to work on their education, buy the books they need, and have fewer financial worries so that they concentrate more on their studies. PASHA Bank also supports business case study competitions between young economists aged between 18 and 22 years old, which helps to foster a culture of entrepreneurship. In tandem with the British Council, the bank has been organizing financial journalism courses for Azerbaijani journalists. Experienced specialists from the Thomson Reuters Foundation teach Azerbaijani journalists how to read economic data and write financial news. It is possible to earn money responsibly, and we believe we have struck the right balance in doing just that. Going forward, we believe that approach will support our ambition to grow returns on our social investments as well. It is a long-term plan, and this is exactly why we are doing this—we are not here for short-term profit.</p><h4>How has the Georgian subsidiary of PASHA Bank performed to date, and what new markets are you looking at?</h4><p>It is actually doing better than we had budgeted for, and we celebrated its first anniversary on January 17, 2014. I believe that Georgia will be an important, integral part of our regional operations. We are a regional bank with an aspiration to become a financial gateway on the “regional triangle" between Baku, Tbilisi, and Istanbul. The Azerbaijani banking system is very young, and hardly any bank, except for the International Bank of Azerbaijan, has expanded into international markets. Going forward, on the back of our regional international ambitions, we will be proud in the future to have developed further international operations to announce.</p><h4>How can banking sector penetration be increased?</h4><p>Azerbaijan's relatively low banking penetration rate constitutes in itself an opportunity for growth. The potential for the market is huge, and we believe we can grow significantly in Azerbaijan. Things are changing fast and, over the past 10 years, we have seen huge growth in savings as Azerbaijanis have become more educated about, and trusting of, the banking system.</p><h4>What are your aspirations for PASHA Bank in 2014?</h4><p>Our aspirations are in step with national goals because as a responsible corporate citizen, we respect our roots. At the same time, we have roots in Georgia and expect to take root in Turkey as well. Our ambition is to become a regional bank capable of diversifying its client and asset base across the region, and benefiting from regional growth and international trade. We want to increase our market share in all our markets, but particularly in Azerbaijan, which will be helped by the new strategy for 2015-2017.</p>]]></richbody0content>
